  :title: OUNA- SHAPING THE FUTURE OF HUMAN RESOURCES
  :content: <p>The most valuable resource of many organizations is the human factor
    — the people employed within them. The abilities to source, engage, and retain
    qualified talents are some of the main catalysts in driving the long-term success
    of an organization. With fierce competition for talents across all industries,
    the ability to source suitable talents is a top priority in organizations of all
    sizes.</p><p>Nowadays, the available processes in the market for human resource
    recruiting are imperfect and suffer from various inefficiencies. These processes
    are highly dependent on human judgement, use tools and technologies that don’t
    provide sufficiently accurate matching results for employers and employees, are
    not intuitive, are very costly and timeconsuming, and have low success rates.</p><p>Recruiting
    criteria-matching talents for employment positions is a high-risk process, since
    recruiting the wrong person has the potential to severely damage the productivity
    of teams, lose clients, reduce efficiencies, increase costs, and lower profits.</p><p><strong>OUNA
    will be the first-of-its-kind blockchain-based, peer-to-peer HR assessment and
    recruitment ecosystem</strong>. The core of the OUNA platform is based on a novel
    algorithm, referenced as the “Analyzer”.** The Analyzer is an online Pyramidal
    Assessment tool that is based on 15 years of research and tested in more than
    100 real-life case studies.** During this assessment period, the Analyzer consistently
    generated candidate profiles for recruitment which resulted in an average success
    rate of 86% in compatibility between employers and their employees, validating
    the algorithm’s ability to accurately match employees’ skills with employers’
    requirements. In 2017, the IP for the Analyzer algorithm was acquired by OUNA
    with the aim of establishing the OUNA ecosystem, the first decentralized platform
    for precise peer-to-peer HR recruitment.</p><h2>EMPLOYEES</h2><p>Job-seekers can
    now choose to perform OUNA’s anonymous, global, decentralized Pyramidal Assessment.
    The online assessment utilizes 12 key parameters, and 40 significant skills are
    taken into consideration. The results are a uniquely accurate candidate profile,
    with an average validity of 86% — achieved while the profile remains totally anonymous.
    All this helping employees to identify and strive towards their ideal career destinies.</p><h2>EMPLOYERS</h2><p>By
    utilizing the OUNA platform, employers can now determine the perfect employee
    profile for each of their available positions. Harnessing OUNA’s comprehensive
    candidate assessment abilities, companies can identify those candidates that are
    best suited to their vacancies, enabling these companies to consistently select
    and recruit highly suitable employees — thereby saving time, money, and effort,
    enhancing employee job satisfaction and improving employee retention — ultimately
    enhancing overall company performance and profitability.</p><ol><li><p>Prospective
    candidates log into the OUNA platform and complete the Pyramidal Motivations assessment.</p></li><li><p>The
    results are transformed into unique mathematical profiles, and are added to the
    OUNA database. Processing of the profiles is controlled by Smart Contracts.</p></li><li><p>Employers
    log into the OUNA platform and generate THE IDEAL EMPLOYEE PROFILE by evaluating
    the best performing employees with OUNA’s Pyramidal Motivation Assessment.</p></li><li><p>The
    employer runs this PROFILE through OUNA’s database and identifies the candidate
    profiles that best match their requirements.</p></li></ol><h2>FEATURES</h2><p>OUNA’s
    candidate assessment yields a completely anonymous profile, based only on the
    individual’s skills, motivational factors, and values. OUNA is therefore able
    to be fully committed to the principle of equal opportunity employment. OUNA can
    and will help the struggle against discrimination against a job applicant or an
    employee because of the person’s race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
    age, or disability.</p><h2>ALGORITHM</h2><p>OUNA ecosystem will continue to expand
    as more candidates are added to the OUNA candidate database — and more HR recruiters
    discover the power and advantages of working with OUNA.</p><h2><strong>DATABASE</strong></h2><p>OUNA’s
    candidate database currently includes thousands of profiles, containing comprehensive,
    trustworthy, blockchain-based records of their strengths, motivating factors,
    and ideal work environments.</p><p><strong>To learn more about our project, please

  :content: '<p>Blockchain is not only crappy technology but a bad vision for the
    future. Its failure to achieve adoption to date is because systems built on trust,
    norms, and institutions inherently function better than the type of no-need-for-trusted-parties

    improves it is still headed in the wrong direction.</p><p>This December I wrote

    start with this: Venmo is a free service to transfer dollars, and bitcoin transfers
    are not free. Yet after I wrote<a href="https://medium.com/@kaistinchcombe/ten-years-in-nobody-has-come-up-with-a-use-case-for-blockchain-ee98c180100">
    an article last December</a> saying bitcoin had no use, someone<a href="https://medium.com/@aaronjmendelsohn/there-is-so-much-wrong-with-this-i-couldnt-get-through-it-all-2dd24a109e0c">
    responded</a> that Venmo and Paypal are raking in consumers’ money and people
    should switch to bitcoin.</p><p>What a surreal contrast between blockchain’s non-usefulness/non-adoption
    and the conviction of its believers! It’s so entirely evident that this person
    didn’t become a bitcoin enthusiast because they were looking for a convenient,
    free way to transfer money from one person to another and discovered bitcoin.
    In fact, I would assert that there is <em>no single person in existence</em> who
    had a problem they wanted to solve, discovered that an available blockchain solution
    was the best way to solve it, and therefore became a blockchain enthusiast.</p><blockquote><h1>There
    is <em>no single person in existence</em> who had a problem they wanted to solve,

    and Walmart have gone long on press but short on actual rollout. Even the most
    prominent blockchain company, Ripple, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-25/ripple-wants-xrp-to-be-bitcoin-for-banks-if-only-the-banks-wanted-it">doesn’t
    use blockchain in its product</a>. You read that right: the company <em>Ripple</em>
    decided the best way to move money across international borders was to <em>not
    use Ripples</em>.</p><h3>A blockchain is a literal technology, not a metaphor</h3><p>Why
    all the enthusiasm for something so useless in practice?</p><p>People have made
    a number of implausible claims about the future of blockchain—like that you <a
    href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/12/23/why-you-want-blockchain-based-ai-even-if-you-dont-know-it-yet/">should
    use it for AI</a> in place of the type of behavior-tracking that google and facebook
    do, for example. This is based on a misunderstanding of what a blockchain is.
    A blockchain isn’t an ethereal thing out there in the universe that you can “put”
    things into, it’s a specific data structure: a linear transaction log, typically
    replicated by computers whose owners (called miners) are rewarded for logging
    new transactions.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*O2IXj90Y2XxXdZRpwt8wkw.png"
    alt="In The Golden Compass, Dust permeates the world. It is created by consciousness
    and is itself conscious, and can condense into angels. Blockchain is not like
    that."><em>In The Golden Compass, Dust permeates the world. It is created by consciousness
    and is itself conscious, and can condense into angels. Blockchain is not like
    that.</em></p><p>There are two things that are cool about this particular data
    structure. One is that a change in any block invalidates every block after it,
    which means that you can’t tamper with historical transactions. The second is
    that you only get rewarded if you’re working on the same chain as everyone else,
    so each participant has an incentive to go with the consensus.</p><p>The end result
    is a shared definitive historical record. And, what’s more, because consensus
    is formed by each person acting in their own interest, adding a false transaction
    or working from a different history just means you’re not getting paid and everyone
    else is. Following the rules is mathematically enforced—no government or police
    force need come in and tell you the transaction you’ve logged is false (or extort
    bribes or bully the participants). It’s a powerful idea.</p><p>So in summary,
    here’s what blockchain-the-technology is: <em>“Let’s create a very long sequence
    of small files — each one containing a hash of the previous file, some new data,
    and the answer to a difficult math problem — and divide up some money every hour
    among anyone willing to certify and store those files for us on their computers.”</em></p><p>Now,
    here’s what blockchain-the-metaphor is: <em>“What if everyone keeps their records
    in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone?”</em></p><p>An illustration
    of the difference: In 2006, Walmart launched a system to track its bananas and
    mangoes from field to store. In 2009 they abandoned it because of logistical problems
    getting everyone to enter the data, and in 2017 they re-launched it (to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22six%20days,%2018%20hours,%20and%2026%20minutes%22">much
    fanfare</a>) on blockchain. If someone comes to you with “the mango-pickers don’t
    like doing data entry,” “I know: let’s create a very long sequence of small files,
    each one containing a hash of the previous file” is a nonsense answer, but “What
    if everyone keeps their records in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone?”
    at least addresses the right question!</p><h3>Blockchain-based trustworthiness
    falls apart in practice</h3><p>People treat blockchain as a “futuristic integrity
    wand”—wave a blockchain at the problem, and suddenly your data will be valid.
    For almost anything people want to be <em>valid</em>, blockchain has been proposed
    as a solution.</p><p>It’s true that tampering with data stored on a blockchain
    is hard, but it’s false that blockchain is a good way to create data that has
    integrity.</p><blockquote><h1>It’s true that tampering with data stored on a blockchain
    is hard, but it’s false that blockchain is a good way to create data that has
    integrity.</h1></blockquote><p>To understand why this is the case, let’s work
    from the practical to the theoretical. For example, let’s consider a widely-proposed
    use case for blockchain: buying an e-book with a “smart” contract. The goal of
    the blockchain is, you don’t trust an e-book vendor and they don’t trust you (because
    you’re just two individuals on the internet), but, because it’s on blockchain,
    you’ll be able to trust the transaction.</p><p>In the traditional system, once
    you pay you’re <em>hoping</em> you’ll receive the book, but once the vendor has
    your money they don’t have any incentive to deliver. You’re relying on Visa or
    Amazon or the government to make things fair—what a recipe for being a chump!
    In contrast, on a blockchain system, by executing the transaction as a record
    in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone, the transfer of money and digital
    product is automatic, atomic, and direct, with no middleman needed to arbitrate
    the transaction, dictate terms, and take a fat cut on the way. Isn’t that better
    for everybody?</p><p>Hm. Perhaps you are very skilled at writing software. When
    the novelist proposes the smart contract, you take an hour or two to make sure
    that the contract will withdraw only an amount of money equal to the agreed-upon
    price, and that the book — rather than some other file, or nothing at all — will
    actually arrive.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2480/1*t3XuYvxlgGhVlSqnhlUqSA.jpeg"
    alt="An e-book consultant"><em>An e-book consultant</em></p><p>Auditing software
    is hard! The most-heavily scrutinized smart contract in history had a small bug
    that nobody noticed — that is, until someone did notice it, and used it to steal
    fifty million dollars. If cryptocurrency enthusiasts putting together a $150m
    investment fund can’t properly audit the software, how confident are you in your
    e-book audit? Perhaps you would rather write your own counteroffer software contract,
    in case this e-book author has hidden a recursion bug in their version to drain
    your ethereum wallet of all your life savings?</p><p>It’s a complicated way to
    buy a book! It’s not <em>trustless</em>, you’re trusting in the software (and
    your ability to defend yourself in a software-driven world), instead of trusting
    other people.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4000/1*c91sjFxUObps_glZBLkMhw.jpeg"
    alt="“I’d rather look at the source code to make sure he didn’t vote twice.”"><em>“I’d
    rather look at the source code to make sure he didn’t vote twice.”</em></p><p>Another
    example: the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20180313084043/https://qz.com/1227050/sierra-leone-elections-powered-by-blockchain/">purported
    advantages</a> for a voting system in a weakly-governed country. “Keep your voting
    records in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone” <em>sounds</em> right
    — yet is your Afghan villager going to download the blockchain from a broadcast
    node and decrypt the Merkle root from his Linux command line to independently
    verify that his vote has been counted? Or will he rely on the mobile app of a
    trusted third party — like the nonprofit or open-source consortium <a href="https://qz.com/1234268/sierra-leone-blockchain-election-election-commission-denies-use-of-blockchain/">administering
    the election</a> or providing the software?</p><p>These sound like stupid examples
    — novelists and villagers hiring e-bodyguard hackers to protect them from malicious
    customers and nonprofits whose clever smart-contracts might steal their money
    and votes?? — until you realize that’s actually <em>the point</em>. Instead of
    relying on trust or regulation, in the blockchain world, individuals are <em>on-purpose</em>
    responsible for their own security precautions. And if the software they use is
    malicious or buggy, they should have read the software more carefully.</p><h3>The
    entire worldview underlying blockchain is wrong</h3><p>You actually see it over
    and over again. Blockchain systems are supposed to be <em>more</em> trustworthy,
    but in fact they are <em>the least trustworthy systems in the world</em>. Today,
    in less than a decade, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/ten-years-in-nobody-has-come-up-with-a-use-case-for-blockchain-ee98c180100#75b9">three

    exactly does blockchain stop this guy from spraying pesticides?"><em>How exactly
    does blockchain stop this guy from spraying pesticides?</em></p><p>Blockchain
    systems do not magically make the data in them accurate or the people entering
    the data trustworthy, they merely enable you to audit whether it has been tampered
    with. A person who sprayed pesticides on a mango can still enter onto a blockchain
    system that the mangoes were organic. A corrupt government can create a blockchain
    system to count the votes and just allocate an extra million addresses to their
    cronies. An investment fund whose charter is written in software can still misallocate
    funds.</p><p>How then, is trust created?</p><p>In the case of buying an e-book,
    <em>even if you’re buying it with a smart contract,</em> instead of auditing the
    software you’ll rely on one of four things, each of them characteristics of the
    “old way”: either the author of the smart contract is someone you know of and
    trust, the seller of the e-book has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation">reputation
    to uphold</a>, you or friends of yours have bought e-books from this seller in
    the past successfully, or you’re just willing to hope that this person will deal
    fairly. In each case, <em>even</em> if the transaction is effectuated via a smart
    contract, in practice you’re relying on trust of a counterparty or middleman,
    not your self-protective right to audit the software, each man an island unto
    himself. The contract still works, but the fact that the promise is written in
    auditable software rather than government-enforced English makes it <em>less</em>
    transparent, not <em>more</em> transparent.</p><p>The same for the vote counting.
    Before blockchain can even get involved, you need to trust that voter registration
    is done fairly, that ballots are given only to eligible voters, that the votes
    are made anonymously rather than bought or intimidated, that the vote displayed
    by the balloting system is the same as the vote recorded, and that no extra votes
    are given to the political cronies to cast. Blockchain makes none of these problems
    easier and many of them harder—but more importantly, solving them in a blockchain
    context requires a set of awkward workarounds that undermine the core premise.
    So we know the entries are valid, let’s allow only trusted nonprofits to make
    entries—and you’re back at the good old “classic” ledger. In fact, if you look
    at <em>any</em> blockchain solution, inevitably you’ll find an awkward workaround
    to re-create trusted parties in a trustless world.</p><h3>A crypto-medieval system</h3><p>Yet
    absent these “old way” factors—supposing you actually attempted to rely on blockchain’s
    self-interest/self-protection to build a real system—you’d be in a real mess.</p><p><img

    fragile and far between — theft was rampant, safe banking was a fantasy, and personal
    security was at the point of the sword. This is what Somalia looks like now, and
    also, what it looks like to transact on the blockchain <em>in the ideal scenario</em>.</p><p>Somalia
    on purpose. That’s the vision. Nobody wants it!</p><p><em>Even the most die-hard
    crypto enthusiasts</em> prefer in practice to rely on trust rather than their
    own crypto-medieval systems. 93% of bitcoins are mined by managed consortiums,
    yet none of the consortiums use smart contracts to manage payouts. Instead, they<a
    href="https://slushpool.com/home/"> promise</a> things like a “long history of
    stable and accurate payouts.” Sounds like a trustworthy middleman!</p><p><img

    cards and cocaine.</em></p><p>Same with Silk Road, a cryptocurrency-driven online
    drug bazaar. The key to Silk Road wasn’t the bitcoins (that was just to evade
    government detection), it was the <em>reputation scores</em> that allowed people
    to trust criminals. And the reputation scores weren’t tracked on a tamper-proof
    blockchain, they were tracked by a trusted middleman!</p><p>If Ripple, Silk Road,
    Slush Pool, and the DAO all prefer “old way” systems of creating and enforcing
    trust, it’s no wonder that the outside world had not adopted trustless systems
    either!</p><h3>In the name of all blockchain stands for, it’s time to abandon
    blockchain</h3><p>A decentralized, tamper-proof repository sounds like a great
    way to audit where your mango comes from, how fresh it is, and whether it has
    been sprayed with pesticides or not. But actually, laws on food labeling, nonprofit
    or government inspectors, an independent, trusted free press, empowered workers
    who trust whistleblower protections, credible grocery stores, your local nonprofit
    farmer’s market, and so on, do a way better job. People who actually care about
    food safety do not adopt blockchain because <em>trusted is better than trustless.
    *Blockchain’s technology mess exposes its metaphor mess — a software engineer
    pointing out that storing the data a sequence of small hashed files won’t get
    the mango-pickers to accurately report whether they sprayed pesticides is *also</em>
    pointing out why peer-to-peer interaction with no regulations, norms, middlemen,
    or trusted parties is actually a bad way to empower people.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4096/1*eMT-ntdZqu1H6-ZJTyfYfQ.jpeg"

    the farmer’s market or the organic labeling standard, so many <em>real</em> ideas
    are hiding in plain sight. Do you wish there was a type of financial institution
    that was secure and well-regulated in all the traditional ways, but also has the
    integrity of being people-powered? A credit union’s members elect its directors,
    and the transaction-processing revenue is divided up among the members. Move your
    money! Prefer a deflationary monetary policy? Central bankers are appointed by
    elected leaders. Want to make elections more secure and democratic? Help write
    open source voting software, go out and register voters, or volunteer as an election
    observer here or abroad! Wish there was a trusted e-book delivery service that
    charged lower transaction fees and distributed more of the earnings to the authors?
    You can <em>already</em> consider stated payout rates when you buy music or books,

  :title: Why the Future Belongs to Polymaths
  :content: '<p>The Expert Generalist: Why the Future Belongs to Polymaths</p><p>Some
    of history’s greatest contributions have come from polymaths.</p><p>Aristotle
    practically invented half a dozen fields of study across philosophy. Galileo was
    as much a physicist as he was an engineer when he helped kick-start the scientific
    revolution. Da Vinci might have been even more famous as an inventor than an artist
    if his notebooks were ever published.</p><p>Even in the last 100 years, we have
    had people like John Von Neumann and Herbert Simon who have made breakthrough
    advances across fields as diverse as computer science, economics, and psychology.</p><p>That
    is, of course, not to detract from the specialists who have pushed our progress
    forward. In fact, until now, these specialists have far outnumbered the polymaths
    in both their historical ranks and their contributions.</p><p>After all, it takes
    a lot of time to master the depths of a specific field so that you can eventually
    add something that pushes it ahead. From this point of view, it makes sense that
    polymaths have been as scarce as they have been.</p><p>Still, it’s clear that
    whenever we have had giants like Aristotle, Galileo, and da Vinci, the contributions
    they made even in specialized fields may not have been made in the same way if
    they hadn’t attacked a problem with a diverse inventory of mental knowledge and
    understanding.</p><p>Polymaths see the world differently. They make connections
    that are otherwise ignored, and they have the advantage of a unique perspective.</p><p>In
    a world increasingly dominated by machines, I have a feeling that this approach
    is going to become increasingly valuable.</p><h2>The Redundancy of Reality</h2><p>One
    of the reasons Aristotle created so many sub-fields of philosophy and early forms
    of science is because these fields were so young back then.</p><p>They were branches
    of the same underlying tree trunk, and Aristotle had a deep enough understanding
    of what was contained in that trunk to then divide it into different parts and
    make his early contributions.</p><p>Even so, however, the questions he asked and
    the answers he provided are still up for debate, and he is still a highly influential
    figure in philosophy. He didn’t just collect all of the low-hanging fruit, but
    he went the full length in developing the path that lay ahead.</p><p>The lesson
    here extends beyond philosophy. Reality is categorized in our mind by words. That’s
    how specialization is born. We move from a general observation through our senses
    and then we divide this observation into specializations like philosophy, psychology,
    economics, and art.</p><p>The tree trunk is reality, and the branches are the
    different disciplines, which then become their own trunks of knowledge with branches.</p><p>What
    polymaths realize by studying the different branches is that many of them have
    the same foundation, and if this foundation is deeply understood then all they
    need to do is apply that ingrained knowledge to a different context rather than
    do the work of surface-level specialization.</p><p>For example, as a writer, if
    I want my work read, I need to know marketing.</p><p>I’ve been fortunate and done
    relatively well for myself in the time I’ve been active, and yet I don’t read
    marketing books, and nor do I spend all that much time trying to formally learn
    about it. Why is that?</p><p>Well, because I’ve always had a deep fascination
    with psychology, and to me, marketing is just psychology dressed up in a particular
    context. Psychology is the trunk, and it’s a trunk I’ve thought about a lot, and
    as a result, I can already see the patterns that most people think of as marketing
    tactics.</p><p>Reality is redundant, and when you learn widely, that becomes clearer
    and clearer. The more you explore, the more you can exploit these redundancies.</p><h2>A
    Higher Rate of Learning</h2><p>The big difference between the approaches of a
    polymath and a specialist is that the specialist picks a spot and then goes deep,
    whereas the polymath is on a lane that continuously gets wider.</p><p>These are
    obviously not mutually exclusive, and the ideal combination to me is one that
    relies on a strong understanding of the fundamentals of many disciplines with
    a specific domain or two in which you specialize.</p><p>That said, if we take
    just a specialist and a polymath separately, beyond just the benefit of the creative
    connections that are available from having studied broadly, the polymath also
    has a learning advantage.</p><p>Learning itself is a skill, and when you exercise
    that skill across domains, you get specialized as a learner in a way that someone
    who goes deep doesn’t.</p><p>You learn how to learn by continuously challenging
    yourself to grasp concepts of a broad variety. This ironically then allows you
    to specialize in something else faster if you so choose. This is an incredibly
    valuable advantage.</p><p>It explains how some of history’s polymaths were able
    to contribute in such a specialized way even though they were primarily focused
    on going broad.</p><p>Now, in a world where Artificial Narrow Intelligence systems
    are going to displace most routine, specialized work, it isn’t too much of stretch
    to assume that this skill of learning to learn across disciplines may just be
    the difference between those who reinvent themselves and those who don’t.</p><p>In
    fact, chances are that our current distinctions between disciplines will start
    to fade away and new ones will arise. Many of them will likely reside between
    areas that aren’t currently covered by specialization.</p><p>Traditionally, the
    idea of having a single career over the course of a life wasn’t unreasonable.
    The future, however, looks different. People will likely have multiple careers
    that differ significantly. Even if they don’t, we will see more and more project-based
    work, which will require similar skills.</p><p>In such a world, the learning ability
    of a polymath may just be the difference.</p><h2>The Takeaway</h2><p>At any point
    in history, most of our knowledge is contained outside of individual minds. It’s
    contained in the cultures that spring up around us.</p><p>A big part of today’s
    culture is the internet. It’s not only democratized knowledge, but it’s made it
    so accessible that those who are curious enough can’t help but embrace the approach
    of a polymath. As such, we’re going to see more and more people playing at the
    intersection of different disciplines.</p><p>While specialization will still have
    its place, the boundaries between the many aspects of reality are going to continue
    to be blurred, and those who can comfortably embrace such blurring will thrive.</p><p>Although
    this may appear to many as unfamiliar, the truth is that it’s actually a far more
    accurate representation of what is going on. We’ve just been conditioned to think
    otherwise.</p><p>As Leonardo da Vinci would remind himself,</p><blockquote><p>“Study
    the science of art. Study the art of science. Develop your senses — especially
    learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.”</p></blockquote><p>What
    makes the world interesting is the interaction between objects and not the objects
    in and of themselves. If we’re always restricting these interactions by creating
    boundaries, we’re also taking away from our comprehension.</p><p>Nothing exists
    independently of its surroundings and that fact doesn’t change just because we
    decide to be blind to it with narrowed disciplines.</p><p>In an evolving world,
    those who can see that will have the edge.</p><h2>Want more?</h2><p>I write about
    philosophy, science, art, and history for a private community of smart, curious

  :title: The Future is Without Apps
  :content: '<p>The Future is Without Apps</p><h3>How we may soon no longer need to
    install apps with help from Google and Surprisingly: Apple.</h3><p>“There’s an
    App for That.”</p><p>It’s the trademarked slogan that defined the mobile world
    since 2008. Surely, apps seemed to be <em>the way</em> to go. Coding bootcamps
    that claimed to teach you app development chops within weeks popped up everywhere;
    products used commercials to go out of their way and show off their new apps;
    heck, even that family restaurant around the block got its own menu app built.</p><p>With
    the release of the App store in 2008, Apple was the first to popularize the idea
    of nicely packaged, downloadable applications on your phone. However, this concept
    of centralized software distribution isn’t actually new. <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/App_store#/Precursors">Many
    handheld and desktop devices</a> already had some form of application store built
    in years before Apple’s App Store debut. The reason why Apple succeeded, in retrospect,
    is a combination of timing and technology. By 2008, the iOS (then “iPhone OS”)
    platform was able to offer access to a maturing 3G network, a well-documented
    development environment, great handheld graphics, and most importantly, the backing
    of a technology giant. Mobile apps made sense. They were the most efficient way
    to deliver the newest content and services with native experience and performance.</p><p>People
    don’t care how it all works, they just want to throw birds at pigs and show off
    their #nofilter selfies. The ability to download and run cool apps was the iPhone’s
    winning feature for a short while. Android soon followed suit. Smartphones became
    cheaper; networks became faster; handheld processing power quadrupled; apps prevailed.</p><h3>“OK
    Sherlock, So What’s Wrong?”</h3><p>Nothing. But we can do better now. “Better
    than this <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/30/9641008/neko-atsume-english-version-available">app
    that lets me feed and play with cute cats</a>?” Yep.</p><p>You see, mobile apps
    succeeded because of the right combination of fast network and capable handheld
    processors. Technologies have progressed much further than that in the meantime,
    and the world of apps has grown beyond a healthy size. Among all of the headaches
    that follow the impenetrable mobile market today, the two most urgent would be
    the <strong>delivery</strong> and <strong>discoverability</strong> of content.</p><h3>Delivery
    and Discoverability</h3><p>Everyone with a smartphone has experienced this at
    some point: “Wow, this restaurant/shop is offering 20% off the special entree…oh,
    but only if you have this app,” or “Wait, I have to download an app for this?
    I just to want to see what my friend posted.” You probably heard from a friend
    or saw in a billboard about this really cool app that’ll transform your life,
    but hesitated to install it, or worse, pay for it.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*wtpwPbNmFyrSynO2WRAWqg.png"
    alt="Image by Branch Metrics"><em>Image by Branch Metrics</em></p><p>The problem
    is twofold. Let’s start with the first: <strong>delivery</strong>. Your average
    digital couch potato now has a shorter attention span and less patience. Paying
    for and installing an app, what was once a magical, fast, and smooth experience,
    is an act of commitment for many nowadays. You won’t believe how many people demand
    a convincing reason, your heartfelt speech, and your first-born child just to
    get them to try out a new app. Just think about that one friend who still refuses
    to download the Messenger app (seriously just get it already). Companies want
    to deliver content and services to customers as fast and easily as possible, but
    the increasing reluctance for the perceived installation-barrier is putting up
    a delivery obstacle. Our home screens are the new San Francisco — space is at
    a premium.</p><p>The second problem, <strong>discoverability</strong>, is a little
    bit more subtle, but was well articulated by a few tech journalists in the past.
    Many popular apps, such as Instagram and <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/203916/r-i-p-the-daily-the-worlds-first-ipad-only-newspaper/">The
    Daily</a>, began as mobile-only apps that surfaced great content only within a
    closed platform. You had to download and register for Instagram in order to see
    your friends’ Instagram photos. I’m sure that there are many more apps out there
    today that I’m not aware of with useful content that are not searchable or viewable
    on your browser. A fragmented Internet where creative and original content are
    locked up in proprietary platforms is not the Internet we know and love.</p><h3>App
    Linking and Indexing Works, But Not Good Enough</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*5IlwcFVs98EsCgGf-s2PMA.gif"
    alt="GIF by Branch Metrics"><em>GIF by Branch Metrics</em></p><p>Now that we understand
    the problems, let’s take a look at the current solutions. The word “app linking”
    may not sound familiar to you, but every time you tap on a YouTube link in another
    app and the YouTube app opens up to play the video, you’re experiencing it. Google,
    Apple, and Facebook have all implemented <a href="http://searchengineland.com/library/mobile-marketing/app-indexing-deep-links">variations
    of this technology</a>. App linking brings you to the app that best presents the
    content you want. Great.</p><p>The other half of our existing solution to compliment
    app linking is app indexing. Google and Apple have provided ways for third-party
    content providers to show their own in-app content in a search query, allowing
    previously locked away content to surface on Google and iOS Spotlight.</p><p>Perfect.
    That seems to have solved our delivery and discoverability problems. User searches
    for something, in-app content shows up in the results, user clicks the link and
    gets brought into the app.</p><p>You might have already noticed the problems here.
    What if the app doesn’t support app linking and indexing? App indexing requires
    the content provider to <em>actively put effort into implementing it,</em> so
    by default, your content is not visible to the world wide web, exactly opposite
    of how most web-based content work. And only until recently, in order for your
    app to be indexed by Google, developers had to build mirroring web versions. Just
    imagine the troubles. On the consumer side, what if I don’t have that app to begin
    with? What if I don’t want to install that app just to read an article? The list
    goes on.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Cxl8kKSztJhA4bggU01oGA.gif"
    alt="GIF by [Alex Bauer](http://stackoverflow.com/users/5394680/alex-bauer)"><em>GIF
    by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/5394680/alex-bauer">Alex Bauer</a></em></p><p>Think
    about that one time when you tried to check out something and it redirected you
    into App Store instead. Very annoying. And no, no one wants to install your app.</p><p>I
    don’t want to maintain a walled garden of apps. I want to consume and create content.</p><p>“So
    then, what is the solution?”</p><p>Just get rid of “apps.” Let’s see how we might
    be able to do this.</p><h3>App Streaming from Google</h3><p>Google’s approach
    to the delivery and discoverability problem has relied on app indexing and linking.
    If the developer puts in the effort, users can see previously mobile-only content
    surfacing on Google search results. This is great for Google to stay relevant
    in a mobile market that is increasingly reliant on native app content instead
    of web search. But in countries like China and India, where mobile phones are
    the first computers for millions of people and mobile-only content is king, where
    does a search engine provide their links to begin with? Suddenly, “everything
    is just a Google search away” loses its magic.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*YW3hlhA99S_A8sI4gB5aQw.gif"
    alt=""></p><p>Roughly four months ago, Google rolled out an impressive technology
    that almost no one remembers — App Streaming. It does exactly what it sounds like;
    instead of installing applications like we’re used to, you tap a link to the content
    and Google will stream the right parts of the app to you on-demand. No need to
    install it, ’cause you’re already running it. It might be Google’s first pilot
    experiment of their cloud platform, but the idea of streaming applications onto
    your phone is not new. In fact, the very technology itself was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/18/report-last-year-google-secretly-acquired-agawi-a-specialist-in-streaming-native-mobile-apps/">bought
    by Google from Agawi</a> a few years back.</p><p>Combine App Streaming and App
    Indexing, suddenly you remove the two barriers to all information previously locked
    away in mobile apps.</p><h3>On-Demand Resources from Apple</h3><p>While Google’s
    fantastic solution is still in an experimental stage, Apple is nudging its developers
    in more or less the same direction, albeit characteristic of Apple, in a less
    obvious or more incremental way.</p><p>On-Demand Resources (ODR) is a technology
    released with iOS 9 that downloads a small core application only on installation,
    and then downloads extra parts and content as needed. ODR currently is being used
    mostly in games, where a user only downloads the assets (graphics, videos, etc.)
    for a few beginning levels. iOS will then download more levels as the user progresses,
    and delete assets for completed levels to make space.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2700/1*fWCaF8-wYMy9_DHXBSC88g.png"
    alt="Image by [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/On_Demand_Resources_Guide/)"><em>Image
    by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/On_Demand_Resources_Guide/">Apple</a></em></p><p>How
    does this mirror Google’s approach? It doesn’t. However, if ODR becomes commonplace
    and the supporting infrastructure is flexible enough, you can reasonably imagine
    Apple extending the framework to a more general use case. In any case, they got
    this wonderful tool under the belt that will potentially blossom into a form of
    install-free applications.</p><h3>The Underrated Quest for Web Apps</h3><p>While
    we’re on Apple, I want to bring up Steve Jobs’s vision of the first iPhone. You
    might still remember fondly that the first iPhone was a closed platform with no
    developer environment or third-party apps. His solution? Web apps.</p><p>Web apps
    don’t need to be installed. They run (relatively) securely in closed browser environment.
    They are web friendly, meaning they can be indexed and surfaced by search engines.
    Oh wait, isn’t that exactly what we want today? Probably.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*JHfFeBBPtQj3JpO24IffvQ.jpeg"
    alt="This is probably the one billionth time you’ve seen this picture. But I’ll
    put it up anyways."><em>This is probably the one billionth time you’ve seen this
    picture. But I’ll put it up anyways.</em></p><p>I’m still leaning on the belief
    that web apps were simply Steve Jobs’s transitional plan to native apps, but even
    so, I think he was (at least accidentally) onto something. If we had in 2008 the
    powerful Javascript frameworks we have today, perhaps web apps would have taken
    off. Feel free to paint the story into one where Jobs the Visionary foresaw the
    discoverability and delivery problem, because perhaps he did predict this.</p><h3>A
    Future without Apps</h3><p>A lot of what app streaming offers competes with other
    sophisticated web app technologies (React Native, etc.) that are quickly closing
    the gap between native and web. However, one decisive differentiating factor would
    still be the native look and feel or possibly performance that web apps sorely
    lack. There is just no perfect solution yet.</p><p>On top of it all, what we really
    need is a <strong>platform-agnostic solution to app streaming that truly overcomes
    content delivery and discoverability problems</strong>. We want something akin
    to <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Java_applet">Java applets on browsers</a>
    (yikes) on mobile. Imagine the possibilities: regardless of the OS or the brand
    of supercomputer you have in your pocket, you will be able to run an app and view
    its content with zero friction and with native feel and performance. As for developers,
    you can write an app once and stream it to all devices and browsers.</p><p>With
    Google streaming apps to your phone and Apple nudging developers to store parts
    of their apps in the cloud, we may have just entered the beginning of a future
    where installation becomes obsolete and the border between “website” and “native
    app” is blurred. This is a future without apps. And it’s wonderful.</p><p>The
    user forefront of all these insanely complex, powerful, and cool technologies
    is one of ultimate simplicity and elegance.</p><p>Welcome to a future without
    apps.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed the post. To serve our readers better, Fwd: Thoughts

    from our data storage, processing, and analysis technology. In the past decade,

    in the early 1970s, where the relational database was born. At that time, query
    languages relied on complex mathematical logic and notation. Two newly minted
    PhDs, Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce, were impressed by the relational data
    model but saw that the query language would be a major bottleneck to adoption.
    They set out to design a new query language that would be (in their own words):

    of the success of the computer industry depends on developing a class of users
    other than trained computer specialists.</a>” They wanted a query language that
    was as easy to read as English, and that would also encompass database administration
    and manipulation.</p><p>The result was SQL, first introduced to the world in 1974.
    Over the next few decades, SQL would prove to be immensely popular. As relational
    databases like System R, Ingres, DB2, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL (and
    more) took over the software industry, SQL became established as the preeminent
    language for interacting with a database, and became the <em>lingua franca</em>
    for an increasingly crowded and competitive ecosystem.</p><p>(Sadly, Raymond Boyce
    never had a chance to witness SQL’s success. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_F._Boyce">He
    died of a brain aneurysm</a> 1 month after giving one of the earliest SQL presentations,
    just 26 years of age, leaving behind a wife and young daughter.)</p><p>For a while,
    it seemed like SQL had successfully fulfilled its mission. But then the Internet
    happened.</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/254441eea2ea320d7081c26599169d9e"

    and Boyce were developing SQL, what they didn’t realize is that a second group
    of engineers in California were working on another budding project that would
    later widely proliferate and threaten SQL’s existence. That project was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a>,
    and on October 29, 1969, <a href="http://all-that-is-interesting.com/internet-history">it
    was born</a>.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*L-W7e8jSXtgdWSXu."

    physicist who invented the Web (<a href="https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/">source</a>)</em></strong>*</p><p>Like
    a weed, the Internet and Web flourished, massively disrupting our world in countless
    ways, but for the data community it created one particular headache: new sources
    generating data at much higher volumes and velocities than before.</p><p>As the
    Internet continued to grow and grow, the software community found that the relational
    databases of that time couldn’t handle this new load. <em>There was a disturbance
    in the force, as if a million databases cried out and were suddenly overloaded.</em></p><p>Then
    two new Internet giants made breakthroughs, and developed their own distributed
    non-relational systems to help with this new onslaught of data: <strong>MapReduce</strong>
    (<a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf">published
    2004</a>) and <strong>Bigtable</strong> (<a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf">published
    2006</a>) by Google, and <strong>Dynamo</strong> (<a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">published
    2007</a>) by Amazon. These seminal papers led to even more non-relational databases,
    including <strong>Hadoop</strong> (based on the MapReduce paper, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop">2006</a>),
    <strong>Cassandra</strong> (heavily inspired by both the Bigtable and Dynamo papers,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra">2008</a>) and <strong>MongoDB</strong>
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB">2009</a>). Because these were
    new systems largely written from scratch, they also eschewed SQL, leading to the
    rise of the NoSQL movement.</p><p>And boy did the software developer community
    eat up NoSQL, embracing it arguably much more broadly than the original Google/Amazon
    authors intended. It’s easy to understand why: NoSQL was new and shiny; it promised
    scale and power; it seemed like the fast path to engineering success. But then
    the problems started appearing.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*G6Hx2C1l9abkVkxq."
    alt="***Classic software developer tempted by NoSQL. Don’t be this guy.***">*<strong><em>Classic
    software developer tempted by NoSQL. Don’t be this guy.</em></strong>*</p><p>Developers
    soon found that not having SQL was actually quite limiting. Each NoSQL database
    offered its own unique query language, which meant: more languages to learn (and
    to teach to your coworkers); increased difficulty in connecting these databases
    to applications, leading to tons of brittle glue code; a lack of a third party
    ecosystem, requiring companies to develop their own operational and visualization
    tools.</p><p>These NoSQL languages, being new, were also not fully developed.
    For example, there had been years of work in relational databases to add necessary
    features to SQL (e.g., JOINs); the immaturity of NoSQL languages meant more complexity
    was needed at the application level. The lack of JOINs also led to denormalization,
    which led to data bloat and rigidity.</p><p>Some NoSQL databases added their own
    “SQL-like” query languages, like Cassandra’s CQL. But this often made the problem
    worse. Using an interface that is <em>almost</em> identical to something more
    common actually created more mental friction: engineers didn’t know what was supported
    and what wasn’t.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*NxNoLnTnFQ7LkqBj."

    alt=""></p><p>Initially seduced by the dark side, the software community began
    to see the light and come back to SQL.</p><p>First came the SQL interfaces on
    top of Hadoop (and later, Spark), leading the industry to “back-cronym” NoSQL
    to “Not Only SQL” (yeah, nice try).</p><p>Then came the rise of NewSQL: new scalable
    databases that fully embraced SQL. <strong>H-Store</strong> <a href="http://hstore.cs.brown.edu/papers/hstore-demo.pdf">(published
    2008</a>) from MIT and Brown researchers was one of the first scale-out OLTP databases.
    Google again led the way for a geo-replicated SQL-interfaced database with their
    first <strong>Spanner</strong> paper <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf">(published
    2012</a>) (whose authors include the original MapReduce authors), followed by
    other pioneers like <strong>CockroachDB</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroach_Labs">2014</a>).</p><p>At
    the same time, the <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> community began to revive, adding
    critical improvements like a JSON datatype (2012), and a potpourri of new features
    in <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/New_in_postgres_10">PostgreSQL 10</a>:
    better native support for partitioning and replication, full text search support
    for JSON, and more (release slated for later this year). Other companies like

    fact, our journey developing <a href="https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb">**TimescaleDB</a>**
    closely mirrors the path the industry has taken. Early internal versions of <a
    href="http://www.timescale.com/">TimescaleDB</a> featured our own SQL-like query
    language called “ioQL.” Yes, we too were tempted by the dark side: building our
    own query language felt powerful. But while it seemed like the easy path, we soon
    realized that we’d have to do a lot more work: e.g., deciding syntax, building
    various connectors, educating users, etc. We also found ourselves constantly looking
    up the proper syntax to queries that we could already express in SQL, for a query
    language we had written ourselves!</p><p>One day we realized that building our
    own query language made no sense. That the key was to embrace SQL. And that was
    one of the best design decisions we have made. Immediately a whole new world opened
    up. Today, even though we are just a 5 month old database, our users can use us
    in production and get all kinds of wonderful things out of the box: visualization
    tools (Tableau), connectors to common ORMs, a variety of tooling and backup options,
    an abundance of tutorials and syntax explanations online, etc.<a href="https://blog.timescale.com/time-series-data-cassandra-vs-timescaledb-postgresql-7c2cc50a89ce"><strong>Eye

    our word for it. Take Google’s.</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*CiKNT6_V8VH5hRVoWNcIHA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Google has clearly been on the leading edge of data engineering
    and infrastructure for over a decade now. It behooves us to pay close attention
    to what they are doing.</p><p>Take a look at Google’s second major <strong>Spanner</strong>
    paper, released just four months ago (<a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46103.pdf">Spanner:
    Becoming a SQL System</a>, May 2017), and you’ll find that it bolsters our independent
    findings.</p><p>For example, Google began building on top of Bigtable, but then
    found that the lack of SQL created problems (emphasis in all quotes below ours):</p><blockquote><p>“While
    these systems provided some of the benefits of a database system, they lacked
    many traditional database features that application developers often rely on.
    <strong>A key example is a robust query language</strong>, meaning that developers
    had to write complex code to process and aggregate the data in their applications.
    <strong>As a result, we decided to turn Spanner into a full featured SQL system</strong>,
    with query execution tightly integrated with the other architectural features
    of Spanner (such as strong consistency and global replication).”</p></blockquote><p>Later
    in the paper they further capture the rationale for their transition from NoSQL
    to SQL:</p><blockquote><p>The original API of Spanner provided NoSQL methods for
    point lookups and range scans of individual and interleaved tables. While NoSQL
    methods provided a simple path to launching Spanner, and continue to be useful
    in simple retrieval scenarios, <strong>SQL has provided significant additional
    value in expressing more complex data access patterns and pushing computation
    to the data</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>The paper also describes how the adoption
    of SQL doesn’t stop at Spanner, but actually extends across the rest of Google,
    where multiple systems today share a common SQL dialect:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Spanner’s
    SQL engine shares a common SQL dialect, called “Standard SQL”, *<em>with several
    other systems at Google including internal systems such as F1 and Dremel (among
    others), and external systems such as BigQuery…*</em>For users within Google,
    this lowers the barrier of working across the systems.</strong> A developer or
    data analyst who writes SQL against a Spanner database can transfer their understanding
    of the language to Dremel without concern over subtle differences in syntax, NULL
    handling, etc.</p></blockquote><p>The success of this approach speaks for itself.
    Spanner is already the <em>“source of truth”</em> for major Google systems, including
    AdWords and Google Play, while <em>“Potential Cloud customers are overwhelmingly
    interested in using SQL.”</em></p><p>Considering that Google helped initiate the
    NoSQL movement in the first place, it is quite remarkable that it is embracing
    SQL today. (Leading some to recently wonder: “<a href="https://medium.com/@garyorenstein/did-google-send-the-big-data-industry-on-a-10-year-head-fake-9c94d553925a">Did
    Google Send the Big Data Industry on a 10 Year Head Fake?</a>”.)</p><h2>What this
    means for the future of data: SQL as the universal interface</h2><p>In computer
    networking, there is a concept called the “<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1.4614&rep=rep1&type=pdf">narrow
    waist</a>,” describing a universal interface.</p><p>This idea emerged to solve
    a key problem: On any given networked device, imagine a stack, with layers of
    hardware at the bottom and layers of software on top. There can exist a variety
    of networking hardware; similarly there can exist a variety of software and applications.
    One needs a way to ensure that no matter the hardware, the software can still
    connect to the network; and no matter the software, that the networking hardware
    knows how to handle the network requests.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*qm2HH4Ob3YnH3C3f."
    alt="***IP as the Networking Universal Interface ([source](http://slideplayer.com/slide/7597601/))***">*<strong><em>IP
    as the Networking Universal Interface (<a href="http://slideplayer.com/slide/7597601/">source</a>)</em></strong>*</p><p>In
    networking, the role of the universal interface is played by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">Internet
    Protocol (IP)</a>, acting as a connecting layer between lower-level networking
    protocols designed for local-area network, and higher-level application and transport
    protocols. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXumm52oBMo">Here’s one nice
    explanation</a>.) And (in a broad oversimplification), this universal interface
    became the <em>lingua franca</em> for computers, enabling networks to interconnect,
    devices to communicate, and this “network of networks” to grow into today’s rich
    and varied Internet.</p><p><strong>We believe that SQL has become the universal
    interface for data analysis.</strong></p><p>We live in an era where data is becoming
    “the world’s most valuable resource” (<a href="https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721656-data-economy-demands-new-approach-antitrust-rules-worlds-most-valuable-resource">The
    Economist, May 2017</a>). As a result, we have seen a Cambrian explosion of specialized
    databases (OLAP, time-series, document, graph, etc.), data processing tools (Hadoop,
    Spark, Flink), data buses (Kafka, RabbitMQ), etc. We also have more applications
    that need to rely on this data infrastructure, whether third-party data visualization
    tools (Tableau, Grafana, PowerBI, Superset), web frameworks (Rails, Django) or
    custom-built data-driven applications.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*iC7lwedryNOSSYiQc3M7-Q.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Like networking we have a complex stack, with infrastructure on
    the bottom and applications on top. Typically, we end up writing a lot of glue
    code to make this stack work. But glue code can be brittle: it needs to be maintained
    and tended to.</p><p>What we need is an interface that allows pieces of this stack
    to communicate with one another. Ideally something already standardized in the
    industry. Something that would allow us to swap in/out various layers with minimal
    friction.</p><p>That is the power of SQL. Like IP, SQL is a universal interface.</p><p>But
    SQL is in fact much more than IP. Because data also gets analyzed by humans. And
    true to the purpose that SQL’s creators initially assigned to it, SQL is readable.</p><p>Is
    SQL perfect? No, but it is the language that most of us in the community know.
    And while there are already engineers out there working on a more natural language
    oriented interface, what will those systems then connect to? SQL.</p><p>So there
    is another layer at the very top of the stack. And that layer is us.</p><h2>SQL
    is Back</h2><p>SQL is back. Not just because writing glue code to kludge together
    NoSQL tools is annoying. Not just because retraining workforces to learn a myriad
    of new languages is hard. Not just because standards can be a good thing.</p><p>But
    also because the world is filled with data. It surrounds us, binds us. At first,
    we relied on our human senses and sensory nervous systems to process it. Now our
    software and hardware systems are also getting smart enough to help us. And as
    we collect more and more data to make better sense of our world, the complexity
    of our systems to store, process, analyze, and visualize that data will only continue
    to grow as well.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*0NbRxZrtmccWwYJ_."

    with Fereshteh Forough, founder and president of Afghanistan’s Code to Inspire</h3><p>Born
    in 1985 in Iran as an Afghan refugee, Fereshteh Forough spent her early years
    traversing borders and exploring how computer science could help solve global
    problems, especially for women. Forough is the founder of <a href="http://codetoinspire.org/">Code
    to Inspire</a>, a nonprofit coding school for girls in Herat, Afghanistan that
    helps young women improve their technical literacy.</p><p>With three-year-old
    Code to Inspire, as well as her previous nonprofit, Digital Citizen Fund, Forough
    has explored using cryptocurrency to pay students and mentors as a way to guide
    them toward financial and social independence.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9600/1*t39Nr9yERaCsVGW1q6ZOjA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>At Coinbase, we’ve been fans of Forough’s work for a long time.
    We asked her to share her thoughts on how technology—and crypto specifically—is
    empowering young women in her home country.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9600/1*pbPeEpgBSgcWsuNq12u0GA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>“When I took the entrance exams for university [at Herat University
    in Afghanistan], I chose law, journalism, and economics. Two months later, I got
    the results: I had been placed in computer science. I was so upset!</p><p>One
    of the first days, there was an introduction to algorithm problem-solving and
    QBasic. I loved it. In my life, I face a lot of problems. On a computer, I can
    face problems and solve them. On the internet, you don’t need a passport. There
    are no geographical boundaries or limitations.”</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9600/1*_UNmpVh9dnn9t2WOd1O2lA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>“In early 2014, when I was working on my previous education nonprofit,
    a blogging-for-pay platform, I learned about cryptocurrency. We decided to do
    a pilot project sending bitcoin to our students, to see how it worked. We created
    wallets for the girls; all they needed was an email address. Sending money was
    fast, and there were almost no fees at all on transactions.</p><p>One of the main
    challenges I face in my work helping girls in Afghanistan is getting them paid
    for the work that they do. None of the girls have bank accounts — people in Afghanistan
    don’t really trust banks. Also to have a bank account, you need a lot of ID, which
    a decent amount of people in Afghanistan don’t have. And we don’t want to send
    the money to family members, because with a lot of these girls, their families
    just take their money. One thing that’s great about crypto with this community
    is its privacy.”</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9600/1*yg9Bto2_KGysUhJ912U6cw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>“In Afghanistan, women aren’t part of the conversation. They don’t
    have a platform to make decisions or raise their voices. With Code to Inspire
    I wanted a place for women to not be shy, to be creative, to do whatever they
    can’t do outside of their homes. Our students learn to code by taking on outsourcing
    projects like graphic design, mobile apps, and simple software development. We
    started with 50 girls in 2015, then added another 80 in 2016. We recently graduated
    our first 25 students, all high school girls.</p><p>I want to create a safe space
    where women feel welcome and accepted. I want them to have a way to make an income,
    the same way my mom learned how to make dresses when we were refugees in Iran.</p><p><img

    left Afghanistan because of my immigration status. I do Skype calls monthly with
    all the classes and the girls, so that can they see I’m an actual person. Every

    it’s been difficult to convince people in Afghanistan to take cryptocurrency instead
    of cash. We’d explain that this was currency over the Internet, but they didn’t
    believe us. They thought we were taking their money, or tricking them. We had
    to demonstrate that bitcoin could be useful. Students could come to us and we
    would convert their bitcoin into Afghanis. That’s how we proved to them that this
    was real currency. But for us, it didn’t feel safe to carry around that much cash
    all the time.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9600/1*S1Oz9HE8_A3kQg3p5CbxKg.png"

    crypto — students faced too many challenges when it came to accessing and spending
    it. That said, some of the teachers who work with our students earn ether (ETH)
    through work they do through a partnership with the Bounties Network, which allows
    people to accept ETH for fixing vulnerabilities for businesses.”</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9600/1*xT7IP1eJxQMGcc8w6RvfDQ.png"

    with good infrastructure.</p><p>This may sound crazy, but maybe the solution could
    come from one of our students. Maybe one of these girls could make a blockchain
    project, or a coin, or whatever, that could tackle that problem.”</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9600/1*IlJYVly03yNKtTncPuqXmg.png"

    took the programming community a couple of decades to appreciate Python. But since
    the early 2010’s, it has been booming — and eventually surpassing C, C#, Java
    and JavaScript in popularity.</p><p>But until when will that trend continue? When
    will Python eventually be replaced by other languages, and why?</p><p>Putting
    an exact expiry date on Python would be so much speculation, it might as well
    pass as Science-Fiction. Instead, I will assess the virtues that are boosting
    Python’s popularity right now, and the weak points that will break it in the future.</p><h2>What
    makes Python popular right now</h2><p>Python’s success is reflected in the <a
    href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=r%2Cpython%2Cjavascript%2Cjava%2Cc%2B%2B%2Cc%23">Stack
    Overflow trends</a>, which measure the count of tags in posts on the platform.
    Given the size of StackOverflow, this is quite a good indicator for language popularity.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*itIT95KvtxA1H2bcPcXtlA.png" alt="Snapshot
    of tags on various programming languages on StackOverflow."><em>Snapshot of tags
    on various programming languages on StackOverflow.</em></p><p>While R has been
    plateauing over the last few years, and many other languages are on a steady decline,
    Python’s growth seems unstoppable. Almost 14% of all StackOverflow questions are
    tagged “python”, and the trend is going up. And there are several reasons for
    that.</p><h3>It’s old</h3><p>Python has been around since the nineties. That doesn’t
    only mean that it has had plenty of time to grow. It has also acquired a large
    and supportive community.</p><p>So if you have any issue while you’re coding in
    Python, the odds are high that you’ll be able to solve it with a single Google
    search. Simply because somebody will have already encountered your problem and
    written something helpful about it.</p><h3>It’s beginner-friendly</h3><p>It’s
    not only the fact that it has been around for decades, giving programmers the
    time to make brilliant tutorials. More than that, the syntax of Python is very
    human-readable.</p><p>For a start, there’s no need to specify the data type. You
    just declare a variable; Python will understand from the context whether it’s
    an integer, a float value, a boolean or something else. This is a huge edge for
    beginners. If you’ve ever had to program in C++, you know how frustrating it is
    your program won’t compile because you swapped a float for an integer.</p><p>And
    if you’ve ever had to read Python and C++ code side-by-side, you’ll know how understandable
    Python is. Even though C++ was designed with English in mind, it’s a rather bumpy
    read compared to Python code.<a href="https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/learning-python-from-zero-to-hero-8ceed48486d5"><strong>Learning
    Python: From Zero to Hero</strong><em>A quick and comprehensive guide for your
    first steps in Python.</em>medium.com</a></p><h3>It’s versatile</h3><p>Since Python
    has been around for so long, developers have made a package for every purpose.
    These days, you can find a package for almost everything.</p><p>Want to crunch
    numbers, vectors and matrices? <strong>NumPy</strong> is your guy. Want to do
    calculations for tech and engineering? Use <strong>SciPy</strong>. Want to go
    big in data manipulation and analysis? Give <strong>Pandas</strong> a go.Want
    to start out with Artificial Intelligence? Why not use <strong>Scikit-Learn</strong>.</p><p>Whichever
    computational task you’re trying to manage, chances are that there is a Python
    package for it out there. This makes Python stay on top of recent developments,
    can be seen from the surge in Machine Learning over the past few years.</p><h2>Downsides
    of Python — and whether they’ll be fatal</h2><p>Based on the previous elaborations,
    you could imagine that Python will stay on top of sh*t for ages to come. But like
    every technology, Python has its weaknesses. I will go through the most important
    flaws, one by one, and assess whether these are fatal or not.</p><h3>Speed</h3><p>Python
    is slow. Like, really slow. On average, you’ll need about 2–10 times longer to
    complete a task with Python than with any other language.</p><p>There are <a href="https://hackernoon.com/why-is-python-so-slow-e5074b6fe55b">various
    reasons</a> for that. One of them is that it’s dynamically typed — remember that
    you don’t need to specify data types like in other languages. This means that
    a lot of memory needs to be used, because the program needs to reserve enough
    space for each variable that it works in any case. And lots of memory usage translates
    to lots of computing time.</p><p>Another reason is that Python can only execute
    one task at a time. This is a consequence of flexible datatypes — Python needs
    to make sure each variable has only one datatype, and parallel processes could
    mess that up.</p><p>In comparison, your average web browser can run a dozen different
    threads at once. And there are some other theories around, too.</p><p>But at the
    end of the day, none of the speed issues matter. Computers and servers have gotten
    so cheap that we’re talking about fractions of seconds. And the end user doesn’t
    really care whether their app loads in 0.001 or 0.01 seconds.<a href="https://medium.com/@trungluongquang/why-python-is-popular-despite-being-super-slow-83a8320412a9"><strong>Why
    Python is Popular Despite Being (Super) Slow</strong>*A beautiful explanation
    of the irrelevance of speed issues in Python by Bobby. *medium.com</a></p><h3>Scope</h3><p>Originally,
    Python was <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-and-dynamic-scoping/">dynamically
    scoped</a>. This basically means that, to evaluate an expression, a compiler first
    searches the current block and then successively all the calling functions.</p><p>The
    problem with dynamic scoping is that every expression needs to be tested in every
    possible context — which is tedious. That’s why most modern programming languages
    use static scoping.</p><p>Python tried to transition to static scoping, but <a
    href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-main-weaknesses-of-Python-as-a-programming-language">messed
    it up</a>. Usually, inner scopes — for example functions within functions — would
    be able to see <em>and</em> change outer scopes. In Python, inner scopes can only
    see outer scopes, but not change them. This leads to a lot of confusion.</p><h3>Lambdas</h3><p>Despite
    all of the flexibility within Python, the usage of Lambdas is rather restrictive.
    Lambdas can only be expressions in Python, and not be statements.</p><p>On the
    other hand, variable declarations and statements are always statements. This means
    that Lambdas cannot be used for them.</p><p>This distinction between expressions
    and statements is rather arbitrary, and doesn’t occur in other languages.</p><p><img

    Python, you use whitespaces and indentations to indicate different levels of code.
    This makes it optically appealing and intuitive to understand.</p><p>Other languages,
    for example C++, rely more on braces and semicolons. While this might not be visually
    appealing and beginner-friendly, it makes the code a lot more maintainable. For
    bigger projects, this is a lot more useful.</p><p>Newer languages like Haskell
    solve this problem: They rely on whitespaces, but offer an alternative syntax
    for those who wish to go without.</p><h3>Mobile Development</h3><p>As we’re witnessing
    the shift from desktop to smartphone, it’s clear that we need robust languages
    to build mobile software.</p><p>But not many mobile apps are being developed with
    Python. That doesn’t mean that it can’t be done — there is a Python package called
    Kivy for this purpose.</p><p>But Python wasn’t made with mobile in mind. So even
    though it might produce passable results for basic tasks, your best bet is to
    use a language that was created for mobile app development. Some widely used programming
    frameworks for mobile include React Native, Flutter, Iconic, and Cordova.</p><p>To
    be clear, laptops and desktop computers should be around for many years to come.
    But since mobile has long surpassed desktop traffic, it’s safe to say that learning
    Python is not enough to become a seasoned all-round developer.</p><h3>Runtime
    Errors</h3><p>A Python script isn’t compiled first and then executed. Instead,
    it compiles every time you execute it, so any coding error manifests itself at
    runtime. This leads to poor performance, time consumption, and the need for a
    lot of tests. Like, <em>a lot</em> of tests.</p><p>This is great for beginners
    since testing teaches them a lot. But for seasoned developers, having to debug
    a complex program in Python makes them go awry. This lack of performance is the
    biggest factor that sets a timestamp on Python.<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/top-7-modern-programming-language-to-learn-now-156863bd1eec"><strong>Top
    7 Modern programming languages to learn now</strong><em>How Rust, Go, Kotlin,
    TypeScript, Swift, Dart, Julia can boost your career and improve your software
    development skills</em>towardsdatascience.com</a></p><h2>What could replace Python
    in the future — and when</h2><p>There are a few new competitors on the market
    of programming languages:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rust</strong> offers the same
    kind of safety that Python has — no variable can accidentally be overwritten.
    But it solves the performance issue with the concept of ownership and borrowing.
    It is also the most-loved programming language of the last few years, according
    to <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology">StackOverflow
    Insights</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Go</strong> is great for beginners like Python.
    And it is so simple that it’s even easier to maintain the code. Fun point: Go
    developers are among the <a href="https://insights.dice.com/2019/10/30/top-programming-languages-that-will-get-you-paid/">highest-paid
    programmers</a> on the market.</p></li><li><p><strong>Julia</strong> is a very
    new language that competes head-on with Python. It fills the gap of large-scale
    technical computations: Usually, one would have used Python or Matlab, and patched
    the whole thing up with C++ libraries, which are necessary at a large scale. Now,
    one can use Julia instead of juggling with two languages.</p></li></ul><p>While
    there are other languages on the market, Rust, Go, and Julia are the ones that
    fix weak patches of Python. All of these languages excel in yet-to-come technologies,
    most notably in Artificial Intelligence. While their market share is still small,
    as reflected in the number of StackOverflow tags, the trend for all of them is
    clear: upwards.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ectt9Nl3dlnhGXKpHBmLuA.png"

    ubiquitous popularity of Python at the moment, it will surely take half a decade,
    maybe even a whole, for any of these new languages to replace it.</p><p>Which
    of the languages it will be — Rust, Go, Julia, or a new language of the future
    — is hard to say at this point. But given the performance issues that are fundamental
    in the architecture of Python, one will inevitably take its spot.</p>'

  :title: Be Prepared To Lose Your Job In The Future… If You Don’t Learn This One
    Skill Now
  :content: '<h3><strong>Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, and Elon Musk all take this one
    approach.</strong></h3><p>One question Jeff Bezos is often asked is one we all
    need to ask ourselves, “What’s going to change in the next 10 years?”</p><p>It’s
    a profound question because the world is changing so rapidly, and because the
    decisions we make now will determine our destiny.</p><p>Decide wrong, and you
    might find yourself on a sinking ship, watching as your whole industry goes bankrupt
    and the skills you spent years honing become obsolete. Millions of people from
    journalists to financial analysts now find themselves in this position.</p><p>Decide
    right, and you could be set for life. The top artificial intelligence programmers,
    for example, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-27/the-race-to-buy-the-human-brains-behind-deep-learning-machines">make
    as much as NFL superstars</a>. These programmers have suddenly found that the
    skill set they spent years honing has become incredibly valuable.</p><p>These
    two groups, top AI programmers and people whose skills have become devalued, might
    have spent the same amount of time learning and be equally smart. But selecting
    different fields took them down completely different paths.</p><p>Over the last
    few years, I’ve come across a group of people who have spent their whole careers
    expertly predicting the future, investing based off of their predictions, and
    then massively profiting decade after decade. What I’ve noticed is that they share
    a common and completely counterintuitive approach toward investing their money
    and time that bucks conventional wisdom. In this article, I’ll share how you can
    copy the approaches of self-made billionaire entrepreneurs and investors like
    Jeff Bezos, Ray Dalio, Howard Marks, and Warren Buffett so that you too can ‘win’
    your future.</p><h2><strong>“What’s Going to Change?” Is The Wrong Question</strong></h2><p>Like
    I said above, Jeff Bezos is often asked, “What’s going to change in the next 10
    years?” That’s actually <em>not</em> the key question though. Listen to how he
    reframes it (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p>That is a very interesting question;
    it’s a very common one. I almost never get the question:** ‘What’s NOT going to
    change in the next 10 years?’**And I submit to you that that second question is
    actually the more important of the two — because you can build a business strategy
    around the things that are stable in time.</p></blockquote><p>He then goes on
    to explain how Amazon has profited from focusing on the second question (emphasis
    mine):</p><blockquote><p>[I]n our retail business, we know that customers want
    low prices, and I know that’s going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast
    delivery; they want vast selection. It’s impossible to imagine a future 10 years
    from now where a customer comes up and says, ‘Jeff, I love Amazon; I just wish
    the prices were a little higher,’ [or] ‘I love Amazon; I just wish you’d deliver
    a little more slowly.’ Impossible.And so the effort we put into those things,
    spinning those things up, we know the energy we put into it today will still be
    paying off dividends for our customers 10 years from now. <strong>When you have
    something that you know is true, even over the long term, you can afford to put
    a lot of energy into it.</strong></p></blockquote><p>I remember the thoughts running
    through my head the first time I read this quote. It felt intuitive and counterintuitive
    at the same time. On the one hand, I thought to myself, “This makes so much sense!
    Why not just focus on what’s guaranteed to be valuable rather than speculating?”
    On the other hand, Bezos’ response flies in the face of conventional wisdom and
    was jarring. The typical approach to planning for the future resembles betting
    at the roulette wheel:</p><ul><li><p>Identify what you think is going to be really
    important (i.e., artificial intelligence, virtual reality, blockchain, synthetic
    biology, nanotechnology).</p></li><li><p>Pick one of those areas to invest in
    and master.</p></li><li><p>Hope it hits big and that you have the right timing
    so that you can profit.</p></li></ul><p>While the conventional approach does sometimes
    work, it’s not a dependable strategy. It’s not what I’d tell my kids to do. <a
    href="https://www.slideshare.net/kloeckner/kauffman-foundationventurecapital">A
    2012 study from the Kauffman Foundation</a> shows that “The [venture capital]
    industry hasn’t returned the cash invested since 1997.” And if you take out a
    few companies like Uber, Amazon, Google, and Facebook, the returns are abysmal.
    In other words, the odds of you investing in, starting, or being an early employee
    at a billion-dollar company are like the odds of winning a lottery. <a href="http://fortune.com/unicorns/">Just
    200</a> out of all the startups out there are valued at $1 billion or more right
    now! You have a tenfold <a href="http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml">better
    chance</a> of being hit by lightning.</p><p>Why doesn’t focusing on trends work
    as well as you might think?</p><h2><strong>Why Future Prediction Doesn’t Work</strong></h2><blockquote><h1><em>“You
    can’t predict, you can prepare.” — Howard Marks</em></h1></blockquote><p>Self-made
    billionaire, entrepreneur, and investor Howard Marks runs the investment firm
    Oaktree Capital and has $100 billion under management, making it one of the largest
    hedge funds in the world. Each year, Marks writes a widely-circulated letter to
    shareholders. <a href="https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2014-04-08-dare-to-be-great-ii.pdf?sfvrsn=2">One
    of these memos</a> gives a masterclass in how investing in future trends isn’t
    always smart:</p><ol><li><p>*<em>The seemingly sure bets will have the most competition,
    which will make them less profitable. *</em>Marks writes: “Most great investments
    begin in discomfort. The things most people feel good about — investments where
    the underlying premise is widely accepted, the recent performance has been positive
    and the outlook is rosy — are unlikely to be available at bargain prices. Rather,
    bargains are usually found among things that are controversial, that people are
    pessimistic about, and that have been performing badly of late.”</p></li><li><p>*<em>Luck
    and randomness are big, unavoidable factors. *</em>”It’s far from certain that
    even ‘right’ decisions will be successful, since every decision requires assumptions
    about what the future will look like, and even reasonable assumptions can be thwarted
    by the world’s randomness,” says Marks. There are certain random events that are
    so influential that they completely change the game for everyone. Nassim Taleb
    calls these events “Black Swans.” (A great example is the 2008 financial crisis.)</p></li><li><p>*<em>It’s
    much harder than you think to be consistently right. *</em>“It’s hard to consistently
    make decisions that correctly factor in all of the relevant facts and considerations
    (i.e., it’s hard to be right),” Marks notes with humility, a key trait of many
    of the world’s top-performing investors. Self-made billionaire Ray Dalio, the
    founder of the largest hedge fund in the world, drives home how hard investing
    is in the first sentence of his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1501124021/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=learningritua-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1501124021&linkId=af0e65d84a7073b923ceb97508da632c">new
    book</a>: “Before I begin telling you what I think, I want to establish that I’m
    a ‘dumb shit’ who doesn’t know much relative to what I need to know.”</p></li><li><p>*<em>Even
    if you get the prediction right, you are likely to get the timing wrong. *</em>Marks
    says: “Even well-founded decisions that eventually turn out to be right are unlikely
    to do so promptly. This is because not only are future events uncertain, their
    timing is particularly variable.” And the problem with this is that having the
    wrong timing is functionally equivalent to making the wrong decision.</p></li></ol><p>The
    field of artificial intelligence is a case in point for Marks’ argument. While
    artificial intelligence sounds like a sure bet now, it wasn’t always that way.
    From 1974–1980 and 1987–1993, the field went through “AI winters.” In these periods,
    AI reeled from being overhyped and lost credibility and funding. Talented young
    programmers left in droves. Many of the most successful people in the field now
    are those who survived these winters and kept going even when it didn’t seem smart
    to do so. Now, someone entering the AI field has to compete against droves of
    the smartest people in the world.</p><p>My point is that picking which fields
    will be hot in 20 years is not as simple as it sounds. Predicting third-, fourth-,
    and fifth-order consequences is almost impossible. Who would’ve predicted in the
    early 1900s that the invention of the automobile would ultimately lead to the
    creation of suburban sprawl, the hotel industry (because of the Interstate highway
    system), and the insurance industry.</p><p>Notice how Warren Buffett, the best
    investor in history, doesn’t invest in the hottest tech startups of the day. Instead,
    he has made his career by identifying businesses whose rock-solid fundamentals
    don’t change, or which change very slowly. As a result, Buffett is able to invest
    in companies for the long-term. He’s held stock in companies like Geico, Coca-Cola,
    and American Express for decades.</p><p>So if predicting the future isn’t the
    answer, what can you do instead?</p><h2><strong>Introducing The Trunk Technique</strong></h2><blockquote><h1><em>“Predicting
    rain doesn’t count. Building arks does.” — Warren Buffett</em></h1></blockquote><p>At
    the heart of the methods used by Buffett, Dalio, Marks, Taleb, and Bezos is a
    common theme: <em>focus on areas that are virtually guaranteed to be valuable
    in the future no matter what happens.</em></p><p>Bezos talks about how focusing
    on stable customer preferences is a powerful foundation to build a company around.
    I’d take that a step further: *<em>focusing on stable knowledge is a powerful
    approach to build a life around. *</em>I call this skill the Trunk Technique…</p><p>Some
    forms of knowledge arise quickly and then just as quickly become obsolete. Other
    forms stay relevant for a very long time. In my article, <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/why-being-great-is-so-much-harder-than-people-realize-c91616b18bc9">Why
    Being Great Is So Much Harder Than People Realize</a>, I share how the rate at
    which information goes obsolete is increasing:</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12069563">One
    academic study</a>, for example, found that the decay rate in the accuracy of
    clinical knowledge about cirrhosis and hepatitis was 45 years. In other words,
    if you’re talking to a 70-year-old liver specialist who hasn’t updated his skills,
    you have a 50 percent chance of getting bad information. Engineering degrees went
    from a half life of <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/an-engineering-career-only-a-young-persons-game">35
    years in 1930 to about 10 years in 1960</a>.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*-MERHx8ydAoVzvJy."
    alt="Source: New Scientist"><em>Source: New Scientist</em></p><p>So what’s the
    difference between knowledge that expires relatively quickly versus knowledge
    with staying power?</p><p>Broadly speaking, “transitional” or quickly-expiring
    knowledge is the kind that helps us navigate a specific environment (such as the
    specialized field of liver medicine). Whereas “pillar” or longer-lasting knowledge
    is based on fundamental principles and mental models that can be applied in many
    contexts including unforeseen future ones.</p><p>Let me explain. As I share in
    <a href="https://medium.com/@michaeldsimmons/how-elon-musk-learns-faster-and-better-than-everyone-else-a010a4f586ef">How
    Elon Musk Learns Faster and Better Than Everyone Else</a>, when most people think
    about knowledge, they think about it horizontally, viewing knowledge <em>across</em>
    different subjects. The problem with this is that when you look at things in one
    dimension, you miss important connections:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*fCIONUl-XEjJ4_Ha."
    alt=""></p><p>What many miss is that knowledge is vertical as well. Great thinkers
    and doers, I have noticed, view reality this way. There are <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-tell-if-someone-is-truly-smart-or-just-average-a2f0bcac5db2">deeper
    principles and mental models</a> that connect the various subjects that we study:</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*2VZX3PWb_it5QBUm." alt=""></p><p>In
    the example above, by learning the universal mental models of network science
    that apply to all networks, you can more easily understand specific patterns in
    how the brain functions and how social networks work.</p><p>And it’s not just
    one layer deep. There are many layers. In one of Elon Musk’s <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/">Reddit
    AMAs</a> he explains it like this:</p><blockquote><p>It is important to view knowledge
    as sort of a semantic tree — make sure you understand the fundamental principles,
    i.e. the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there
    is nothing for them to hang onto.</p></blockquote><p>Here’s one way of visualizing
    Musk’s semantic tree:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*dnkXKGQt26KIeKSA."
    alt=""></p><p>People who use the *<em>Trunk Technique *</em>focus on mastering
    the <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-tell-if-someone-is-truly-smart-or-just-average-a2f0bcac5db2">fundamental
    mental models or first principles</a> first and then move on to the leaves second.
    By doing this, they build a more stable and adaptable tree, and therefore career.
    Trees lose their leaves every winter, but they thrive for decades (and sometimes
    hundreds of years) because they have strong trunks and roots.</p><p>Let’s take
    the topic of experimentation as an example. Understanding the <a href="http://observer.com/2017/11/forget-10000-hours-edison-bezos-zuckerberg-follow-the-10000-experiment-rule/">10,000-experiment
    rule</a> is crucial for success at an individual, company, and societal level.
    The Leave Approach to getting better at experimentation would be to first focus
    on hacks like understanding how to A/B test a button on your website. The Trunk
    Technique would be to understand what the scientific method is first (i.e., controlled
    experimentation; peer-reviewed refereed journals; blind, randomized design; falsifiability;
    controlled placebo; double blind experimentation; computer simulations; and meta-analysis).
    By understanding the few core principles that make up the scientific method, one
    can then create thousands of experiments across every area of life and career
    forever. As new hacks and software tools arise, you’d be able to quickly understand
    their significance and use them. Then, when those specific tools become obsolete,
    you’d still have your trunk to grow new branches and leaves from. I attribute
    a large part of any success I’ve had as a writer to applying the scientific method
    to the creation of ideas.</p><p>Another example: I’m obsessed with health, so
    I’ve learned hacks for getting micronutrients, intermittent fasting, cold showers,
    saunas, and interval training. These are fine, but even more fundamental to my
    health has been learning the underlying principle of post-traumatic growth. All
    of the hacks above can be derived by understanding that systems grow by being
    stressed and then being given time to recover.</p><p>I share more details on how
    they specifically apply the Trunk Technique to your life in <a href="https://medium.com/@michaeldsimmons/how-elon-musk-learns-faster-and-better-than-everyone-else-a010a4f586ef">How

    To Tell If Someone Is Truly Smart Or Just Average</a>, which have collectively
    been read over 1 million times.</p><p>In summary, the Trunk Technique allows you
    to:</p><ul><li><p>*<em>Build a knowledge tree that lasts forever. *</em>Winston
    Churchill once said: “The farther back you can look, the farther forward you are
    likely to see.” More recently, this phenomenon has been called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy
    Effect</a>: “The future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology
    or an idea is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period
    of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy.” The corollary of this
    for the information age is: “The more you focus on fundamental knowledge, the
    longer your knowledge tree will last.”</p></li><li><p>*<em>Adapt to any future
    fast and thrive. *</em>The nature of f<a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-tell-if-someone-is-truly-smart-or-just-average-a2f0bcac5db2">undamental
    mental models</a> is that they appear across all fields. Therefore, when you go
    into an emerging field, you’ll enter with a head start, because you’ll immediately
    see how the principles you already know are relevant.</p></li><li><p>**Better
    understand what’s happening and what it means. <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/successful-people-are-not-necessarily-smarter-they-just-do-more-of-this-644a0cca6db8">**Similar
    to how an expert chess player can see several moves ahead</a>, mental models will
    allow you to put what’s happening in context so you can react appropriately and
    think farther ahead.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Reduce the risk of investing in an area
    that turns out to not be a winner. *</em>In this article, I’m not suggesting that
    you ignore the future completely. What I’m saying is that you balance your understanding
    of trends with what is never going to change: timeless principles and mental models.

    Nassim Taleb, a very successful investor rumored to be worth hundreds of millions
    of dollars, suggests an approach to investing resources that maximizes returns
    while eliminating losses*. *He calls it the Barbell Strategy: the idea of building
    a portfolio of extremes (extremely safe assets + high risk-reward assets) rather
    than building a big mix with everything in the middle.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*RRxbKLzk0Z-ubV3E."
    alt="Source: Nassim Taleb"><em>Source: Nassim Taleb</em></p><p>The Trunk Technique
    functions in the same way as Taleb’s Barbell Strategy. By building a strong base
    of risk-free knowledge, we cap our downside while also giving ourselves more flexibility
    and confidence to make speculative bets on the future that might hit it big. That’s
    why I argue that learning how to apply the Trunk Technique is one of the main
    skills that anyone should learn in order to create the future they want.</p><h2><strong>Want

  :title: 7 future web design trends
  :content: '<p>Too many articles will tell you what is cool in web design. I’m going
    to take you past the obvious to make some real predictions.</p><h2>1. Gestures
    are the new clicks</h2><p>We forget how hard scrolling webpages used to be. Most
    users would painstakingly move their mouse to the right edge of the screen, to
    use something ancient called a ‘scrollbar’:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*A4AZXGxmMSPgmoMzdmh98A.gif"
    alt=""></p><p>As a pro, you probably used a mouse wheel, cursor keys, or trackpad,
    but you were way ahead of most users.</p><p>In 2015 it’s far easier to scroll
    than it is to click. On mobile, you can scroll wildly with your thumb. To click
    on a precise target is actually <em>more</em> difficult — the complete opposite
    of what we’re used to on the desktop.</p><p>As a result, we should expect more
    and more websites to be built around scrolling first, and clicking second. And
    of course, that’s exactly what we’ve seen everywhere:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*u2PNhH9JnEi1iVfuEaYSig.gif"
    alt=""></p><p>There’s every reason to expect this trend to continue as mobile
    takes over more of the market. Modern sites have fewer things to click, and much
    more scrolling. We’ll see fewer links, more buttons, bigger ‘clickable’ areas,
    and taller pages that expect to be scrolled.</p><p>Websites which spread their
    articles onto multiple pages will soon learn this lesson. Expect these to turn
    into longer single pages or even, like TIME magazine, into infinite scrolling
    pages:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*xHMuAVLPuHzRRpcXk4CLHA.gif"
    alt=""></p><p>It’s too early to know if the web will expand itself onto devices
    like watches, but if it ever does, you can bet it’ll be almost entirely driven
    by gestures.</p><h2>2. The fold really is dead this time</h2><p>Now scrolling
    is so cheap, and devices are so varied in size, ‘the fold’ is finally becoming
    irrelevant.</p><p>Designers are increasingly free to not cram everything at the
    top of a page. This leads to a design trend popularised by <a href="http://medium.com/">Medium</a>
    — full-screen image titles, with no content visible until you start scrolling:</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*kDcO2lJRx7RcERXNZSgz8Q.png" alt=""></p><p>With
    tall, scrolling pages, designers have the chance to do what magazines have taken
    for granted for years: fill their pages with big beautiful images. In 2015 expect
    to see more designs that take up much more space — especially vertically — and
    a lot of larger imagery like this.</p><h2>3. Users are quicker, websites are simplifying</h2><p>Today
    every young adult is an expert web user. And even the amateurs are acting like
    pros: using multiple tabs, and swiping to go back a page.</p><p>The result is
    that everything is faster. And we’ve all learned to become impatient. If you want
    to make a mild mannered person explode with annoyance, just make their Internet
    really slow for a minute.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*21tR0tgN_MsHyc0Miu6C5w.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Now websites are forced not just to become faster (a technical problem),
    but to <em>become faster to understand</em>. Designs which slow the user down
    have the same impact on their audience as these websites which don’t load at all.</p><p>Simpler
    designs are easier to scan, which means they’re faster to appreciate. It’s easy
    to see which of these two designs is newer, and it’s because it’s the one that
    user’s can enjoy the fastest:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*Z7P_0dQGbOK5FrKFFT3kUQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*WLQYtRmsTB4B930C00PiOA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>This is the biggest reason for the death of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeuomorphic
    design</a>: users are more perceptive, less patient, and clutter only slows them
    down.</p><p>Apps put most websites to shame with super-minimal, beautiful interfaces.
    And they’re doing this because minimal interfaces perform better.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*mKDNeQHovb7w6mxEZNejtA.gif"
    alt=""></p><p>Flat design is just the beginning. The real trend is towards simplicity
    and immediacy, and we expect that to go further than ever in 2015.</p><h2>4. The
    pixel is dead</h2><p>On a desktop, a pixel was a pixel. You even had an idea of
    how many pixels made up an average inch: 72 dpi. Nowadays very few people know
    what a pixel is.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*tEM2lxZFmhMMsVUGmwNVqg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>With responsive design, we’ve seen a move towards grids and percentages.
    But one huge area remains still unchallenged: bitmap images.</p><p>Almost all
    of the web is built with images that have half the resolution of a modern display,
    and they don’t scale. With Retina displays and modern browsers, the time is right
    for vector images to become more popular in 2015.</p><p>We can see this trend
    already happening with the font-based icons and <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#">Google’s
    Material design</a>. The website loads faster and scale the icons to any size
    without losing quality. That makes them ideal for designers and modern web browsers.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*nxt4KgqsgbPRgMCDTGso1g.png" alt=""></p><p>The
    technology exists now, but it will take time for professionals to change their
    habits to create for higher quality displays. Once the average desktop display
    becomes Retina-grade (like the new iMac), we expect designers to follow suit.</p><h2>5.
    Animation is back</h2><p>If you want to make a website look dated, cover it with
    animated “Under Construction” GIFs and Flash animation. But several things are
    coming together to make animation a rising star in modern web design.</p><p><strong>Flat
    design</strong> can end up looking too consistent, boring even. Animation helps
    a website to stand out and to pack more information into less space.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*jj8v9rTM1IdgEn2JSRdnsQ.gif" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mobile
    apps</strong> have redefined what a user expects. Mobile apps use motion to convey
    meaning, and websites are just starting to do the same.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*lVlH7rVqFReYUfNWjwAUAQ.gif"
    alt=""></p><p><strong>New technologies</strong> like CSS animation make it easy
    to enhance designs without plugins, speed or compatibility issues. And Web Components
    (#6, below) will only accelerate this.</p><p><strong>GIF animation</strong> is
    back, and surprisingly effective. You’ll notice this article makes extensive use
    of GIF animation (if it doesn’t, you should view <a href="http://delighten.co.uk/?p=1596">this
    version</a>), which has never been easier to create or share.</p><h2>6. Components
    are the new frameworks</h2><p>Web technology continues to get more complicated,
    and less semantic. Designers must embed messy code onto their pages for simple
    tasks, like including Google Analytics or a Facebook Like button. It would be
    a lot easier if we could just write something like this instead:</p><p><google-analytics
    key=”UA-12345–678"></p><p>And we can with <a href="http://webcomponents.org/">Web
    Components</a>, which aren’t <em>quite</em> ready to be used by most designers
    yet. 2015 is looking like their year.</p><p><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/design/">Google’s
    Material design</a> is here, and it may just be what gets this movement started.
    Powered by <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/">Polymer</a>, and supported
    by all modern browsers, it provides the rich animation and interaction components
    from Android apps, with simple tags like these:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*KWMW6OwkMN9KCOD52mqMaQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>If that takes hold, it wouldn’t be surprising to see more component
    based frameworks appear in 2015. Perhaps Bootstrap 4.0?</p><h2>7. Social saturation
    and the rise of direct email</h2><p>Social media has been a huge success for consumers,
    but many content producers aren’t so happy.</p><p>The problem is saturation. With
    billions of posts every day, Facebook learns the posts that users are most likely
    to enjoy and shows only those. Unfortunately that means over time, what you post
    is increasingly seen by a smaller percentage of your followers. (A problem you
    can solve, conveniently, by paying Facebook).</p><p>Social isn’t going away, but
    in 2014 we’ve seen a lot of prominent bloggers like <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/">Tim
    Ferriss</a> move their focus away from social and into good old fashioned email
    lists. They’ve realised that email has one significant advantage over social:
    a much higher percentage of people will see what you send them.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*4vjtpm2BMWb9VCgD16fccg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>I expect this post-social trend to continue into 2015, with the
    under-appreciated trend of Web Notifications (which work much like notifications
    in a mobile app).</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*x-EAYYROaSMIOZzi8DOpaQ.gif"
    alt=""></p><h2>Bonus non-prediction: CSS shapes</h2><p>This cool technology <em>won’t</em>
    get noticed, except by designers. <a href="http://webplatform.adobe.com/shapes/">CSS
    shapes</a> allow you to flow layout into shapes, like circles:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*LPJ7lqbVCYWhOHEbFUYIfw.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>It’s incredibly cool, but until browser support is guaranteed, this
    is likely to be too risky to put time and effort into it you’d need almost two
    complete designs, for old and new browsers. And outside of designers, we don’t
    think many users would notice.</p><p>It <em>is</em> really cool though.</p><h2>What
    to expect in 2015</h2><p>In 2014 we saw <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/">mobile
    use overtake desktop</a>, but the general public hasn’t caught up. Most organisations
    still commission a website to look good on their computer first and work on mobile
    second.</p><p>In 2015 that strategy is likely to look out of touch and unprofessional.
    As the mobile becomes the main device for browsing the web, “mobile-first” will
    become less of a buzzword and more of a requirement.</p><p>Flat design may be
    everywhere, but when you look beyond ghost buttons the real trend is that <em>simpler
    sites are faster at gratifying users</em>.</p><p>Simplicity is not just a fashion:
    it’s the future. Expect it to only continue.</p><p>It will become more and more
    common to embed animation into blog posts, and for motion to signify both premium
    quality (for those who can afford it) and to support the user experience.</p><p>Pixels
    and the fold will slowly be set aside making more room for scrolling and click-second
    experiences. Web Components will make it easier to deliver app-like experiences
    in our websites.</p><p>Right now you see the best of mobile app design appearing
    in web design. With enough time, the difference between an app and a website might
    almost entirely disappear.</p>'

  :title: Why I owned a Macbook Pro for a day — and what it says to me about the future
    of Apple
  :content: <p>Not what I did to my Macbook, but certainly how I felt…</p><p><strong>On
    Saturday I bought a new Macbook Pro with touch bar. And on Sunday I returned it.</strong></p><p><em>The
    only surprising part of this is the fact I returned it so soon.</em></p><p>I was
    expecting to keep it for maybe a week. Certainly no more than the 14 day return
    period <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/apple">Apple</a> offer on all purchases.</p><p>You
    see, I never intended to keep this computer. I basically ‘abused’ their return
    policy whilst they repaired the second broken MBP I’ve had in a few months.</p><p>I
    don’t feel great about it, but I don’t feel too bad either considering my experience
    with Apple over the last nine months.</p><p>Ultimately the fault lies with them,
    their generally terrible customer service policies and a design/manufacturing
    fault with the late 2016 15&quot; Macbook Pro touch bar model. A fault that I’ve
    yet to see them publicly accept despite the fact it is accepted internally, has
    a fault code, and internet forums and youtube are full of people reporting the
    same problems.</p><p>Many of these people are being forced to pay out of their
    own pockets for expensive repairs even though there is, what seems to be a secret,
    repair programme in place.</p><p>Hopefully this article might help one or two
    people get what they deserve from Apple.</p><p><strong>The short version of this
    story is if you have a late 2016 15&quot; touch bar model and you have problems
    with noises or the screen, go to Apple and, unless you know you’ve done something
    stupid like dropped it or put a hammer through the screen, demand they fix it
    or replace it.</strong></p><p>The full version below is much longer and quite
    boring. But it’s here for public record and to get it off my chest more than anything
    else.</p><p>In December I bought a 15&quot; Macbook Pro with touch bar. I’d read
    the reviews. They were mixed. It was generally accepted that they were too expensive
    for what they are — even by Apple’s standards — and the switch to USB-C meant
    using dongles until the world catches up.</p><p>But I needed a new Macbook and
    it was the best option. I expected to be a bit disappointed in the cost/feature
    ratio department — and the dongle nonsense — but what I didn’t expect was 9 months
    of stress, arguing, character assassination, lost time and money.</p><p>It started
    badly with the computer making random noises. Creaking, squeaking, cracking —
    I never could decide the best way to describe it, maybe it was all three.</p><p>It
    would happen randomly. Sometimes when I wasn’t even touching it. Other times when
    I was typing and took my hands away from the side of the touchpad where they normally
    rest.</p><p>I also noticed a strange hollow metallic sound when I lightly tapped
    the side of the touchpad. I tried the same thing on other Macbooks in the house
    and they didn’t make the sound. I tried it on the same model in stores, and none
    of them made the sound.</p><p>I reported it to Apple but they dismissed it.</p><p><strong>Then
    things took a noticeable turn for the worse.</strong></p><p>I opened my Macbook
    one evening to find the screen black and what I thought was a bit of dirt or dust
    in the middle, just under the web cam.</p><p>I gently brushed it away — or tried
    to — but it wasn’t dust. It was a tiny crack. And brushing it — I can’t stress
    how lightly — caused it to crack right down and off to the center right of the
    screen.</p><p><strong>It was, to be as polite as I can under the circumstances,
    totally buggered.</strong></p><p>Now, what was interesting about this was although
    my laptop now had no working screen, amazingly all the creaks and squeaks and
    cracking noises had stopped.</p><p>A strange co-incidence some may say. Or proof
    that there was something wrong with the case and/or screen, as I believed.</p><p>I
    live in Malaga — although my <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/business">business</a>
    is in the UK and the laptop was bought in the UK — so I took it to the Marbella
    store. A good hour journey each way, plus a toll road — unless I want the journey
    to be even longer.</p><p>This is where things started to get nasty and Apple —
    who have been testing my patience for a few years — really did their best to get
    rid of a customer who has so many Macs listed on his account, plus lots of other
    Apple devices, that sometimes they get confused which one they are dealing with.</p><p>They
    immediately told me it was my fault. They claimed it had to be. They said once
    a screen leaves the factory, if it breaks, it is always the users fault.</p><p>I
    had a thin web cam cover on and they tried to claim that was the reason it broke.
    I suspected they might try that and it did cross my mind to take it off before
    showing it them, but I decided there was no need as it wasn’t the cause.</p><p>The
    company that makes the covers claimed to have never had a complaint about it and
    I’ve not found anything online about similar problems. A couple of Mac store workers
    told me quietly that it absolutely had nothing to do with it, but they weren’t
    the people making the decisions.</p><p><strong>I know for a fact I didn’t break
    the screen. I know the noises the case was making. And I know that once the screen
    had cracked the noises stopped.</strong></p><p>But Apple didn’t care. They continued
    to insist it was me who did it. They called me a liar.</p><p>Eventually — because
    I refused to give in — they offered to repair it as a one-off gesture. But I didn’t
    want a repair, I wanted a replacement. This was a new computer that had been faulty
    — I believed — since the day I got it. Why should I have a new computer repaired?
    And why should I go for up to 2 weeks without it? I do have older Macbooks lying
    around in various conditions but that’s not the point. I have this one for a reason.</p><p>During
    all this discussion one member of Apple staff actually told me ‘There’s the law,
    and then there’s Apple policy’ and he wasn’t talking about their policy being
    stronger than the law. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt at first —
    he’s Spanish and he was speaking a second language — but no, that is what he said
    and that’s what he meant.</p><p>No Apple. There is the law. That’s it.</p><p>Anything
    Apple want to do above that is great, but the law is the law.</p><p>I ended up
    going back to the Manchester store where I bought it. I was flying over from Spain
    anyway to get married at Manchester Town Hall.</p><p>We were only there a few
    days and I spent a number of hours, on the Saturday before I got married on the
    Sunday, ‘debating’ with the manager and several members of the Apple staff there.
    A couple of them were actually very good and supportive but overall it was a very
    stressful afternoon.</p><p>Eventually, when they finally realised I was serious
    and I wasn’t going to leave the store otherwise, they agreed to let me swap it
    for a new one. Actually, that’s what I thought they meant, but what they really
    meant was they would refund the near £3000 the laptop cost on to my card and let
    me buy another one. Of course, it would be a few days before the money from the
    refund was back in my account but …</p><p>So I bought another one there and then.
    I was pleasantly surprised to find they had the top spec model in-store (normally
    you have to order them) which I’d originally wanted but wasn’t available at the
    time, so I bought that. A faster CPU, faster graphics card, 1TB drive etc. So
    another £3,300 off my card and I finally left with a brand new Macbook Pro to
    replace the one with the broken screen. Oh, and my very-future wife bought an
    Apple Watch while she was waiting.</p><p>All that done, I could get on with getting
    married.</p><p><strong><em>That whole experience left me furious with Apple. But
    it was to get worse.</em></strong></p><p>The new one made the same noises. Actually,
    they were subtly different, but it made noises it shouldn’t.</p><p>As I’d just
    got married, and I’m generally always busy anyway, I didn’t get around to calling
    Apple about it for a while. I should have done. And I kept meaning to. I should
    have called them straight-away.</p><p>But then something else went wrong — the
    keyboard started playing up and some keys didn’t respond fully — which meant I
    had to call them so I reported the noises on the new one too.</p><p>Eventually
    I was passed on to a senior telephone advisor — a wonderful, friendly and knowledgable
    Scottish chap called Alasdair — who really listened to the problems I’d faced
    with the last one, all the stress I’d gone through, and asked me to send him a
    video of the noises this Macbook was making.</p><p>He passed it on to engineering
    in California. He’d heard some other reports of similar problems. He was the first
    to admit that to me. Everyone else up to now, both Marbella and Manchester, and
    telephone support, had said they had never heard of anyone having similar problems.</p><p>They
    only had to look at Mac forums or Youtube to see it being reported but that’s
    one thing I learned through this experience. Even senior advisors at Apple have
    very limited access to the internet at work, which doesn’t just show a shocking
    level of trust in their staff, but is a genuine hinderance to their ability to
    do their job. It’s less surprising they haven’t heard about problems from customers
    if they can’t read the forums their customers post on.</p><p>A few weeks later
    Alasdair got in touch. Apple HQ had accepted there was a fault with the late 2016
    15&quot; Macbook with touch bar that was causing the noises.</p><p>And the fix?</p><p><strong>A
    free screen replacement.</strong></p><p>I still don’t know exactly what the connection
    is between the screen and the case noises. Maybe the screen wasn’t set properly
    in the case? Maybe the case was putting pressure on the screen? I just don’t know,
    but — as I knew when my cracked screen caused my Macbook to stop making the noises
    — they are obviously linked.</p><p>Another trip to the Marbella store — which
    I was told I had to do and I couldn’t do over the phone even though the outcome
    was inevitable — resulted in them ordering the parts. Another afternoon gone,
    two more tolls paid.</p><p><strong>The guy I spoke to then knew about the problem
    immediately. He told me Apple stores around the world had been getting complaints
    for months. He told me that they’d known about it for a while but it’s a numbers
    game — until enough people complain, they’d deny it.</strong></p><p>I also had
    to put further pressure on Apple to agree to replace the keyboard at the same
    time but eventually they did agree.</p><p>Having just had a baby daughter, it’s
    taken a few weeks for me to get around to taking it in for repair after they got
    the parts in. I had to tell them I’d be delayed otherwise they would have used
    the parts for someone else and I’d have to start over again.</p><p>I still thought,
    and still think, I deserved a full replacement. This machine left the factory
    damaged. As did the one before. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect — for
    £3,300— a computer that hasn’t had to be repaired so soon because of a design
    or manufacturing fault.</p><p>But frankly after 9 months, I’m so tired of the
    arguments, and busy with my baby daughter, that I agreed to the repair.</p><p>Which
    takes me back to how this article started.</p><p>Apple, in their unquestionable
    wisdom, refuse to lend replacement computers when a machine has to go in for repair.
    I can understand this as a general policy, but sometimes — like maybe when you’ve
    had two laptops costing around 3k each in the space of 3 months, both faulty from
    the factory, countless trips to various stores, travel costs, petrol, toll roads,
    days off work, been called a liar etc — sometimes, you think they’d find a laptop
    to lend.</p><p>But no, they simply refuse.</p><p>Amazingly, a number of staff
    over the months suggested the solution I eventually used — to buy a new Macbook
    with the express intention of using it while mine was repaired and then return
    it under their 14 day returns policy. At one point I even considering buying everything
    I could afford just to mess with them. But I decided that was a tad childish.</p><p>When
    I took my Macbook in for repair on Saturday I was given the usual ‘up to 2 weeks’
    timescale for the repair. So I bought the replacement and copied my laptop over
    in the store before handing mine over. It took around two hours.</p><p>Then, yesterday,
    less than 24 hours later, I got an email saying my computer was ready for collection.
    It’s had a new screen put in and a new top case (including the keyboard). The
    bill — had they charged me — would have been just under 1000 euros.</p><p>So last
    night I went back and collected my repaired computer. Credit to Apple for repairing
    it so fast, perhaps someone read my case notes and realised that’s the least they
    could do.</p><p>And credit too to the staff member who processed the refund. They
    presumed I was returning it because it was a a Spanish keyboard (I gather that’s
    a common reason for British people to return them in Marbella), but I told him
    the truth. He agreed the no-loan policy is far from perfect and I had no problem
    getting a full refund.</p><p>But what an absolutely ridiculous position to be
    in. That computer — that I had for 24 hours — is now used. I don’t know what Apple
    do with them, but they can’t sell it for full price as new, because it’s not.</p><p><strong>Hey,
    here’s an idea. They could use it to lend to people who have computers in for
    repair…</strong></p><p>So, after 9 months of being treated like crap by a company
    I’ve (nearly) always loved, I now have — hopefully — a fully working Macbook Pro
    for the first time since December.</p><p>So far, no creaks or squeaks or cracking
    noises at all. And when I tap it, I get a nice solid thud, not the hollow metallic
    sound the last ones had (ok, I don’t need to tap it any more, that was just to
    show there was a problem…)</p><p>And the keyboard is working properly too.</p><p>Amazing.</p><p>Despite
    Alasdair’s great telephone support, and a couple of in-store staff, I’m afraid
    my view of Apple’s customer service in general is still poor.</p><p>I wouldn’t
    treat one of my customers like this, and my company doesn’t have a couple of hundred
    <strong>billion</strong> dollars of cash in the bank like Apple do.</p><p>They
    used to — or at least I seem to remember they used to — act like a prestige car
    company. Stupidly expensive, yes, but in return the dealer knows you by name and
    they treat you as more than just another faceless customer.</p><p>Sadly Apple
    seem to have stopped trying to be the Porsche or Ferrari of computers, while keeping
    the same prices — or, in the case of this Macbook range, actually putting the
    prices up — but decided to adopt the customer services policies of a dodgy used
    car lot.</p><p>And I’m not even going to start on the physical quality of the
    new machines. That’s a whole story in itself. Let’s just say they long passed
    the point of form over function and they need to remember a notebook is a portable
    device.</p><p>I hesitate to link the changes at Apple directly to the death of
    Steve Jobs. I admired him in many ways but I was never a fanboy of either him
    or Apple. But the change in Apple’s attitude does seem to co-incide with his death
    and Tim Cook’s leadership.</p><p>If I didn’t need certain applications I’d use
    Linux on a non-Apple laptop (I use it for servers already). And it’d take a lot
    to drag me back to Windows. So, for now at least, I feel I’m basically trapped
    into using Apple products (although the <a href="http://www.hackintosh.com/">Hackintosh</a>
    concept is interesting).</p><p>When you combine a feeling of being trapped into
    a product, with large price increases and appalling customer ‘service’, it’s very
    easy to lose long-term customers.</p><p>Not everyone hates Windows like I do,
    or needs certain apps like I do. And those are the customers who will soon be
    looking at the choices available and increasingly picking something other than
    a Macbook.</p><p>I hope I’m wrong. I don’t want to see Apple collapse again like
    it did the last time Jobs left the company. Especially as this time Jobs can never
    return.</p><p>It wouldn’t take that much to fix it. They have the cash to do it.
    They have the cash to do anything they want.</p><p>The fact they don’t suggests
    it’s either that the management don’t know what’s going on and don’t pay attention
    to their customers, or it’s a deliberate decision to treat customers like this.</p><p>Neither
    option is good for the long-term future of the company.</p><p>Apple, please, fix
    these basic problems. Hold your hands up when you make mistakes. Treat customers
    fairly. Apologise to them when you’ve mistreated them (you can even apologise
    for calling me a liar if you wish). Start putting yourself in the shoes of your
    customers before making rigid blanket policy decisions.</p><p>And, basically,
    just generally try to do the right thing. It’s not hard to work out what that
    is. All of you at Apple — even Tim Cook — are customers of many companies too.
    Think how you’d like to be treated and take it from there.</p><p>Damn it, I’ve
    just given away my planned business book for free. It was destined to be a best-seller.
    Oh well, here it is in full.</p><p><strong>Chapter 1. ‘How to run a business’
    — ‘Think like a customer’. The End.</strong></p><p>I’ve read about other people
    not putting up the same level of fight I did over this fault — and I don’t blame
    them — who have ended up paying Apple to ‘repair’ the damage ‘they’ did to their
    Macbook. If you’ve done that with this model, I urge you to go back and demand
    they return your money.</p><p>In the meantime, I’ll get back to work using my
    newly repaired Macbook — pleased it is fixed and working properly, but forever
    resentful of the last 9 months of stress and arguments, and dreading something
    else going wrong with it.</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/3c851dac986ab6dbb2d1aaa91205a8eb"

  :title: The 5 Things You Must Sacrifice To Have a Better Future
  :content: '<p>The 5 Things You Must Sacrifice To Have a Better Future</p><h2>1.
    Other People’s Definition of Success</h2><p>In the <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/5-things-i-had-to-give-up-to-be-successful-a7b076f3d859">words</a>
    of <a href="https://medium.com/u/ba6889ffc749?source=post_page-----cf7380c67979----------------------">Srinivas
    Rao</a>, host of The Unmistakable Creative podcast:</p><blockquote><p>“At some
    point, I realized that I had to give up other people’s definition of success.
    This is one of the most difficult things to give up because it is so deeply embedded
    in our cultural narratives that it becomes the standard by which we measure our
    lives. Even as entrepreneurs we have collectively agreed that fame and fortune
    are the markers of success.But, giving up other people’s definition of success
    is incredibly liberating and ultimately leads to the fullest expression of who
    you are and what matters to you. It’s not a one-time thing. It’s a daily habit
    of comparing less and creating more.”</p></blockquote><p>“Success” doesn’t just
    mean what the larger mob of society says it means: <em>lots of money, fame, and
    fortune</em>. Many people with fame, fortune, and money have terribly empty, imbalanced
    lives.</p><p><strong>Your success isn’t defined by what other people say.</strong></p><p>No
    one can define your success but you. If you continue to let others tell you what
    success is, you’ll never reach it. Even if you did, it wouldn’t be a true success,
    because it’s not what <em>you</em> really valued.</p><p>No, living an extraordinary
    life means defining your own version of what success is. You can begin to spend
    your time on what <em>really</em> matters to you.</p><ul><li><p>Do you *really
    *want 1,000,000 Twitter followers?</p></li><li><p>Do you <em>really</em> need
    to be in the Forbes 30 Under 30 list?</p></li><li><p>Do you <em>really</em> want
    to be a New York Times best-selling author?</p></li></ul><p>Or is your version
    of success more nuanced, more narrowed, more focused, more specific?</p><p>If
    you want to <a href="https://medium.com/@anthony_moore/living-an-extraordinary-life-means-giving-up-a-normal-one-31fd54738214">live
    an extraordinary life</a>, your definition of success must be your own. If we
    are always chasing what other people tell us to, we’ll never experience <em>true</em>
    success.</p><p>Let go of other people’s versions of success. Define your own success,
    and achieve it.</p><p>That is true success.</p><h2>2. Looking Good</h2><p>Here’s
    an old parable:</p><p><em>“Once upon a time, there was a wise Zen master. People
    traveled from far away to seek his help. In return, he would teach them and show
    them the way to enlightenment.</em></p><p><em>On this particular day, a scholar
    came to visit the master for advice. “I have come to ask you to teach me about
    Zen,” the scholar said.</em></p><p><em>Soon, it became obvious that the scholar
    was full of his own opinions and knowledge. He interrupted the master repeatedly
    with his own stories and failed to listen to what the master had to say. The master
    calmly suggested that they should have tea.</em></p><p><em>So the master poured
    his guest a cup. The cup was filled, yet he kept pouring until the cup overflowed
    onto the table, onto the floor, and finally onto the scholar’s robes. The scholar
    cried “Stop! The cup is full already. Can’t you see?”</em></p><p><em>“Exactly,”
    the Zen master replied with a smile. “You are like this cup — so full of ideas
    that nothing more will fit in. Come back to me with an empty cup.”</em></p><p>Most
    people believe they already have it all figured out, yet wonder why opportunities,
    luck, and success continues to elude them.</p><p>Choose to <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/if-you-dont-become-a-student-first-you-ll-never-be-great-at-anything-6560cc7e72d0">**become
    a student</a>** first, and success will find you.</p><p>If you want to look good
    — if you want everyone to think you have all the answers — then you’ll fooling
    all of them <em>and yourself</em>.</p><p>True success comes from knowledge, humility,
    and becoming a student of your craft. You can’t have that if you insist on looking
    like you have all the answers.</p><h2>3. Busyness</h2><blockquote><p>“The most
    successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.” -Jeff Goins, best-selling
    author</p></blockquote><p>How you spend your days is how you spend your life.</p><p>A
    lot of people love being “busy.” They wear it as a badge of honor. When you ask
    them how they’ve been, what’s the response? “<em>I’m so busy</em>,” they lament.
    But it’s a subtle brag. They <em>like</em> the feeling.</p><p>But when you’re
    busy, you don’t really do anything — just because your calendar is full of meetings,
    appointments, and commutes doesn’t mean you’re actually making any progress towards
    your true goals.</p><p>Are you focused, making tangible action steps towards what
    truly matters?</p><p>…Or are you just “busy?”</p><p>When you’re busy, you are
    on autopilot. You can’t see the hours slipping away, time you’ll never get back.</p><p>But
    when you choose to be focused — to spend your time and energy on achieving your
    true goals — that’s where the magic happens. That’s where focus turns into flow
    states, hyper-focused mental efforts to make fast progress.</p><p>Most people
    prefer the emotional boost of bragging about how “busy” they are, instead of actually
    doing the real hard work. Choose focus, not busyness.</p><h2>4. Entertainment
    and Distraction</h2><blockquote><p>“Successful people don’t see it as ‘free time.’
    They see it as the only time they have to do the things they really want to do
    in life and they don’t take a minute for granted.” -<a href="https://medium.com/u/7c10a61aa346?source=post_page-----ad0fd0aee03a----------------------">Nicolas
    Cole</a></p></blockquote><p>Reinvesting your free time is one of the most important
    ingredients to your success.</p><p>If you’re working a full-time job, with a commute
    and family and bills, you don’t have a lot of free time. If you’re like most people,
    the precious little free time you <em>do</em> have is spent on entertainment and
    distraction, not learning and growing.</p><p>This is low-level thinking, and it
    will lead you to a, frankly, low-level life.</p><p>But true success requires sacrifice.
    A common misconception many of those sleep-when-you’re-dead hustle-entrepreneurs
    claim is that you need be working all the time.</p><p>The truth is, you need to
    work your butt off — for a time. After you’ve spent the time creating your life,
    you can sit back and enjoy the work you’ve done.</p><p>I like aimless free time,
    and it’s important no matter who you are or where you’re at.</p><p>But if you
    want to make great strides and achieve a truly extraordinary life, you need to
    reinvest your free time into learning new skills, putting in the work, and being
    productive.</p><p>It won’t last forever. But you need to put in the time now,
    so later, you can have the life you want.</p><h2>5. “Kinda-Good” Opportunities</h2><p>You
    can do amazing things with your life — but only if you have the time to do them.</p><p>When
    my wife and I moved to South Korea for a year to teach English, my #1 goal was
    to become a full-time writer by the end of the 12 months.</p><p>During that year,
    I was offered several high-paying, interesting jobs:</p><ul><li><p>Youth basketball
    coach</p></li><li><p>Career coach</p></li><li><p>Private tutor</p></li><li><p>Remote
    data analyst</p></li><li><p>Musician for a church worship group</p></li></ul><p>But
    in the end, none of these kinda-cool opportunities would help me achieve my #1
    goal. On the contrary, they’d take up what little free time I had.</p><p>I said
    no to all of them. By the end of 12 months, I was making a full-time income as
    a writer. I had a signed book deal, tens of thousands of new followers, and I
    was getting hundreds of thousands of views each month.</p><p>There’s great power
    in saying no to kinda-good opportunities. There’s also great consequences if you
    spend all your time on the merely “good” opportunities — it means you won’t have
    time for the truly great ones when they come.</p><h2>In Conclusion</h2><p>Good
    things come from sacrifice.</p><p>If you want what you’ve never had, you must
    do what you’ve never done. It’s to start sacrificing the right things so you can
    have a better future.</p><p>Don’t let anyone define success but you. Stop being
    “busy,” and start being focused. Don’t worry about looking good, concentrate on
    learning all you can from everywhere you can. Spend your time wisely, because
    many things want your attention and energy. Make sure they’re the right things.</p><h2>Ready

    years from now you will arrive, the question is where</strong>?” — Jim Rohn</h1></blockquote><p>I
    remember this moment like it was yesterday. I’d just started writing. Finally,
    I found something that felt like an amazing fit — something I was willing to work
    hard at.</p><p>I was sitting in my room folding laundry watching a YouTube video
    by the late Jim Rohn and he talked about how much you could change your life in
    the span of five years.</p><p>Whether you wanted to start a business, build a
    brand, create an amazing network, start an organization, or any other venture
    that could radically transform your life, you could make it happen if you were
    willing to commit those five years.</p><p>I remember thinking to myself, “Five
    years doesn’t seem like a ton of time.” I silently committed to the timeframe.
    I wrote nearly every day, read books, watched videos, took courses, and essentially
    became an evolving self-improvement machine over that period.</p><p>As I moved
    forward, I kept seeing the same theme over and over again — five years. My favourite
    writer, James Altucher, said it takes <a href="https://jamesaltucher.com/blog/reinventing-yourself/">five
    years to fully reinvent yourself</a>. Jon Morrow, the online mentor who taught
    me most of what I know about blogging said that it would take <a href="https://smartblogger.com/website-traffic/">4
    to 6 years to build a blog that can create wealth</a>.</p><p>During years one
    through three when I was making little to no money, flailing around trying to
    figure out how to be a blogger, and bumping my head against the wall trying to
    learn all the little nuances that came along the way, I kept that number in my
    head. In years three to four, I could see that success was an inevitability. In
    years four to five, <em>everything skyrocketed.</em></p><p>I’ve reached my five-year
    anniversary as a writer and student of self-improvement. Here’s what I’ve accomplished:</p><ul><li><p>I’ve
    published three books</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2AOBK4zMLI&t=106s">I
    gave a TEDx talk</a></p></li><li><p>I grew my readership from zero to millions</p></li><li><p>I
    quit my job and became a full-time writer</p></li></ul><p>Being on the other side
    of the five-year equation, I can tell you without question that it works. You
    will experience exponential growth. In the beginning, you won’t be very good at
    the new skill you’re trying to learn or the path you’re trying to forge.</p><p>At
    this point, you’re just trying to *survive *and build good habits. Most people
    quit in this phase. Don’t be one of those people. Why? Because one day, you won’t
    just get a little better and become a little more successful, you’ll suddenly
    get much better and experience a ton more success.</p><p>Charlie Munger puts it
    well:</p><blockquote><p>‘Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were
    when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step by step you
    get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing
    for fast spurts… Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day, at the end of the
    day — if you live long enough — most people get what they deserve.’</p></blockquote><p>Here
    are some good rules of thumb for you:</p><ul><li><p>*<em>The 90-Day Sprint: *</em>Spend
    your first 90 days working on your new path, skill, or project, daily with reckless
    abandon. You will learn more about not only what it takes to succeed, but whether
    or not you actually like doing it, than any amount of “research” or “studying”
    will teach you. Most people don’t even make it this far. If you do, odds are you’ll
    keep going. In the event the path really doesn’t seem like a great fit, you didn’t
    waste that much time.</p></li><li><p>*<em>The Rule of 100: *</em>Be willing to
    do something 100 times to get good at it. Write 100 blog posts. Shoot 100 videos
    (something I recently accomplished with my new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMe1vAjk4e5z1hac7XqGP0A?view_as=subscriber">YouTube
    channel)</a>, record 100 podcasts, pitch 100 potential new clients.</p></li><li><p>*<em>18-Month
    Cycle: *</em>Peter Drucker, business expert and author of <em>Managing Oneself</em>,
    talks about using 18-month benchmarks to track your overall progress. The length
    of time is long enough to give you enough ‘data’ but not so long that you create
    unrealistic goals.</p></li><li><p>*<em>The One Thing: *</em><em>The One Thing</em>,
    by Gary Keller, teaches a simple rule to help you stay focused and productive.
    Ask yourself the question <em>“What’s the one thing you can do, such that by doing
    it, everything else will be easier or unnecessary?”</em> You can use this system
    to reverse engineer long-term goals into actionable goals and key performance
    indicators (KPIs) to work on in the short to intermediate-term. Choose your one
    thing for 18 months, then for the quarter, then for each month, then for each
    week, then for each day.</p></li></ul><p>I didn’t keep perfect track and progress
    of my career using all the systems above, but I did keep an intuitive sense of
    all of them while I focused on building my writing career to get where I am today.</p><p>Five
    years seems like a long time. It isn’t. When you break things down to the present
    moment and focus on the immediate future, you’ll look up five years later to see
    that you’ve achieved a level of progress even <em>you</em> didn’t think possible.</p><p>Your
    skills compound, like an investment account, and you’ll be orders of magnitude
    better than when you started. <strong>But you have to start</strong>.</p><p>I
    use this framework for every new goal or important decision. If I’m not willing
    to dedicate five years to it, I won’t do it. But when I do commit, I’m all the
    way in. And combining these five-year chunks leads to an insanely productive life.</p><p>You
    have that thing you want to do. You know what it is. You’re just scared.</p><p>You
    want to know whether or not it will work out beforehand. Trust me, if you have
    a decent amount of talent and enough work ethic to gradually get better over a
    period of five years, it’ll work. Now go.</p><p>*<em>Grab your free checklist

  :title: The future of the open internet — and our way of life — is in your hands
  :content: "<p>“魔術師” (The Mage) by Hsu Tung Han. 2013. Wood.</p><p>There are a lot
    of scary things happening these days, but here’s what keeps me up late at night.
    A handful of corporations are turning our open internet into this:</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ickvszselsWAGDvfIYYvww.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>These corporations want to lock down the internet and give us
    access to nothing more than a few walled gardens. They want to burn down the Library
    of Alexandria and replace it with a magazine rack.</p><p>Why? Because they’ll
    make more money that way.</p><p>This may sound like a conspiracy theory, but this
    process is moving forward at an alarming rate.</p><iframe src=\"https://medium.com/media/44654c44bc7779bf25f56ad6942d5b08\"
    frameborder=0></iframe><h3>History is repeating itself.</h3><p>So far, the story
    of the internet has followed the same tragic narrative that’s befallen other information
    technologies over the past 160 years:</p><ul><li><p>the telegram</p></li><li><p>the
    telephone</p></li><li><p>cinema</p></li><li><p>radio</p></li><li><p>television</p></li></ul><p>Each
    of these had roughly the same story arc:</p><ol><li><p>Inventors discovered the
    technology.</p></li><li><p>Hobbyists pioneered the applications of that technology,
    and popularized it.</p></li><li><p>Corporations took notice. They commercialized
    the technology, refined it, and scaled it.</p></li><li><p>Once the corporations
    were powerful enough, they tricked the government into helping them lock the technology
    down. They installed themselves as “natural monopolies.”</p></li><li><p>After
    a long period of stagnation, a new technology emerged to disrupt the old one.
    Sometimes this would dislodge the old monopoly. But sometimes it would only further
    solidify them.</p></li></ol><p>This loop has repeated itself so many times that
    Tim Wu — the Harvard law professor who coined the term “Net Neutrality” — has
    a name for it: <strong>The Cycle</strong>.</p><blockquote><h1>“History shows a
    typical progression of information technologies, from somebody’s hobby to somebody’s
    industry; from jury-rigged contraption to slick production marvel; from a freely
    accessible channel to one strictly controlled by a single corporation or cartel
    — from open to closed system.” — Tim Wu</h1></blockquote><p>And right now, we’re
    in step 4 the open internet’s narrative. We’re surrounded by monopolies.</p><p>The
    problem is that we’ve been in step 4 for decades now. And there’s no step 5 in
    sight. The creative destruction that the Economist Joseph Schumpeter first observed
    in the early 1900s has yet to materialize.</p><p>The internet, it seems, is special.
    It’s the ultimate information technology — capable of supplanting the telegram,
    telephone, radio, cinema, television, and much more — and there’s no clear way
    to disrupt it.</p><p>But the war for the commanding heights of the internet is
    far from over. There are many players on this global chess board. Governments.
    Telecom monopolies. Internet giants like Google and Facebook. NGOs. Startups.
    Hackers. And — most importantly — <strong>you</strong>.</p><p>The war for the
    open internet is the defining issue of our time. It’s a scramble for control of
    the very fabric of human communication. And human communication is all that separates
    us from the utopia that thousands of generations of our ancestors slowly marched
    us toward — or the Orwellian, Huxleyan, Kafkaesque dystopia that a locked-down
    internet would make possible.</p><p>By the end of this article, you’ll understand
    what’s happening, the market forces that are driving this, and how you can help
    stop it. We’ll talk about the brazen monopolies who maneuver to lock down the
    internet, the scrappy idealists who fight to keep it open, and the vast majority
    of people who are completely oblivious to this battle for the future.</p><p><strong>In
    Part 1, we’ll explore what the open internet is</strong> and delve into the history
    of the technological revolutions that preceded it.</p><p><strong>In Part 2, we’ll
    talk about the atoms.</strong> The physical infrastructure of the internet. The
    internet backbone. Communication satellites. The “last mile” of copper and fiber
    optic cables that provide broadband internet.</p><p><strong>In Part 3, we’ll talk
    about bits.</strong> The open, distributed nature of the internet and how it’s
    being cordoned off into walled gardens by some of the largest multinational corporations
    in the world.</p><p><strong>In Part 4, we’ll explore the implications of all this</strong>
    for consumers and for startups. You’ll see how you can help save the open internet.**
    **I’ll share some practical steps you can take as a citizen of the internet to
    do your part and keep it open.</p><p>This is a long read. So grab a hot beverage
    and get ready to download a massive corpus of technology history into your brain.</p><h2>Part
    1: What is the open internet?</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*RJiuB_tmmN2rWhuR0mzDGw.jpeg\"
    alt=\"“Number 31” by Jackson Pollock. 1950. Household paints on canvas.\"><em>“Number
    31” by Jackson Pollock. 1950. Household paints on canvas.</em></p><p>There’s only
    one word to describe the open internet: <strong>chaos</strong>.</p><p>The open
    internet is a cacophony of 3 billion voices screaming over one another. It’s a
    dusty, sprawling bazaar. And it’s messy. But it has produced some of the greatest
    art and industry of our time.</p><p>The open internet is a Miltonian marketplace
    of ideas, guided by a Smithian invisible hand of free-market capitalism.</p><p>The
    open internet is distributed. It’s owned in part by everyone and in whole by no
    one. It exists largely outside of the boundaries of governments. And it’s this
    way by design.</p><p>This reflects the wisdom of Vint Cerf, Bob Khan, J. C. R.
    Licklider, and all the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2mSyqHN\">wizards who stayed up
    late</a> and pioneered the internet. They had seen the anti-capitalist, corporatists
    fate that befell the telegram, the telephone, the radio, and the TV. They wanted
    no part of that for their invention.</p><p>The open internet is a <a href=\"http://www.nmqa.org/\">New
    Mexico Quilter’s Association</a>. It’s a <a href=\"http://www.jeremyleerenner.com/\">Jeremy
    Renner fan club</a>. It’s a North Carolina <a href=\"https://www.poetryslamasheville.com/\">poetry
    slam</a>. It’s a Washington D.C. <a href=\"http://www.hacdc.org/\">hackerspace</a>.
    It’s a <a href=\"http://www.townoftruckee.com/\">municipal website</a> for Truckee,
    California. It’s a <a href=\"http://www.b5-dark-mirror.co.uk/\">Babylon 5 fan
    fiction website</a>.</p><p>The open internet is a general purpose tool where anyone
    can publish content, and anyone can then consume that content. It is a Cambrian
    Explosion of ideas and of execution.</p><p>Can these websites survive in a top-down,
    command-and-control closed internet? Will they pay for “shelf space” on a cable
    TV-like list of packages? Will they pay for a slice of attention in crowded walled
    gardens?</p><h3>We’re all trapped in The Cycle</h3><p>Here’s a brief history of
    the information technologies that came before the internet, and how quickly corporations
    and governments consolidated them.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/0*eb27CiEc3orb0hk6.\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Originally anyone could string up some cable, then start tapping
    out Morse Code messages to their friends. The telegram was a fun tool that had
    some practical applications, too. Local businesses emerged around it.</p><p>That
    changed in 1851 when Western Union strung up transcontinental lines and built
    relay stations between them.</p><p>If small telegraph companies wanted to be able
    to compete, they needed access to Western Union’s network. Soon, they were squeezed
    out entirely.</p><p>At one point Western Union was so powerful that it was able
    to single-handedly install a US President. If you grew up in America, you may
    have memorized this president’s name as a child: Rutherford B. Hayes.</p><p>Not
    only did Western Union back Hayes’ campaign financially, it also used its unique
    position as the information backbone for espionage purposes. It was able to read
    telegrams from Hayes’ political opponents and make sure Hayes was always one step
    ahead.</p><p>Western Union’s dominance — and monopoly pricing — would last for
    decades until Alexander Graham Bell disrupted its business with his newly-invented
    telephone.</p><h3>How the telephone fell victim to The Cycle</h3><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*N-iK2nY4nfbenqfd.\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>After a period of party lines and local telephone companies, AT&amp;T
    — backed by JP Morgan — built a network of long-distance lines throughout America.</p><p>In
    order for the customers of local phone companies to be able to call people in
    other cities, those companies had to pay AT&amp;T for the privilege of using its
    long-distance network.</p><p>Theodore Vail — a benevolent monopolist if there
    ever was one — thought that full control of America’s phone systems was the best
    way to avoid messy, wasteful capitalistic competition. He argued that his way
    was better for consumers. And to be fair, it was. At least in the short run.</p><p>Vail
    was able to use AT&amp;T’s monopoly profits to subsidize the development of rural
    phone lines. This helped him rapidly connect all of America and unify it under
    a single standardized system.</p><p>But the problem with benevolent monopolists
    is they don’t live forever. Sooner or later, they are replaced by second-generation
    CEOs, who often lack any of their predecessors’ idealism. They are only after
    one thing — the capitalist’s prerogative — maximizing shareholder value. That
    means making a profit, dispersing dividends, and beating quarterly earnings projections.
    Which means extracting as much money from customers as possible.</p><p>AT&amp;T
    eventually squeezed out their competitors completely. And once AT&amp;T’s monopoly
    became apparent, the US Government took action to regulate it. But AT&amp;T was
    much smarter than its regulators, and jumped on an opportunity to become a state-sponsored
    “natural monopoly.”</p><p>AT&amp;T would enjoy monopoly profits for decades before
    being broken up by the FCC in 1982.</p><p>But the “baby bells” wouldn’t stay divided
    for long. In 1997, they were able to start <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/20/technology/att-merger-history/\">merging
    back together</a> into a corporation even bigger than before the break-up.</p><p>The
    end result is one of the most powerful corporations on the planet — strong enough
    to expand its monopoly from the land-line telephone industry to the emerging wireless
    telecom industry.</p><p>AT&amp;T functioned like a branch of government and had
    extensive research labs, but with one major exception — it could keep secret any
    inventions that it perceived as a threat to its core business.</p><p>Voicemail
    — and digital tape, which was later used as a critical data storage medium for
    computers — was actually invented within one of AT&amp;T’s labs in 1934. But they
    buried it. It was only re-invented decades later.</p><p>Imagine how much progress
    the field of information technology could have made during that length of time
    with such a reliable and high-volume data storage medium at its disposal.</p><p>To
    give you some idea of how much just this one AT&amp;T decision may have cost humanity,
    imagine that a corporation purposefully delayed the introduction of email by a
    decade. What would be the total impact on the productivity of society? How many
    trillions of dollars in lost economic activity would such an action cost us? This
    is <em>the</em> cautionary tale of what happens when you leave scientific research
    and development to private industry instead of public labs and universities.</p><p>You
    can still feel the legacy of AT&amp;T’s monopoly when you call an older person
    from out of state. They will instinctively try to keep the call as short as possible,
    because they want to avoid the massive long distance fees historically associated
    with such calls, even though these no longer apply.</p><p>I thought this was just
    my grandmother, but it’s everyone’s grandmother. Entire generations have been
    traumatized by AT&amp;T’s monopolistic pricing.</p><h3>How cinema fell victim
    of The Cycle</h3><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*bHNECUSCagertm4i.\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Shortly after the invention of cinema, we had thousands of movie
    theaters around the US showing a wide variety of independently-produced films
    on all manner of topics. Anyone could produce a film, then screen it at their
    local theater.</p><p>That changed when Adolf Zukor founded Paramount Pictures.
    He pioneered the practice of “block booking.” If small independent theaters wanted
    to screen, say, the newest Mae West film, they would also need to purchase and
    screen a bunch of other lessor films.</p><p>This took away theater owners’ status
    as local tastemakers, and removed their ability to cater to their own local demographics.
    The result was the commoditization of movie theaters, and ultimately the rise
    of blockbuster cinema.</p><h3>How radio fell victim to The Cycle</h3><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*3H32YV7o0zoTOzxv.\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Shortly after Marconi — <a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/inventions/who-invented-the-radio.htm\">or
    Tesla</a> — invented the radio, a massive hobbyist movement sprung up around it.
    There were thousands of local radio stations playing amateur programs.</p><p>In
    stepped David Sarnoff as the head of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). He
    was perhaps the most Machiavellian CEO of the 20th century.</p><p>At the time,
    RCA was making parts for radio. Conventional thinking at the time was that RCA
    should focus on hardware, and getting as many radio stations running and as many
    radios into homes as possible. But Sarnoff realized that the real money was in
    content. He helped popularize the National Broadcast Corporation (NBC) and focused
    instead on making money through advertisements.</p><p>Then Sarnoff approached
    the Federal Radio Commission — now the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
    — and convinced them that since the radio spectrum was a scarce commodity, they
    should carve it up and issue licenses.</p><p>Soon, NBC was available in every
    home, and the local hobbyist radio stations were squeezed off the air. RCA was
    now vertically integrated — from the parts in the radio stations, to the parts
    in consumer radios, to the content being broadcast itself.</p><p>Sarnoff had talked
    with the inventors of TV, and knew that it would eventually disrupt radio. But
    he had a plan. To claim the invention of television for himself.</p><h3>How TV
    fell victim to The Cycle</h3><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3154/0*enSdNSEgwUtJoHOq.\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>TV is different from other forms of technology here, in that it
    didn’t enjoy a hobbyist stage. With the help of the FCC, Sarnoff and RCA immediately
    locked TV down. The result was several decades where Americans had just three
    channels to choose from — NBC, CBS, and ABC.</p><p>This was the height of mass
    culture — half of all Americans watching the same episode of I Love Lucy at the
    same time. The popularity of television — combined with the lack of diversity
    in programming caused by this monopoly — had social and political consequences
    that haunt us to this day.</p><h3>Will the open internet fall victim to The Cycle?</h3><p>We’ve
    gone through the invention step. The infrastructure came out of DARPA and the
    World Wide Web itself came out of CERN.</p><p>We’ve gone through the hobbyist
    step. Everyone now knows what the internet is, and some of the amazing things
    it’s capable of.</p><p>We’ve gone through the commercialization step. Monopolies
    have emerged, refined, and scaled the internet.</p><p>But the question remains:
    can we break with the tragic history that has befallen all prior information empires?
    Can this time be different?</p><h2>Part 2: The War for Atoms</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*y4dWprGLwfpzXpY6TI8qPg.jpeg\"

    is indistinguishable from magic.” — Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law</h1></blockquote><p>As
    much as we may think of the internet as a placeless realm of pure abstractions,
    it has a physical structure. It’s not magic. And more people are waking up to
    this reality each day.</p><p>The internet is a series of copper and fiber optic
    cables that burrow through the ground and tunnel under oceans. We call this the
    Internet Backbone. Here’s what it looks like:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3196/1*2qNjZy6LDCur2mTbQyAulw.png\"

    workhorses of the internet: backbone providers</h3><p>Six major companies control
    the backbone, and they “hand off” traffic from one another without any money exchanging
    hands:</p><ul><li><p>Level 3 Communications</p></li><li><p>Telia Carrier</p></li><li><p>NTT</p></li><li><p>Cogent</p></li><li><p>GTT</p></li><li><p>Tata
    Communications.</p></li></ul><p>Within the US, the backbone is mostly controlled
    by old long distance carriers, including Verizon and AT&amp;T — who also control
    a two thirds of America’s $200 billion wireless industry.</p><p>These companies
    “peer” traffic through backbone connections controlled by other companies, or
    pay each other through “transit agreements.”</p><p>Despite the involvement of
    these huge telecoms, the internet backbone represents a fairly healthy market.
    <a href=\"http://www.stern.nyu.edu/networks/Economides_ECONOMICS_OF_THE_INTERNET_BACKBONE.pdf\">About
    40%</a> of the internet’s backbone is controlled by smaller networks you’ve never
    heard of.</p><h3>The mafia of the internet: the ISPs</h3><p>The broadband internet
    market, on the other hand, isn’t healthy at all. This is the “last mile” of cables
    that plug into the internet backbone. And it’s full of ugly tollbooths, guarded
    by thick benches of lawyers and lobbyists.</p><p>This broadband internet market
    is controlled by just three extremely powerful — and widely hated — internet service
    providers (ISPs):</p><ul><li><p>Cox</p></li><li><p>Charter (which recently acquired
    another ISP, Time Warner)</p></li><li><p>and <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/america-most-hated-companies-110032495.html\">the
    most hated corporation in America</a>, Comcast, which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/business/2015/01/comcast-now-has-more-than-half-of-all-us-broadband-customers/\">controls
    56%</a> of America’s broadband</p></li></ul><p>Another form of ISPs are the wireless
    providers:</p><ul><li><p>AT&amp;T</p></li><li><p>Verizon (formerly part of AT&amp;T)</p></li></ul><p>These
    two providers control 2/3rd of the wireless market. If you have a mobile phone,
    there’s a good chance you pay one of these companies every month for your data
    plan.</p><p>These ISPs control millions of miles of copper cables that they buried
    in the ground back in the 1970s, and satellites they shot up into orbit in the
    1990s. They constantly <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/29/7090107/comcast-settles-lawsuit-will-pay-50-million-settlement\">break</a>

    <a href=\"http://www.fiercecable.com/cable/cox-ordered-to-pay-6-31m-for-tying-set-top-fees-to-premium-video-services\">law</a>,
    tie up regulators in lengthy court battles, and make it practically impossible
    for anyone — even Google — to enter their markets.</p><p>The ISPs do all this
    for one reason and one reason alone: so they can avoid free market competition
    — and the expensive technology upgrades it would require — while they continue
    raking in their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rent\">monopoly
    rents</a> from the 2/3 of Americans who only have one choice in their neighborhood
    for broadband internet.</p><p>For the past two years, the public had a weapon
    against these ISPs. It’s not one that can mortally wound them , but it has helped
    beat back their monopolistic tendencies. It’s called Net Neutrality.</p><h3>How
    Net Neutrality works</h3><p>The story of ISPs basically comes down to this: They
    used to make a ton of money off of cable packages. But people discovered that
    once they had the internet, they didn’t care about cable TV any more — they just
    wanted data plans and so they could watch YouTube, Netflix, or whatever shows
    they wanted — and they could also consume a lot of non-video content, too.</p><p>The
    ISPs don’t make nearly as much selling you a data plan as they used to make selling
    you a cable plan, though. So their goal is to return to the “good old days” by
    locking down the internet into “channels” and “bundles” then forcing you to buy
    those.</p><p>How do we prevent this? The good news is that we already have. In
    2015, the FCC passed a law that regulated ISPs as utilities. This is based on
    the principle of “Net Neutrality” which basically states that all information
    passing through a network should be treated equally.</p><p>As part of its 2015
    decision on Net Neutrality, the FCC asked for public comment on this topic. 3
    million Americans wrote to the FCC. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/less-than-1-of-comments-sent-to-the-fcc-opposed-net-neutrality/\">Less
    than 1% of those people</a> were opposed to Net Neutrality.</p><p>After a hard
    fought battle against telecoms, we convinced the FCC to enshrine Net Neutrality
    into law.</p><p>The FCC’s Title II regulation created three “bright lines” that
    prevent ISPs from doing the following:</p><ol><li><p>Blocking content from websites</p></li><li><p>Slowing
    down content from websites</p></li><li><p>Accepting money from websites to speed
    up their content</p></li></ol><p>These rules made it so that no matter how rich
    and powerful a corporation is — and Apple and Google are the biggest corporations
    on Earth, and Microsoft and Facebook aren’t far behind — they can’t buy priority
    access to the internet.</p><p>Everyone has to compete on a level playing field.
    These tech conglomerates have to compete with the scrappy startups, the mom-and-pop
    businesses, and even independent bloggers who are running WordPress on their own
    domain.</p><p>Nobody is above Net Neutrality. It’s as simple a tool as possible
    for protecting the capitalist free market internet from monopolies who would otherwise
    abuse their power.</p><p>Now ISPs are treated like a utility. How are the packets
    being routed through a network different from the water being piped through the
    ground, or the electricity flowing through a power grid?</p><p>The water company
    shouldn’t care whether you’re turning on a tap to wash dishes or to take a shower.</p><p>The
    power company shouldn’t care whether you’re plugging in a TV or a toaster.</p><p>The
    ISPs shouldn’t care what data you want or what you use it for.</p><p>The reason
    ISPs want to get rid of Net Neutrality is simple: if we stop treating them like
    the utility that they are, they can find ways to charge a lot more money.</p><p>Here’s
    the former CEO of AT&amp;T laying out his evil plan:</p><blockquote><h1>“Now what
    they would like to do is use my pipes free, but I ain’t going to let them do that
    because we have spent this capital and we have to have a return on it. So there’s
    going to have to be some mechanism for these people who use these pipes to pay
    for the portion they’re using. Why should they be allowed to use my pipes? The
    Internet can’t be free in that sense, because we and the cable companies have
    made an investment and for a Google or Yahoo! or Vonage or anybody to expect to
    use these pipes [for] free is nuts!” — Edward Whitacre, AT&amp;T CEO</h1></blockquote><p>What
    he should certainly realize is that everyone is already paying for internet access.
    You’re paying to be able to access this article. I’m paying to push this article
    up onto the internet. This website is paying to send the traffic from its servers
    over to your computer.</p><p>We have all already paid to use these ISP’s last
    mile of cables. No one is using these pipes for free.</p><p>But the ISPs see an
    opportunity to double dip. They want to charge for bandwidth, and also charge
    websites what the Mafia calls “protection money.” They essentially want to be
    able to say to website owners: “Those are some lovely data packets you’ve got
    there. It sure would be a shame if they got lost on their way to your users.”</p><p>Of
    course, most of the open internet couldn’t afford to pay this “protection money”
    to ISPs, so the ISPs would block traffic to their websites, cutting consumers
    off from most of the open internet. But the ISPs wouldn’t need to block these
    websites. All the ISPs would need to do is introduce a slight latency.</p><p>Both
    Google and Microsoft have done research that shows that if you slow down a website
    by even 250 milliseconds — about how long it takes to blink your eyes — most people
    will abandon that website.</p><p>That’s right — speed isn’t a feature, it’s a
    basic prerequisite for attracting an audience. We humans are extremely impatient
    and becoming more so with each passing year.</p><p>This means that in practice,
    <strong>if an ISP artificially slows down a website, it’s practically as damaging
    as blocking the site entirely.</strong> Both of these acts result in the same
    outcome — a severe loss of traffic.</p><p>Traffic is the lifeblood of websites.
    Without traffic, merchandise doesn’t get sold. Services don’t get subscribed to.
    Donations don’t get made.</p><p>Without traffic, the open web dies — whether ISPs
    block it or not.</p><h3>The ISPs have launched an all-out assault on Net Neutrality</h3><p>With
    January’s change in US administration and the election of our 45th president,
    the FCC has changed as well.</p><p>The FCC Chairman Ajit Pai — a former Verizon
    lawyer — is now in control of the only regulator that the ISPs answer to. And
    here’s a direct quote from him:</p><blockquote><h1>“We need to fire up the weed
    whacker and remove those rules that are holding back investment, innovation and
    job creation.” — FCC Chairman Ajit Pai</h1></blockquote><p>The ISPs won’t reinvest
    their “protection money” in infrastructure. They already have incredible monopoly
    profits. Here’s their net income (after-tax profits) from 2016:</p><ul><li><p>AT&amp;T:
    $16 billion</p></li><li><p>Verizon: $13 billion</p></li><li><p>Comcast $8 billion</p></li><li><p>Charter
    $8 billion</p></li></ul><p>They have plenty of profit they could claw back into
    improving infrastructure. They’re choosing instead to disperse this money to shareholders.</p><p>In
    just two months, Chairman Pai has already done incredible damage to Net Neutrality.
    He dropped <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-rating\">Zero Rating</a>
    lawsuits against four monopolies who were in clear violation of Net Neutrality
    law. Now Comcast and AT&amp;T can continue to stream their own video services
    without them counting toward customers’ data caps, and there’s nothing the FCC
    will do about it.</p><p>Former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler did his best to reach
    out to Chairman Pai and convince him of the virtues of Net Neutrality. The two
    were scheduled to meet once every two weeks during Wheeler’s last 18 months in
    office. But Pai cancelled every single one of these meetings.</p><blockquote><h1>“You
    have to have open networks — permissionless innovation. Period. End of discussion.
    They’re crucial to the future.” — Former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler</h1></blockquote><h2>Part

    like? Look no further than the Apple App store.</p><p>There are two million apps
    in the app store, which shared a total of $28 billion in 2016. Apple takes a 30%
    commission on every sale, and made $8.4 billion from the app store alone.</p><p>Most
    of the remaining $20 billion goes to just a small handful of mobile gaming companies:</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3082/1*oPJzQBAc3TBR5tEeIT0qew.jpeg\"

    alt=\"\"></p><p>The minority who do bother to download new apps don’t end up downloading
    very many.</p><p>And all 8 of the top apps in the app store are <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/all-of-2016s-top-mobile-apps-are-owned-by-either-google-or-facebook-a9c56d77a74b\">owned
    by just two corporations</a>: Facebook and Google.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*z8oy_wsJPrdk1PRD.\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>A vast majority of the remaining 2 million apps get very little
    traffic — and even less money.</p><p>The Apple App Store isn’t a level playing
    field. It doesn’t resemble the open internet it was built on top of. Instead,
    it’s an example of a walled garden.</p><p>Walled gardens look beautiful. They’re
    home to the most popular flora. But make no mistake, you won’t be able to venture
    very far in any one direction without encountering a wall.</p><p>And every walled
    garden has a gatekeeper, who uproots plants that look like weeds. If you want
    to plant something in a walled garden, you have to get approval from that gatekeeper.
    And Apple is one of the most aggressive gatekeepers of all. It keeps out <a href=\"http://www.recode.net/2016/6/30/12067578/spotify-apple-app-store-rejection\">apps
    that compete with its own interests</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/technology/clearing-out-the-app-stores-government-censorship-made-easier.html\">censors
    apps that don’t mesh with its corporate worldview</a>.</p><h3>A brief history
    of walled gardens</h3><p>First there was the original walled garden of the internet,
    AOL.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*ZigvOTQyCrOX3S3j.\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>20 years later, AOL still has 2 million users paying them $20/month.
    There’s a lot of money to be made in building walled gardens and trapping users
    in them.</p><p>Then came Yahoo, which wasn’t a walled garden by design, but became
    one anyway because people were so new to the internet.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*SNypPuPL9TuPK1wU.\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>In the late 90s, startups raised money specifically so they could
    <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/yahoo.html\">buy banner ads on Yahoo</a>.
    It was the best way they could reach prospective users.</p><p>But Yahoo was a
    candle in the sun compared to the ultimate walled garden: Facebook.</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*r1hvO-OxGfgwBRHM.\" alt=\"\"></p><p>A
    quarter of the people on Earth use Facebook for an average of 50 minutes each
    day.</p><p>And those 50 million people connected to Internet.org that Mark Zuckerberg
    is bragging about? Those are people from extremely poor countries who were given
    a choice: they could either pay for the open internet or just get Facebook for
    free. They chose Facebook.</p><p>The insidiously-named Internet.org was famously
    <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/08/india-facebook-free-basics-net-neutrality-row\">rejected
    in India</a> — among other countries — where activists were able to raise awareness
    about all the things Indians would give up by accepting Facebook instead of the

    the open internet</a>. In his ravenous quest to expand Facebook’s market share,
    he’s even gone so far as to build a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/technology/facebook-censorship-tool-china.html\">sophisticated
    censorship tool</a> so that Facebook can appease the governments of countries
    where it’s currently blocked, like China.</p><p>And Facebook is just one of several
    internet corporations who stand to profit from these sort of closed-source, closed-data
    walled garden platforms.</p><p>Here are the 10 largest corporations in the world
    by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization\">market capitalization</a>:</p><ol><li><p>Apple
    Inc</p></li><li><p>Alphabet (Google)</p></li><li><p>Microsoft</p></li><li><p>Exxon

    Fargo</p></li><li><p>AT&amp;T</p></li></ol><p>All of them are American-based multinationals.
    5 out of 10 of them are internet companies, and one of them is an ISP.</p><p>Once
    you look past the last gasp of the banks and the oil companies, it becomes clear
    that these internet companies are the new order. They control information. They
    control the conversation. They control politics. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/11/facebook-won-trump-election-not-just-fake-news/\">Facebook
    won the new president the election</a> — <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/13/13619148/trump-facebook-twitter-helped-win\">even
    the president and his advisors acknowledge this</a>.</p><p>So what makes you think
    they won’t come to control the very internet they dominate?</p><p>Even as the
    costs of launching a website fall, the costs of reaching an audience continue
    to rise.</p><p><strong>Facebook and Google account for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/business/media-websites-battle-falteringad-revenue-and-traffic.html\">85%
    of all new dollars spent on online advertising</a></strong>. Everyone else — newspapers,
    blogs, video networks — is fighting for crumbs — the 15% that fell from Facebook’s
    and Google’s mouths.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/06/net_neutrality_missing/\">**Half
    of all internet traffic</a> now flows to just 30 websites. **The remaining half

    alt=\"\"></p><h3>We blindly trust tech founders to be benevolent</h3><p>You may
    think that the Mark Zuckerbergs and the Larry Pages of the world would know better
    than to abuse their power. But such scandals have happened in the past.</p><p>Reddit
    is one of the most popular websites on the internet. One of its founders recently
    put the company’s reputation in jeopardy. He admitted that he had <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/reddit-donald-trump-steve-huffman-spez-pizzagate-trolls-hillary-clinton-a7436406.html\">modified
    users’ comments in Reddit’s database</a> — essentially putting words in the mouths
    of people who were critical of him.</p><p>We are not only placing faith in the
    temperament of the elite handful of tech company founders. We’re also trusting
    that other actors — who ultimately take over these organizations — will be benevolent.
    Even when we know that their shareholders — or governments — can force them to
    be malevolent and do things that go against their users’ interests.</p><p>However
    you may feel about Mark Zuckerberg and his intentions, know this: Just like the
    “benevolent monopolist” Theodore Vail, who championed rural access to AT&amp;T
    in the early 20th century, Mark Zuckerberg will one day retire. And the person
    who takes over Facebook will not be nearly as forward thinking as he is. Most
    likely, it will be some finance guy or sales guy who will sell Facebook users
    — and their Exabytes of data — down the river.</p><h3>By destroying Net Neutrality,
    the ISP monopolies are herding us all into walled gardens</h3><p>If we lose net
    neutrality, websites that once freely operated on the open internet will face
    three choices:</p><ol><li><p>pay ISPs so that their customers can access their
    website</p></li><li><p>don’t pay ISPs, and plummet into obscurity</p></li><li><p>become
    part of a walled garden that is paying ISPs on their behalf</p></li></ol><p>This
    last option will be the most appealing for most small businesses. They will choose
    the free option. And in doing so, they’ll hand over to the walled gardens some
    amount of control over their own websites.</p><p>A Google or a Facebook will step
    in to help ensure that your customers are able to access your business’s website.
    These walled gardens will pay ISPs on your behalf, and help serve your content
    on their own domains. But in return, the walled garden could:</p><ul><li><p>inject
    ads into your website (probably ads for your competitors)</p></li><li><p>capture
    your data and sell it (probably to your competitors)</p></li><li><p>redirect your
    customers to the websites of competitors who are willing to pay for your audience</p></li></ul><p>Just
    like with Google ads or Facebook ads, the internet will become a race to see who
    can pay walled gardens the most money so they can gain access to customers. And
    most of this will be completely invisible to consumers.</p><p>There are precedents
    for all of this.</p><p>Facebook convinced millions of businesses to setup Facebook
    pages. The companies then spent their own money publicizing their Facebook pages
    and getting their customers to “like” their pages. Then Facebook pulled a bait-and-switch,
    and made it so these businesses would have to advertise through Facebook if they
    wanted to reach their own customers who’d previously liked their pages.</p><p>And
    here’s what happens when a small nonprofit like <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.com\">freeCodeCamp</a>
    refuses to pay for Google ads:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*I0Tn_NPPShIHduZhbqgE2A.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Companies with lots of money like this one — which is a subsidiary
    of Kaplan, one of the largest for-profit education conglomerates on earth — can
    pay money to Google so they can intercept our users.</p><p>And these ads will
    gradually look less and less like ads. Here’s how Google ads have changed over
    time to look more and more like normal search results:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*L16W9sX0YMGZ3DBXBbQFwg.png\"
    alt=\"[Image credit](http://searchengineland.com/search-ad-labeling-history-google-bing-254332)\"><em><a
    href=\"http://searchengineland.com/search-ad-labeling-history-google-bing-254332\">Image
    credit</a></em></p><p>Now that tiny, green-bordered box with the word “ad” in
    it is all that distinguishes an advertisement from a legitimate search result.
    It is perhaps unsurprising that 55% of Google users <a href=\"https://searchenginewatch.com/2016/08/11/55-dont-recognise-paid-ads-in-google-serps-stats/\">don’t
    even recognize the fact that these are ads</a>.</p><p>Eventually walled gardens
    may converge on something similar to Baidu, China’s largest search engine, which
    for a long time wasn’t labelling ads at all.</p><p>Baidu <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/04/world/asia/china-baidu-investigation-student-cancer.html\">got
    into trouble last year</a> after a college student used their search engine to
    seek treatment for a commonly treatable form of cancer. The student went to a
    hospital he found at the top of Baidu’s search results.</p><p>What the student
    didn’t know was that that hospital had paid Baidu money to be put at the top of
    the search results, and that this was in fact an advertisement. But Baidu had
    deliberately obscured this fact from their users so they could charge more for
    the ad.</p><p>The hospital proceeded to recommend an expensive and unproven drug
    instead of the standard — and far cheaper — treatment of surgery and chemotherapy.</p><p>After
    exhausting his family’s savings of $30,o00 on the ineffective treatment, the 21-year-old
    student wrote one final essay about his situation and how Baidu had lead him right
    into the hands of fraudsters. Then he died.</p><p>This is just a glimpse into
    the human toll that these walled gardens can inflict upon society. In a walled
    garden environment where only those who pay money get seen, consumers will face
    more misinformation, more fraud, and more needless suffering.</p><p>Instead of
    the equalizing force that was the open internet, the rich will get richer and
    the poor will get poorer. The internet’s promise of economic democratization will
    fall by the wayside, and we’ll enter yet another age of peasants living under
    feudal lords.</p><h3>In the future, our internet could become as locked-down as
    China’s</h3><p>China has the most sophisticated censorship tools in the world.
    So much so that other authoritarian regimes license the use of these tools to
    control their own populations.</p><p>1.4 billion Chinese people are trapped in
    a closed internet, behind the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_China\">Great
    Firewall of China</a>.</p><p>The anti-Net Neutrality agenda that the ISPs are
    pursuing would require them to use a technique called Deep Packet Inspection.
    Without looking inside the contents of every packet, it’s impossible for an ISP
    to decide which packets they want to selectively slow down.</p><p>This means that
    in addition to sending packets of data through their networks, ISPs would actually
    have to look inside each of these packets — and would quite likely record the
    contents of these packets. It would be expensive, but storing major chunks of
    the Zettabyte of information the internet generates each year is within the budgets
    of large corporations and governments.</p><p>There’s a precedent for this, too.
    <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/us/politics/att-helped-nsa-spy-on-an-array-of-internet-traffic.html\">AT&amp;T
    illegally monitored all of its traffic for years</a>.</p><p>Monitoring internet
    traffic at this level of detail would make pervasive censorship possible. This
    is one of the techniques China uses to re-write its history. And it works. Despite
    the advances in information technology, to this day many Chinese still <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/15/world/asia/tiananmen-square-fast-facts/\">don’t

    and terrifying technologies. How scared should we really be?</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/12000/0*IpADOf3NrK-RdCF0"

    the first Industrial Revolution, mankind has been scared of future technologies.
    <a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2011/07/11/women-and-children-first-technology-and-moral-panic/?re">People
    were afraid of electricity.</a> <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/67806/early-trains-were-thought-make-womens-uteruses-fly-out">People
    were afraid of trains and cars.</a> But it always took just one or two generations
    to get completely used to these innovations.</p><p>It’s true that most technologies
    caused harm in some ways, but the net outcome was usually good. This may be true
    for future technologies too, although there are serious ethical and philosophical
    reasons to be scared of some of them.</p><p>Some of them shouldn&#39;t really
    scare us. Some of them should. And some of them are already shaping our world.</p><p>Before
    we begin, I have to warn you: some of the things you will read in this story can
    be VERY controversial. I need you to approach this story with a very open mind,
    and acknowledge that the ideas I present here are just that, ideas.</p><p>I hold
    no extreme or fixed views, nor do I claim to have the exact answers to ethical
    and philosophical questions. You may have completely different ideas, and that’s
    totally fine.</p><h2>1. Cryonics</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/10368/0*zHTRxqAzdhi6PG8z"

    Danilina</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>Cryonics
    may seem very sci-fi (to be fair, everything in this story does), but it already
    exists. There are companies that freeze you as soon as you die, so you can be
    brought back to life when technology and medicine will be advanced enough.</p><p>Seriously,
    companies like <a href="https://alcor.org/">this</a> (I’m NOT affiliated to them).
    You can buy your immortality now if you want.</p><p><a href="http://blog.traceable.com/cryogenically-frozen-5-who-did-and-5-who-want-to">Here</a>’s
    a list of some celebrities that got frozen (James Bedford, Ted Williams, John
    Henry Williams, Dick Clair Jones, FM-2030), and some that are currently alive
    and want to be frozen (Seth McFarlane, Larry King, Simon Cowell, Paris Hilton,
    Britney Spears).</p><p>It’s unclear when and whether these people will be unfrozen.
    The technology to freeze people is not perfect yet, and there can be irreversible
    damages that will never be fixed, but it’s improving every year. On the other
    hand, the technology to unfreeze people doesn’t exist yet.</p><h3>Why Does It
    Scare Us</h3><p>People who have chosen to freeze themselves carry a social stigma.
    Nowadays, the idea of freezing our dead bodies seems very Frankenstein-y to most
    people.</p><p>People that choose to freeze themselves are often seen as deluded
    and cowards. They won’t accept death. They want to cheat on the fact that God,
    or nature, or the universe, wanted them dead.</p><h3>Should We Be Scared?</h3><p>Not
    really.</p><p>Do you know what else cheats death? CPR. The letter R literally
    stands for <em>Resuscitation</em>.</p><p>Do you know who else deludes themselves
    because they won’t accept death? Come on, answer it yourself. I don’t want to
    offend anyone.</p><p>Short answer: no, we should not be scared. At least not for
    the reasons mentioned above.</p><p>I think we should do anything possible to avoid
    death, period. Unless you are in a persistent vegetative state and have very good
    reasons to prefer death over useless suffering (even then, I would argue that
    future technologies could fix your condition), there is no reason why we should
    accept death. Life is fucking beautiful, I don’t want it to end.</p><p>Once you
    are already dead, what else do you have to lose? Maybe cryonics won’t work. Maybe
    people who are currently frozen have been irreversibly damaged. But they made
    a no-lose bet. They could either choose to die for sure, or give themselves a
    small chance to survive. What do you think is the obvious choice?</p><p>There
    is a serious problem, though. Hibernation is not cheap. When cryonics will become
    socially acceptable, more and more rich people will freeze themselves. Then it
    will be the turn of the middle class. And what about low-income people?</p><p>We
    are used to saying that, once we are dead, we are all the same, rich and poor.
    In the near future, this may not be true anymore, because only poor people will
    die.</p><p>Nowadays, death is normal. Many of us have experienced the loss of
    a loved one, but we knew that they had to go eventually. But what will happen
    when death will not be normal anymore? When it will be avoidable? The suffering
    will be much greater, and the idea that we will have a class of immortals and
    a class of mortals is seriously fucked up.</p><h2>2. Personal Decision-Makers</h2><p><img

    Izquierdo</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>Do
    you ever sit in your room, pondering a decision for hours? Do you ever regret
    decisions? Do you ever make a good decision but you don’t enjoy it because you
    think of what you have lost by not choosing the alternatives?</p><p>I know I do,
    all the time. But that will end soon.</p><p><a href="https://safety.google/privacy/privacy-controls/">Google</a>
    and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/your_information">Facebook</a> know you
    more than you know yourself. If optimal decisions are those that act in your best
    interest, isn’t it obvious to think that these companies will one day make decisions
    for you?</p><p>You won’t need to make decisions anymore: AI will make every decision
    for you, like which job to take, which person to date, what to eat for lunch.</p><h3>Why
    Does It Scare Us</h3><p>Having to make decisions may be difficult and frustrating,
    but it’s what makes us feel in control. It’s that thing that gives us whatever
    we call “free will”.</p><p>Society isn’t ready yet to stop believing in the existence
    of free will, although this is slowly changing. But even for those of us who don’t
    believe in free will, losing the ability to make decisions with our brains could
    be very demeaning. Especially if big corporations are those in control of decision-making
    algorithms.</p><h3>Should We Be Scared?</h3><p>Not really.</p><p>I predict that
    we will learn to surrender our decision-making ability very soon. We are already
    doing it. We don’t decide which series to watch, Netflix does. We don&#39;t decide
    which music to listen to, Spotify does. We don’t decide which book to read, Amazon
    does.</p><p>They make you feel in control of your decisions, because ultimately
    you are the one who clicks on the <em>play</em> button of the first episode of
    <em>Stranger Things</em>. But how could I know that you actually watched that
    series, if it was really <em>your</em> decision?</p><p>We don’t realize it, but
    corporations already drive our decision-making process with <em>recommender systems</em>.
    Yet we are often satisfied, because it works. AI is better than us at deciding
    what we like. Not making a decision directly doesn’t deprive us of the satisfaction
    that it brings us. If anything, we will enjoy it more, because we can’t regret
    decisions we never made.</p><p>We (probably) can live a happy and fulfilled one
    even if we are not in control. The need for control is an illusion and a cultural
    thing. Society evolves fast with technology, and the concept of free will won’t
    be relevant in the future.</p><p>If we have to be scared of something, it’s that
    someone can take advantage of this. Hackers and corporations themselves can manipulate
    our decisions for their own ends and we wouldn’t even know it.</p><p>If you think
    that you will retain your sense of control and will recognize when someone is
    trying to manipulate your decisions, think again. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">It
    has already happened</a>, with the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal. Data has
    been used to manipulate voters with personalized ads.</p><p>But still, people
    have manipulated people since the dawn of time. This problem would exist anyway,
    even without AI decision-makers.</p><h2>3. Artist AI</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*F_xdolkuuwIfSndC"
    alt="Photo by christies.com"><em>Photo by christies.com</em></p><p>In 2018, this
    painting <a href="https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx">has
    been sold at an auction</a> for $432,500. The artist is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">Generative
    Adversarial Network</a> (GAN), a type of “creative AI”.</p><p>I personally think
    that the painting kind of sucks, but GANs have been used to <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/gansynth">create
    music</a>, <a href="https://qz.com/1230470/the-hottest-trend-in-ai-is-perfect-for-creating-fake-media/">write
    fake news</a>, and <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">generate fake
    people</a>.</p><p>It won’t be long before AI will be used to create art better
    than humans. While most people claim that art should only be a human thing, because
    machines lack a “soul” or a “personality”, in some cases they can’t tell whether
    a piece of art has been created by a human or a machine. In other words, GANs
    have passed the art <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing
    Test</a>.</p><h3>Why Does It Scare Us</h3><p>We are now used to see AI getting
    better than us at everything. AI is better than us at <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2228752-ai-system-is-better-than-human-doctors-at-predicting-breast-cancer/">detecting
    cancer</a>. AI is better than us at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/07/alphazero-google-deepmind-ai-beats-champion-program-teaching-itself-to-play-four-hours">playing
    chess and Go</a>.</p><p>But come on, art? AI, will you give us a break?</p><p>We
    can’t still accept the fact that AI can be a better artist than us. Art is something
    inherently human, right? It is emotional, passionate, profound, it’s not logical
    and mathematical, right? It can’t be done by calculating derivatives or using
    Bayes’ theorem, right?</p><p>If there was one thing in which we could be better
    than AI, it was art. If even art is done better by AI, what value do we humans
    have to offer?</p><h3>Should We Be Scared?</h3><p>Maybe a little.</p><p>It depends
    on how it plays out.</p><p>On one side, people will enjoy more and better art.
    They will be used to AI being good at making art and they will benefit from it.</p><p>On
    the other side, human artists won’t be able to compete with AI.</p><p>Nobody will
    prevent human artists from creating art. But it won’t be seen or appreciated by
    other people. As an artist, you may like the process of making art, but if there
    is nobody to show it to, what’s the point in doing it?</p><p>There is one point
    in favor of human artists though. A good piece of art is defined by two factors:</p><ul><li><p>A
    strong emotional impact.</p></li><li><p>A strong message.</p></li></ul><p>AI can
    create the best emotional experience ever. But what about the message? Sure, AI
    can deliver a message as well, but would it be relatable?</p><p>A strong message
    should be drawn by personal experiences and observations, this is impossible to
    do for an AI. Again, this doesn’t mean that AI can’t deliver a message. It can
    deliver the best message ever, but it won’t be authentic. People can’t relate
    to it, because it has no human experience.</p><p>This is why, in the best case,
    people could decide to enjoy both AI and human art. We may even not refer to both
    of them as “art”, because they will be two different things. One will be more
    emotion-oriented, the other will be more message-oriented.</p><h2>4. Ultra-Realistic
    Sex Robots</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7200/0*RNhH_G33-jToxo-b"

    Graveris</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>Since
    the dawn of humanity, we have invented spectacular things like languages, art,
    tools, science, and ways to please ourselves without having to recur to actual
    sex all the time. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2908415/The-sex-toys-dating-28-000-years-Ancient-phalluses-stone-dried-camel-dung-started-trend-sex-aids.html">The
    first dildo</a> is 28,000 years old, way older than agriculture and human societies.</p><p>In
    a not so distant future (actually, it’s already happening), we will be invaded
    by androids and gynoids. But it won’t be a Terminator-like invasion. The only
    thing to invade will be our beds.</p><p>Sex may actually be the only use for androids
    and gynoids. I don’t see many other applications for humanoid robots.</p><p>Soon
    these sex robots will be ultra-realistic. They will be physically indistinguishable
    from real human beings. Sex with robots will feel just like real sex, if not better.
    AI will make these robots able to perform various moves and bend in any conceivable
    position. You will be able to have sex in any way you ever wanted and satisfy
    your weirdest fetishes.</p><p>Even more, sex robots will not only satisfy physical
    needs, but also emotional ones. You can talk with your sex robot about your problems,
    then cuddle, have sex and cuddle again. It will feel like a real person, an actual
    significant other, and you may even engage in a relationship with it.</p><p><a
    href="https://metro.co.uk/2010/01/11/worlds-first-sex-robot-with-a-personality-unveiled-as-roxxxy-23255/">There
    are already some prototypes of sex robots with personalities.</a></p><h3>Why Does
    It Scare Us</h3><p>There are three main reasons why sex robots scare us:</p><ul><li><p><a
    href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/7945518/sex-robots-hacked-record-users-expert-warns/">They
    can be hacked.</a> This is a common problem with most of the technologies described
    here. Did you piss someone off? They don’t have to get their hands dirty: all
    they have to do is reprogram your sex wife or husband to kill you. Maybe in a
    weird sex position so that it looks like an accident.</p></li><li><p>They replace
    real human affection. Why would you even bother to find a real partner, when sex
    robots can satisfy both your physical and emotional needs? You can save money
    for dinner and use it to hire a robot prostitute or buy a personal sex robot on
    Amazon.</p></li><li><p>They may lead us to extinction. Well, this is a direct
    consequence to the previous point: if you don’t care about finding a partner,
    you won’t have children.</p></li></ul><p>When sex robots will be common, we may
    all lose touch with reality. Also, sex robots will be way hotter than humans.
    If we get used to them, we may become unable to get physically attracted to other
    humans. We will become desensitized just like porn addicts are. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51330261">We
    will objectify human bodies even more.</a></p><h3>Should We Be Scared?</h3><p>Maybe
    a little.</p><p>While these three problems may be concerning, it’s unclear whether
    they will actually be that bad.</p><p>The problem is that we often fail to understand
    that society evolves. Sex is a societal aspect as well as a biological one. Some
    cultures values monogamy, others value polygamy. Some cultures value physical
    attractiveness, others don’t. Some cultures value homosexuality as a strength,
    others as a weakness.</p><p>Sex robots will surely become common. But it doesn’t
    necessarily mean it will be bad.</p><p>Nowadays, there is a stigma around sex
    robots. A few decades ago, there was a stigma around Internet porn. But today
    everybody visits Pornhub regularly without shame. The same is likely to happen
    with sex robots.</p><p>As societal values will evolve, we may not see much difference
    between human-human relationships and human-robot ones, as long as our physical
    and emotional needs are fulfilled. I’m not saying that this will be certain or
    that I want it to be true, I’m just saying that this is a real possibility. It’s
    society that evolves around technology, not vice versa.</p><p>What about sex robots
    being hacked? Well, some of us have smart homes, and they can be hacked as well.
    A very smart and motivated hacker could kill you remotely with the objects you
    have in your room now (unless you are reading this from your bathroom). So the
    problem is not specific to sex robots.</p><p>And what about extinction? Society
    will probably find some ways to keep producing babies. They may involve more in
    vitro fertilization than actual sex. And who knows, maybe robots will also be
    good parents.</p><p>Again, I’m not saying that I like it. I’m just saying that,
    eventually, we or our children will. The major problem I personally see with this
    is <em>love</em>. Love is about wanting to make another person happy. How can
    there be love if the thing to make happy is an apathetic robot?</p><p>If there
    is one sure positive outcome from this, it is that all crimes related to sex will
    be eliminated. There won’t be (human) prostitution anymore. There won’t be rape
    anymore. There won’t be domestic abuse. Even pedophiles can get children robots.</p><p>BEFORE
    YOU HATE ME for that last sentence, what would you prefer, a pedophile having
    sex with a child robot, or a pedophile having sex with a real child? If I visited
    someone’s home in 2040 and found a child robot there, I would still be sickened,
    but at least I would be relieved that that person wasn’t anywhere near a real
    child.</p><h2>5. Nanites</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9760/0*IP3MZJO7LinIzTBW"

    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanorobotics">Nanites</a> are nano-robots
    that one day will surround us everywhere. They would be too small to be visible
    (unless they are in swarms), but they would be everywhere. They would be in the
    air, in the water, on the surfaces, in our food, in our bodies, in our urine and
    feces.</p><p>They would have a swarm intelligence (no centralized control) and
    they would be able to replicate and adapt.</p><p>They could be used to clean the
    environment, 3d print anything, cure most illnesses, explore other planets, control
    the weather, and do many other sci-fi things.</p><h3>Why Does It Scare Us</h3><p>Would
    you trust millions of tiny and smart robots in your own body? I didn’t think so.</p><p>The
    reason is always the same: hacking. Whoever controls the nanobots, controls everything.
    Despite the fact that a decentralized system would be more resilient than a centralized
    one, a smart virus would be enough to destroy just about anything. Just program
    one nanobot to replicate its code in other nanobots and destroy itself after an
    hour. And watch the world collapse.</p><h3>Should We Be Scared?</h3><p>Probably.</p><p>Hacking
    will always be an issue. But one thing is hacking a bank account, another is hacking
    the air, the ocean, the buildings, human bodies. All it would take is one smart
    motivated angry person to destroy the world.</p><p>On the other hand, security
    grows together with hacking techniques. A technology as advanced as nanites is
    expected to be safe and secure. This is not enough to guarantee that nanites won’t
    destroy us, but I don’t think that would be the case.</p><p>I think that many
    other things could destroy us far before nanites will.</p><h2>6. Designer Babies</h2><p><img

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designer_baby">designer baby</a> is a baby
    who has been artificially created by genetic code manipulation.</p><p>Our advances
    in understanding the genetic code have been wonderful. We have been able to <a
    href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/20-years-after-dolly-the-sheep-led-the-way-where-is-cloning-now/">clone
    animals</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/11/the-five-chimeras-human-monkey-hybrid-genetic">build
    real chimeras</a>.</p><p>The purpose of designer babies is to create genetically
    strong humans, without diseases and with the desired features. You can build a
    tall, smart, kind, athletic kid without having to rely on the randomness of the
    genetic lottery.</p><h3>Why Does It Scare Us</h3><p>When we think of human genetic
    alteration and designer babies, we think of eugenics, then we think of Hitler
    and that triggers us.</p><p>It’s normal to be scared of genetic alterations. Messing
    with genes is commonly referred to as “playing God”, since it means manipulating
    the fabric of life itself. Messing with our genes too much may create something
    that isn’t even human.</p><p>If we feel the need to design our baby with particular
    features, it’s like we are giving these features an importance that is greater
    than human life itself.</p><p>In other words, this seemingly goes against the
    moral law that a child must be loved “no matter what”.</p><p>This also goes against
    every effort we have made in the past decades in trying to overcome racial differences.</p><p>We
    have always had trouble with genetic differences. These differences, like human
    races, are often reflected in class differences. Some decades ago, especially
    in the US, blacks and whites belonged to two different social classes. Now this
    distinction doesn’t formally exist anymore, but it’s still strongly present in
    human minds (just look at what’s happening in the US right now).</p><p>Designer
    babies will likely bring another class problem that is way worse than the racial
    one and the one described when talking about cryonics. What do you think will
    happen when rich people will start designing perfect kids while poor kids won’t
    be able to afford it? Will we have riots and #undesignedlivesmatter movements?</p><h3>Should
    We Be Scared?</h3><p>Maybe a little.</p><p>But the only real reason why we should
    be scared is the one just described, that is the risk of the birth of a new societal
    gap.</p><p>Meanwhile, the eugenics argument has to be put in context. The main
    reason why eugenics is such a bad word today, is the whole Hitler thing.</p><p>But
    there is a big difference between killing an “unhealthy” being and preventing
    it from being born.</p><p>And there is another big difference between choosing
    who mates with who and allowing any happy couple to have their genetically perfect
    child.</p><p>As long as “different” people aren’t treated differently, and people
    are allowed to mate with whoever they want, designer babies should not only be
    okay, but even encouraged.</p><p>Why am I saying such a controversial thing?</p><p>Seriously,
    what’s wrong in designing the features of your baby, instead of letting randomness
    choosing them for you? If you know you have a genetic disease, would you risk
    your child to carry it as well? I don’t know you, but I think that in that case,
    it would be crueler not to design your baby.</p><p>I really want to make this
    clear. Eugenics is not inherently bad if performed before conception (or before
    the fetus gains consciousness, although I don&#39;t want to make a pro-choice
    type of argument here). If you know your future child will have a disease, wouldn’t
    you want to spare them a life of suffering?</p><p>If you can’t afford such treatment,
    and your child is born with such disease, it doesn’t mean that they don’t deserve
    all the love of the world. They are not “unwanted”. You just wanted to give them
    a better life. And you still love them “no matter what”. They are worth no less
    than a genetically perfect child.</p><p>The problem is not genetic alteration
    itself, it’s society. The problem is that we let genetic features define us, while
    they should be just that, features. Anyone should have a healthy and happy child.
    Why risk unnecessary suffering just because you are afraid to go against God,
    nature, or the universe?</p><h2>7. Immersive Reality and Brain-Computer Interfaces</h2><p><img

    Derks</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>You
    may be familiar with Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). What you
    may be less familiar with are Immersive Reality (IR) and Brain-Computer Interfaces
    (BCI).</p><p>IR consists of immersing you into another reality by injecting that
    reality into your brain. In other words, it directly manipulates your brain waves
    to create experiences.</p><p>BCIs are the interfaces that allow for this manipulation.
    Imagine that you can reprogram your brain. Since the brain is the source of, well,
    pretty much everything you experience, having control over it can be very powerful.</p><p>With
    BCIs, you could not only immerse yourself into another reality, but also suppress
    your fears, change your personality, read 1,000 books in one second, communicate
    telepathically with other people, control robots (including nanites), control
    connected objects telekinetically, and get many other sci-fi superpowers.</p><h3>Why
    Does It Scare Us</h3><p>There are two aspects to be taken into consideration.</p><p>One
    is the perception of reality. IR, especially if used in videogames, can make you
    lose touch with your actual reality. You will spend more time in IR than in actual
    reality. You may not recognize the latter anymore.</p><p>Another aspect is that
    BCIs can turn you into something that is not human, or at least deprive you of
    basic human experiences. What will be of you when you will acquire all the superpowers
    mentioned above? If you can reprogram your mind just like a software, what will
    your life look like? What will happen when the basic experience of talking to
    another human being will be outdated because you can just communicate telepathically?</p><p>And
    what if, again, our minds get hacked?</p><h3>Should We Be Scared?</h3><p>Maybe
    a little.</p><p>Losing touch with reality has been a human habit since the Stone
    Age. Seventy thousand years ago (or probably more), we invented fiction. Since
    then, our ability to deliver fiction has always improved: oral stories, written
    stories, acts, movies, videogames, virtual realities.</p><p>It is just part of
    human nature. As long as you can give meaning to your life, does it even matter
    in which reality do you spend most of your time, whether it’s real or virtual?
    Hell, even our own reality <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis">can
    be just a simulation</a>. It doesn’t mean that it’s not meaningful. As long as
    you have consciousness, your life is meaningful, independently of the reality
    that hosts it.</p><p>But what if BCIs do more than immersing you into another
    reality? What if they change the structure of your mind? Like many other things,
    it depends on how it plays out.</p><p>I think that BCI superpowers won’t inherently
    be a bad thing, just like coffee is not a bad thing when it wakes you up, alcohol
    is not a bad thing when it makes you a bit dizzy, and weed is not a bad thing
    when it makes you a little relaxed (sorry, conservatives).</p><p>But what if you
    overdo it? What if it is addictive? What if it’s less like coffee and more like
    cocaine? Well, again, it depends on how it plays out. Society will need to come
    up with norms to regulate those experiences if necessary, while psychologists
    and neurologists should better understand the impact of these technologies on
    our minds before they become commonplace.</p><h2>8. Mind Upload</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7438/0*CkYSarX-EmvbrVOr"

    McCullough</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>Take
    the previous point, and stretch it to the extreme. You don’t just immerse yourself
    into another reality, you take your bags and move there.</p><p>I have recently
    finished the new Amazon series <em>Upload</em>. I suggest you give it a try, it’s
    pretty good.</p><p>In the <em>Upload</em> world, people can choose, instead of
    dying, to upload their minds into a virtual afterlife.</p><p>This may eventually
    happen for real. Your body may die, your brain may die, but the <em>information</em>
    in your mind can be exported and stored on a digital device. Your mind will be
    a file in a hard disk, in a USB stick, or in the cloud. Then you can keep living
    through a computer program that transforms the structure of that file in a way
    that is similar to the one in which electrical stimuli transform the structure
    of your brain.</p><h3>Why Does It Scare Us</h3><p>Sounds crazy? I know, right?
    That’s why it’s scary.</p><p>We don’t really know what will happen to our consciousness
    after an upload. And the scariest thing is that we may never be able to know it.</p><p>The
    thing is, yes, it’s crazy to think that you can live in a USB stick, but it’s
    also crazy to think that consciousness has to be dependent on a biological substratum.
    Why does it matter whether a neuron is made of proteins or information bits?</p><p>It
    isn’t even like your consciousness is stored in your particular brain cells. Your
    neurons are changed all the time, yet your consciousness is always there (yes,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenesis">new neurons are always created</a>,
    even if they don’t reproduce). Consciousness has to reside in <em>information</em>,
    so it could live in a USB stick too. Theoretically.</p><h3>Should We Be Scared?</h3><p>Probably.</p><p>Imagine
    what would happen if consciousness wasn’t retained after an upload. If every human
    will eventually upload, we will basically be extinct. There would be just a computer
    program running for nothing, and that’s it.</p><p>We may never know the answer.
    You can’t just ask someone if they have a consciousness, the answer will obviously
    be positive, since it relies on the same set of memories and phenomena that you
    can find in a human brain.</p><p>I personally think that consciousness will be
    retained. To be more precise, I think that consciousness isn’t “stored” in the
    brain or in a USB stick, but it’s something that arises when there are interactions,
    whether they are synaptic impulses or CPU cycles. But we can’t really prove that.</p><p>This
    doesn’t mean that we should ignore the problem. Chances are that mind upload will
    eventually happen, so it’s better if neuroscientists, engineers, and <a href="https://medium.com/predict/forget-about-coding-the-job-of-the-future-is-philosophy-33acadcee05a">philosophers</a>
    at least <em>try</em> to find an answer.</p><h2>9. Artificial General Intelligence</h2><p><img

    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">Artificial
    General Intelligence</a> (AGI) is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Our-Final-Invention-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/0312622376">last
    invention</a> we will ever need to make. An AGI is an AI that, like humans, can
    learn anything, not just one specific task like current AIs.</p><p>When an AGI
    will be created, it will recursively improve itself by becoming more intelligent.
    At some point, it will be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence">Artificial
    Super Intelligence</a> (ASI), a being so smart that we would be like ants to it.</p><p>At
    this point, two things can happen. Either the ASI will build a utopia for us,
    or it will drive us towards extinction. There is no in-between.</p><h3>Why Does
    It Scare Us</h3><p>Movies like <em>Terminator</em>, <em>Ex Machina</em>,* 2001:
    A Space Odyssey<em>,</em> Transcendence* showed us hypothetical worlds in which
    AIs went rogue.</p><p>There is a lot of confusion about this. Some people believe
    that an AGI can never be created because there is “something” about the human
    mind that can’t be replicated.</p><p>Others believe that an AGI would gain self-consciousness
    and get sick of being the humans’ slave, so it would rebel.</p><p>An AGI will
    likely be created at some point, because there is no reason to believe that there
    is that “something” about the human mind, especially about human <em>intelligence</em>.
    Also, an AGI won’t gain self-consciousness, because intelligence and consciousness
    are two separate things.</p><p>Yet there are different reasons to be scared.</p><h3>Should
    We Be Scared?</h3><p>Yes.</p><p>The problem with AI is that it’s difficult to
    tell it what its goals and boundaries should be. We are messy, we are complicated,
    we don’t know what we want.</p><p>If AGI goals aren’t <em>aligned</em> with ours,
    we incur the Alignment Problem, and very bad things can happen.</p><p>Let’s take
    for example the <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer">paperclip
    maximizer</a> experiment. A simple task like producing paperclips can turn into
    an existential risk for us. Why?</p><p>Because an AGI would always find the most
    efficient way to reach its goals. For example, it could turn all the atoms in
    the Earth into paperclips, including our bodies.</p><p>If we specify not to kill
    us, it will still find a loophole to make our lives miserable. To avoid this,
    we have to specify every single condition. And it’s not simple.</p><p>It’s not
    that AGI will actively try to kill us. It’s just amazingly difficult not to hurt
    us. We need many things in order to live a good life, and we need to make sure
    that AGI doesn’t compromise these things by mistake.</p><p>There are some instances
    though in which AGI would actively want to kill us. Since we are so unpredictable,
    AGI may think that we would get scared and try to stop it from reaching the goals
    that we ourselves gave it.</p><p>This is probably the most difficult problem we
    will ever have to solve. And also the last one.</p><p>If you want to further explore
    this subject, I recommend you read <em>Superintelligence</em> by Nick Bostrom.
    It uses a strong academic language, but it’s a worthy read.</p><p>Since I was
    15 or something, I have dreamt to build an AGI. Now, I dream to make sure that,
    when it will come, AGI won’t kill us.</p><p>Technology is a wonderful thing, but
    it can also be scary. This has never been as true as it is now. We have a kind
    of power that we would have never imagined before.</p><p>Technological improvements
    can only be good if they are guided by wisdom improvements. If we can’t make wise
    choices on how to use God-like technologies, we are doomed for sure.</p><p>EDIT:
    I wasn’t expecting the huge success this story got. I am really grateful for that.</p><p>Still,
    as I expected, this story generated some controversies and critiques. Unfortunately,
    I don’t have the time to respond to everyone personally, so I decided to summarize
    the most common ones here:</p><ul><li><p>English is not my first language. If
    any sentence contains mistakes or sounds too weird, I would gladly appreciate
    any constructive criticism.</p></li><li><p>I didn’t mean this story to be exhaustive.
    Of course, there are many technologies I haven’t mentioned. For example, bioweapons.
    Here, I only wanted to talk about technologies that will likely shape <em>your</em>
    future, i.e. those with sociological ramifications.</p></li><li><p>I am aware
    that this story lacks a spiritual perspective. I am not a spiritual person, and
    even if I were, nobody should impose their spiritual views on others. That said,
    the lack of spirituality doesn’t make my ideas cold or emotionless. Emotions exist
    even without spirituality. One could live a meaningful life even without spirituality.
    That was the whole point of this story! Showing the impact of these technologies
    on what it means to be human. I also explored this subject in <a href="https://medium.com/predict/forget-about-coding-the-job-of-the-future-is-philosophy-33acadcee05a">this
    story</a>.</p></li><li><p>About cryonics, the correct term is <em>vitrification</em>,
    not <em>freezing</em>. I used the latter to keep things simple for the purposes
    of this story, but some readers correctly said that just “freezing” a body would
    kill it. Vitrification is a more complex process that keeps the organic structure
    of the body intact.</p></li><li><p>No, cryonics doesn&#39;t work yet. We don’t
    know how to devitrify a body, but the vitrified bodies have nowhere to go until
    we figure it out.</p></li><li><p>About Personal Decision-Makers, they are supposed
    to make choices for you because they know you better than you know <em>yourself</em>.
    Their main purpose shouldn’t be <em>control</em>. If they are used to control
    people, I agree that they are bad. But if they are only used to accelerate your
    decision process, I don’t think they are bad at all. No, I am not a fascist.</p></li><li><p>About
    sex robots, this was the point I explored with the most depth. The depth was needed
    because the pervasiveness of sex robots will have sociological ramifications that
    are too complex to be explained in a few sentences. It wasn’t because I want to
    fuck a robot :)</p></li><li><p>Yes, I know that not <em>literally</em> everyone
    watches porn :)</p></li><li><p>As one reader pointed out, I overlooked power as
    a motivator for rape. That’s a good point. But we may become so desensitized to
    actual sex that we may find it difficult or even disgusting to do it with real
    humans, when we are used to extremely hot robots. Honestly, I don’t know how this
    will play out.</p></li><li><p>Most of the controversies and doubts were related
    to the AGI point. The dangers of AGI are yet another thing that can’t be explained
    in a few sentences. So, if you are interested, I wrote <a href="https://medium.com/predict/why-we-should-really-be-afraid-of-ai-an-analysis-of-obvious-and-non-obvious-dangers-cb2dfb8f905d">another
    story</a> just to delve into these dangers.</p></li><li><p>I am also aware of
    the AI winters. Yes, we may be heading towards another one. But it doesn’t mean
    that AGI will never be created. Other factors, like the increased computational
    power over the last few decades, play a huge role. Neural networks, for example,
    exist since 1943, but they only started to become pervasive in the last 20 years.</p></li></ul><p>On
    the other hand, this story generated a lot of constructive discussions and I love
    it. Remember, I am fully aware that anything I said can turn out to be wrong.
    Nobody can really predict the future. It’s okay to disagree.</p>'

    Quattro Fontane, c. 1638; TBD, c. 2017</em></p><p>Being so logical and precise
    is fun for only so long. Eventually we’ll just start breaking rules. In architecture
    that meant literally breaking apart Classic elements and twisting them into complex
    forms. Compared with the Renaissance intellectualism, Baroque designs were emotional
    and theatric.</p><p>How will we do this with web design? It’s hard to say. But
    wait for it — it’s coming in a couple years.</p><h2><strong><em>VII. Neoclassical</em></strong></h2><h3><em>Harkening

    to glorify our Classical beginnings and go full retro. It just takes time. Neoclassical
    web design is a ways ahead — that old Yahoo website still looks pretty lame to
    us, not sacred. But six, seven years from now? It’ll be cool again.</p><h2><strong><em>VIII.
    After that, who knows?</em></strong></h2><p>Well, we kinda know. It will likely
    be some form of Neoromanesque or Neogothic. Something neo. Art continually repeats
    itself in the form of revivals. But eventually? A new technology and a new world
    view will arrive that we can’t even imagine today.</p><p>Then things will get
    weird.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vnO6VnW4DLGPQP03Hztw4Q.png"

  :title: 73 Mind-Blowing Implications of a Driverless Future
  :content: '<p>73 Mind-Blowing Implications of Driverless Cars and Trucks</p><p>I
    originally wrote and published a version of this article in September 2016. Since
    then, quite a bit has happened, further cementing my view that these changes are
    coming and that the implications will be even more substantial. I decided it was
    time to update this article with some additional ideas and a few changes.</p><p>As
    I write this, Uber just announced that it just ordered 24,000 self-driving Volvos.
    Tesla just released an electric, long-haul tractor trailer with extraordinary
    technical specs (range, performance) and self-driving capabilities (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-tesla-orders/ups-reserves-125-tesla-semi-trucks-largest-public-pre-order-yet-idUSKBN1ED1QM">UPS
    just preordered 125!</a>). And, Tesla just announced what will probably be the
    quickest production car ever made — perhaps the fastest. It will go zero to sixty
    in about the time it takes you to read zero to sixty. And, of course, it will
    be able to drive itself. The future is quickly becoming now. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/29/waymo-orders-thousands-of-pacificas-for-2018-self-driving-fleet-rollout/?ncid=rss">Google
    just ordered thousands of Chryslers</a> for its self-driving fleet (that are already
    on the roads in AZ).</p><p>In September of 2016, Uber had just rolled out its
    first self-driving taxis in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjsz4nXxYrPAhXLHB4KHZaPAegQFggqMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fbusiness%2Finside-pittsburghs-drivers-seat-move-on-ubers-autonomous-car-testing%2F2016%2F09%2F02%2Fc5d2462a-6fc7-11e6-9705-23e51a2f424d_story.html&usg=AFQjCNHAMLN4XLH1Aw6GQmFGAeGJuwxCWA">Pittsburgh</a>,
    <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiN7YvpxYrPAhVG1B4KHT2eCXQQFgglMAM&url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F524400%2Ftesla-just-transformed-the-model-s-into-a-nearly-driverless-car%2F&usg=AFQjCNG74pnv32_UFtjYLB4XUWROnqWWcw&bvm=bv.132479545,d.dmo">Tesla</a>
    and <a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/innovation/research-vehicle-f-015-luxury-in-motion/">Mercedes
    </a>were rolling out limited self-driving capabilities and <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/04/20/singapore-driverless-cars/">cities
    around the world</a> were negotiating with companies who want to bring self-driving
    cars and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj5tIf6xYrPAhUH2B4KHZP8DosQtwIIHDAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9pltUUxI__E&usg=AFQjCNEqYTkkjHOfmIDzdQy9O9qtbsGtAg&bvm=bv.132479545,d.dmo">trucks</a>
    to their cities. Since then, all of the major car companies have announced significant
    steps towards mostly or entirely electric vehicles, more investments have been
    made in autonomous vehicles, driverless trucks now seem to be leading rather than
    following in terms of the first large scale implementations and there’ve been
    a few more incidents (i.e. accidents).</p><p>I believe that the timeframe for
    significant adoption of this technology has shrunk in the past year as technology
    has gotten better faster and as the trucking industry has increased its level
    of interest and investment.</p><p>I believe that my daughter, who is now just
    over 1 years old, will never have to learn to drive or own a car.</p><p><em>The
    impact of driverless vehicles will be profound and impact almost every part of
    our lives.</em></p><p>Below are my updated thoughts about what a driverless future
    will be like. Some of these updates are from feedback to my original article (thanks
    to those who contributed!!!), some are based on technology advances in the past
    year and others are just my own speculations.</p><p><strong>What could happen
    when cars and trucks drive themselves?</strong></p><ol><li><p>People won’t own
    their own cars. Transport will be delivered as a service from companies who own
    fleets of self-driving vehicles. There are so many technical, economic, safety
    advantages to the transportation-as-a-service that this change may come much faster
    than most people expect. Owning a vehicle as an individual will become a novelty
    for collectors and maybe competitive racers.</p></li><li><p>Software/technology
    companies will own more of the world’s economy as companies like Uber, Google
    and Amazon turn transportation into a pay-as-you-go service. Software will indeed
    eat this world. Over time, they’ll own so much data about people, patterns, routes
    and obstacles that new entrants will have huge barriers to enter the market</p></li><li><p>Without
    government intervention (or some sort of organized movement), there will be a
    tremendous transfer of wealth to a very small number of people who own the software,
    battery/power manufacturing, vehicle servicing and charging/power generation/maintenance
    infrastructure. There will be massive consolidation of companies serving these
    markets as scale and efficiency will become even more valuable. Cars (perhaps
    they’ll be renamed with some sort-of-clever acronym) will become like the routers
    that run the Internet — most consumers won’t know or care who made them or who
    owns them.</p></li><li><p>Vehicle designs will change radically — vehicles won’t
    need to withstand crashes in the same way, all vehicles will be electric (self-driving
    + software + service providers = all electric). They may look different, come
    in very different shapes and sizes, maybe attach to each other in some situations.
    There will likely be many significant innovations in materials used for vehicle
    construction — for example, tires and brakes will be re-optimized with very different
    assumptions, especially around variability of loads and much more controlled environments.
    The bodies will likely be primarily made of composites (like carbon fiber and
    fiberglass) and 3D printed. Electric vehicles with no driver controls will require
    1/10th or fewer the number of parts (perhaps even 1/100th) and thus will be quicker
    to produce and require much less labor. There may even be designs with almost
    no moving parts (other than wheels and motors, obviously).</p></li><li><p>Vehicles
    will mostly swap batteries rather than serve as the host of battery charging.
    Batteries will be charged in distributed and highly optimized centers — likely
    owned by the same company as the vehicles or another national vendor. There may
    be some entrepreneurial opportunity and a marketplace for battery charging and
    swapping, but this industry will likely be consolidated quickly. The batteries
    will be exchanged without human intervention — likely in a carwash-like drive
    thru</p></li><li><p>Vehicles (being electric) will be able to provide portable
    power for a variety of purposes (which will also be sold as a service) — construction
    job sites (why use generators), disaster/power failures, events, etc. They may
    even temporarily or permanently replace power distribution networks (i.e. power
    lines) for remote locations — imagine a distributed power generation network with
    autonomous vehicles providing “last mile” services to some locations</p></li><li><p>Driver’s
    licenses will slowly go away as will the Department of Motor Vehicles in most
    states. Other forms of ID may emerge as people no longer carry driver’s licenses.
    This will probably correspond with the inevitable digitization of all personal
    identification — via prints, retina scans or other biometric scanning</p></li><li><p>There
    won’t be any parking lots or parking spaces on roads or in buildings. Garages
    will be repurposed — maybe as mini loading docks for people and deliveries. Aesthetics
    of homes and commercial buildings will change as parking lots and spaces go away.
    There will be a multi-year boom in landscaping and basement and garage conversions
    as these spaces become available</p></li><li><p>Traffic policing will become redundant.
    Police transport will also likely change quite a bit. Unmanned police vehicles
    may become more common and police officers may use commercial transportation to
    move around routinely. This may dramatically change the nature of policing, with
    newfound resources from the lack of traffic policing and dramatically less time
    spent moving around</p></li><li><p>There will be no more local mechanics, car
    dealers, consumer car washes, auto parts stores or gas stations. Towns that have
    been built around major thoroughfares will change or fade</p></li><li><p>The auto
    insurance industry as we know it will go away (as will the significant investing
    power of the major players of this industry). Most car companies will go out of
    business, as will most of their enormous supplier networks. There will be many
    fewer net vehicles on the road (maybe 1/10th, perhaps even less) that are also
    more durable, made of fewer parts and much more commoditized</p></li><li><p>Traffic
    lights and signs will become obsolete. Vehicles may not even have headlights as
    infrared and radar take the place of the human light spectrum. The relationship
    between pedestrians (and bicycles) and cars and trucks will likely change dramatically.
    Some will come in the form of cultural and behavioral changes as people travel
    in groups more regularly and walking or cycling becomes practical in places where
    it isn’t today</p></li><li><p>Multi-modal transportation will become a more integrated
    and normal part of our ways of moving around. In other words, we’ll often take
    one type of vehicle to another, especially when traveling longer distances. With
    coordination and integration, the elimination of parking and more deterministic
    patterns, it will become ever-more efficient to combine modes of transport</p></li><li><p>The
    power grid will change. Power stations via alternative power sources will become
    more competitive and local. Consumers and small businesses with solar panels,
    small scale tidal or wave power generators, windmills and other local power generation
    will be able to sell KiloWattHours to the companies who own the vehicles. This
    will change “net metering” rules and possibly upset the overall power delivery
    model. It might even be the beginning of truly distributed power creation and
    transport. There will likely be a significant boom in innovation in power production
    and delivery models. Over time, ownership of these services will probably be consolidated
    across a very small number of companies</p></li><li><p>Traditional petroleum products
    (and other fossil fuels) will become much less valuable as electric cars replace
    fuel powered vehicles and as alternative energy sources become more viable with
    portability of power (transmission and conversion eat tons of power). There are
    many geopolitical implications to this possible shift. As implications of climate
    change become ever-clearer and present, these trends will likely accelerate. Petroleum
    will continue to be valuable for making plastics and other derived materials,
    but will not be burned for energy at any scale. Many companies, oil-rich countries
    and investors have already begun accommodating for these changes</p></li><li><p>Entertainment
    funding will change as the auto industry’s ad spending goes away. Think about
    how many ads you see or hear about cars, car financing, car insurance, car accessories
    and car dealers. There are likely to be many other structural and cultural changes
    that come from the dramatic changes to the transportation industry. We’ll stop
    saying “shift into high gear” and other driving-related colloquialisms as the
    references will be lost on future generations</p></li><li><p>The recent corporate
    tax rate reductions in the “..Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles
    II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018” will
    accelerate investments in automation including self-driving vehicles and other
    forms of transportation automation. Flush with new cash and incentives to invest
    capital soon, many businesses will invest in technology and solutions that reduce
    their labor costs.</p></li><li><p>The car financing industry will go away, as
    will the newly huge derivative market for packaged sub-prime auto loans which
    will likely itself cause a version of the 2008–2009 financial crisis as it blows
    up.</p></li><li><p>Increases in unemployment, increased student loan, vehicle
    and other debt defaults could quickly spiral into a full depression. The world
    that emerges on the other side will likely have even more dramatic income and
    wealth stratification as entry level jobs related to transportation and the entire
    supply chain of the existing transportation system go away. The convergence of
    this with hyper-automation in production and service delivery (AI, robotics, low-cost
    computing, business consolidation, etc) may permanently change how societies are
    organized and how people spend their time</p></li><li><p>There will be many new
    innovations in luggage and bags as people no longer keep stuff in cars and loading
    and unloading packages from vehicles becomes much more automated. The traditional
    trunk size and shape will change. Trailers or other similar detachable devices
    will become much more commonplace to add storage space to vehicles. Many additional
    on demand services will become available as transportation for goods and services
    becomes more ubiquitous and cheaper. Imagine being able to design, 3D print and
    put on an outfit as you travel to a party or the office (if you’re still going
    to an office)…</p></li><li><p>Consumers will have more money as transportation
    (a major cost, especially for lower income people and families) gets much cheaper
    and ubiquitous — though this may be offset by dramatic reductions in employment
    as technology changes many times faster than people’s ability to adapt to new
    types of work</p></li><li><p>Demand for taxi and truck drivers will go down, eventually
    to zero. Someone born today might not understand what a truck driver is or even
    understand why someone would do that job — much like people born in the last 30
    years don’t understand how someone could be employed as a switchboard operator</p></li><li><p>The
    politics will get ugly as lobbyists for the auto and oil industries unsuccessfully
    try to stop the driverless car. They’ll get even uglier as the federal government
    deals with assuming huge pension obligations and other legacy costs associated
    with the auto industry. My guess is that these pension obgligations won’t ultimately
    be honored and certain communities will be devastated. The same may be true of
    pollution clean-up efforts around the factories and chemical plants that were
    once major components of the vehicle supply chain</p></li><li><p>The new players
    in vehicle design and manufacturing will be a mix of companies like Uber, Google
    and Amazon and companies you don’t yet know. There will probably be 2 or 3 major
    players who control &gt;80% of the customer-facing transportation market. There
    may become API-like access to these networks for smaller players — much like app
    marketplaces for iPhone and Android. However, the majority of the revenue will
    flow to a few large players as it does today to Apple and Google for smartphones</p></li><li><p>Supply
    chains will be disrupted as shipping changes. Algorithms will allow trucks to
    be fuller. Excess (latent) capacity will be priced cheaper. New middlemen and
    warehousing models will emerge. As shipping gets cheaper, faster and generally
    easier, retail storefronts will continue to lose footing in the marketplace.</p></li><li><p>The
    role of malls and other shopping areas will continue to shift — to be replaced
    by places people go for services, not products. There will be virtually no face
    to face purchases of physical goods.</p></li><li><p>Amazon and/or a few other
    large players will put Fedex, UPS and USPS out of business as their transportation
    network becomes orders of magnitude more cost efficient than existing models —
    largely from a lack of legacy costs like pensions, higher union labor costs and
    regulations (especially USPS) that won’t keep up with the pace of technology change.
    3D printing will also contribute to this as many day-to-day products are printed
    at home rather than purchased.</p></li><li><p>The same vehicles will often transport
    people and goods as algorithms optimize all routes. And, off-peak utilization
    will allow for other very inexpensive delivery options. In other words, packages
    will be increasingly delivered at night. Add autonomous drone aircraft to this
    mix and there’ll be very little reason to believe that traditional carriers (Fedex,
    USPS, UPS, etc) will survive at all.</p></li><li><p>Roads will be much emptier
    and smaller (over time) as self-driving cars need much less space between them
    (a major cause of traffic today), people will share vehicles more than today (carpooling),
    traffic flow will be better regulated and algorithmic timing (i.e. leave at 10
    versus 9:30) will optimize infrastructure utilization. Roads will also likely
    be smoother and turns optimally banked for passenger comfort. High speed underground
    and above ground tunnels (maybe integrating hyperloop technology or this <a href="http://www.arrivo-loop.com/updates/">novel
    magnetic track solution)</a> will become the high speed network for long haul
    travel.</p></li><li><p>Short hop domestic air travel may be largely displaced
    by multi-modal travel in autonomous vehicles. This may be countered by the advent
    of lower cost, more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/14/dubai-plans-to-introduce-flying-drone-taxis-as-early-as-this-summer/">automated
    air travel</a>. This too may become part of integrated, multi-modal transportation.</p></li><li><p>Roads
    will wear out much more slowly with fewer vehicle miles, lighter vehicles (with
    less safety requirements). New road materials will be developed that drain better,
    last longer and are more environmentally friendly. These materials might even
    be power generating (solar or reclamation from vehicle kinetic energy). At the
    extreme, they may even be replaced by radically different designs — tunnels, magnetic
    tracks, other hyper-optimized materials</p></li><li><p>Premium vehicle services
    will have more compartmentalized privacy, more comfort, good business features
    (quiet, wifi, bluetooth for each passenger, etc), massage services and beds for
    sleeping. They may also allow for meaningful in-transit real and virtual meetings.
    This will also likely include aromatherapy, many versions of in-vehicle entertainment
    systems and even virtual passengers to keep you company.</p></li><li><p>Exhilaration
    and emotion will almost entirely leave transportation. People won’t brag about
    how nice, fast, comfortable their cars are. Speed will be measured by times between
    end points, not acceleration, handling or top speed.</p></li><li><p>Cities will
    become much more dense as fewer roads and vehicles will be needed and transport
    will be cheaper and more available. The “walkable city” will continue to be more
    desirable as walking and biking become easier and more commonplace. When costs
    and timeframes of transit change, so will the dynamics of who lives and works
    where.</p></li><li><p>People will know when they leave, when they’ll get where
    they’re going. There will be few excuses for being late. We will be able to leave
    later and cram more into a day. We’ll also be able to better track kids, spouses,
    employees and so forth. We’ll be able to know exactly when someone will arrive
    and when someone needs to leave to be somewhere at a particular time.</p></li><li><p>There
    will be no more DUI/OUI offenses. Restaurants and bars will sell more alcohol.
    People will consume more as they no longer need to consider how to get home and
    will be able to consume inside vehicles</p></li><li><p>We’ll have less privacy
    as interior cameras and usage logs will track when and where we go and have gone.
    Exterior cameras will also probably record surroundings, including people. This
    may have a positive impact on crime, but will open up many complex privacy issues
    and likely many lawsuits. Some people may find clever ways to game the system
    — with physical and digital disguises and spoofing.</p></li><li><p>Many lawyers
    will lose sources of revenue — traffic offenses, crash litigation will reduce
    dramatically. Litigation will more likely be “big company versus big company”
    or “individuals against big companies”, not individuals against each other. These
    will settle more quickly with less variability. Lobbyists will probably succeed
    in changing the rules of litigation to favor the bigger companies, further reducing
    the legal revenue related to transportation. Forced arbitration and other similar
    clauses will become an explicit component of our contractual relationship with
    transportation providers.</p></li><li><p>Some countries will nationalize parts
    of their self-driving transportation networks which will result in lower costs,
    fewer disruptions and less innovation.</p></li><li><p>Cities, towns and police
    forces will lose revenue from traffic tickets, tolls (likely replaced, if not
    eliminated) and fuel tax revenues drop precipitously. These will probably be replaced
    by new taxes (probably on vehicle miles). These may become a major political hot-button
    issue differentiating parties as there will probably be a range of regressive
    versus progressive tax models. Most likely, this will be a highly regressive tax
    in the US, as fuel taxes are today.</p></li><li><p>Some employers and/or government
    programs will begin partially or entirely subsidizing transportation for employees
    and/or people who need the help. The tax treatment of this perk will also be very
    political.</p></li><li><p>Ambulance and other emergency vehicles will likely be
    used less and change in nature. More people will take regular autonomous vehicles
    instead of ambulances. Ambulances will transport people faster. Same may be true
    of military vehicles.</p></li><li><p>There will be significant innovations in
    first response capabilities as dependencies on people become reduced over time
    and as distributed staging of capacity becomes more common.</p></li><li><p>Airports
    will allow vehicles right into the terminals, maybe even onto the tarmac, as increased
    controls and security become possible. Terminal design may change dramatically
    as transportation to and from becomes normalized and integrated. The entire nature
    of air travel may change as integrated, multi-modal transport gets more sophisticated.
    Hyper-loops, high speed rail, automated aircraft and other forms of rapid travel
    will gain as traditional hub and spoke air travel on relatively large planes lose
    ground.</p></li><li><p>Innovative app-like marketplaces will open up for in-transit
    purchases, ranging from concierge services to food to exercise to merchandise
    to education to entertainment purchases. VR will likely play a large role in this.
    With integrated systems, VR (via headsets or screens or holograms) will become
    standard fare for trips more than a few minutes in duration.</p></li><li><p>Transportation
    will become more tightly integrated and packaged into many services — dinner includes
    the ride, hotel includes local transport, etc. This may even extend to apartments,
    short-term rentals (like AirBnB) and other service providers.</p></li><li><p>Local
    transport of nearly everything will become ubiquitous and cheap — food, everything
    in your local stores. Drones will likely be integrated into vehicle designs to
    deal with “last few feet” on pickup and delivery. This will accelerate the demise
    of traditional retail stores and their local economic impact.</p></li><li><p>Biking
    and walking will become easier, safer and more common as roads get safer and less
    congested, new pathways (reclaimed from roads/parking lots/roadside parking) come
    online and with cheap, reliable transport available as a backup.</p></li><li><p>More
    people will participate in vehicle racing (cars, off road, motorcycles) to replace
    their emotional connection to driving. Virtual racing experiences may also grow
    in popularity as fewer people have the real experience of driving.</p></li><li><p>Many,
    many fewer people will be injured or killed on roads, though we’ll expect zero
    and be disproportionately upset when accidents do happen. Hacking and non-malicious
    technical issues will replace traffic as the main cause of delays. Over time,
    resilience will increase in the systems.</p></li><li><p>Hacking of vehicles will
    be a serious issue. New software and communications companies and technologies
    will emerge to address these issues. We’ll see the first vehicle hacking and its
    consequences. Highly distributed computing, perhaps using some form of blockchain,
    will likely become part of the solution as a counterbalance to systemic catastrophes
    — such as many vehicles being affected simultaneously. There will probably be
    a debate about whether and how law enforcement can control, observe and restrict
    transportation.</p></li><li><p>Many roads and bridges will be privatized as a
    small number of companies control most transport and make deals with municipalities.
    Over time, government may entirely stop funding roads, bridges and tunnels. There
    will be a significant legislative push to privatize more and more of the transportation
    network. Much like Internet traffic, there will likely become tiers of prioritization
    and some notion of in-network versus out-of-network travel and tolls for interconnection.
    Regulators will have a tough time keeping up with these changes. Most of this
    will be transparent to end users, but will probably create enormous barriers to
    entry for transportation start-ups and ultimately reduce options for consumers.</p></li><li><p>Innovators
    will come along with many awesome uses for driveways and garages that no longer
    contain cars.</p></li><li><p>There will be a new network of clean, safe, pay-to-use
    restrooms and other services (food, drinks, etc) that become part of the value-add
    of competing service providers</p></li><li><p>Mobility for seniors and people
    with disabilities will be greatly improved (over time)</p></li><li><p>Parents
    will have more options to move around their kids on their own. Premium secure
    end-to-end children’s transport services will likely emerge. This may change many
    family relationships and increase the accessibility of services to parents and
    children. It may also further stratify the experiences of families with higher
    income and those with lower income.</p></li><li><p>Person to person movement of
    goods will become cheaper and open up new markets — think about borrowing a tool
    or buying something on Craigslist. Latent capacity will make transporting goods
    very inexpensive. This may also open up new opportunities for P2P services at
    a smaller scale — like preparing food or cleaning clothes.</p></li><li><p>People
    will be able to eat/drink in transit (like on a train or plane), consume more
    information (reading, podcasts, video, etc). This will open up time for other
    activities and perhaps increased productivity.</p></li><li><p>Some people may
    have their own “pods” to get into which will then be picked up by an autonomous
    vehicle, moved between vehicles automatically for logistic efficiencies. These
    may come in varieties of luxury and quality — the Louis Vuitton pod may replace
    the Louis Vuitton trunk as the mark of luxury travel</p></li><li><p>There will
    be no more getaway vehicles or police vehicle chases.</p></li><li><p>Vehicles
    will likely be filled to the brim with advertising of all sorts (much of which
    you could probably act on in-route), though there will probably be ways to pay
    more to have an ad free experience. This will include highly personalized en route
    advertising that is particularly relevant to who you are, where you’re going.</p></li><li><p>These
    innovations will make it to the developing world where congestion today is often
    remarkably bad and hugely costly. Pollution levels will come down dramatically.
    Even more people will move to the cities. Productivity levels will go up. Fortunes
    will be made as these changes happen. Some countries and cities will be transformed
    for the better. Some others will likely experience hyper-privatization, consolidation
    and monopoly-like controls. This may play out much like the roll-out of cell services
    in these countries — fast, consolidated and inexpensive.</p></li><li><p>Payment
    options will be greatly expanded, with packaged deals like cell phones, pre-paid
    models, pay-as-you-go models being offered. Digital currency transacted automatically
    via phones/devices will probably quickly replace traditional cash or credit card
    payments.</p></li><li><p>There will likely be some very clever innovations for
    movement of pets, equipment, luggage and other non-people items. Autonomous vehicles
    in the medium future (10–20 years) may have radically different designs that support
    carrying significantly more payload.</p></li><li><p>Some creative marketers will
    offer to partially or fully subsidize rides where customers deliver value — by
    taking surveys, by participating in virtual focus groups, by promoting their brand
    via social media, etc.</p></li><li><p>Sensors of all sorts will be embedded in
    vehicles that will have secondary uses — like improving weather forecasting, crime
    detection and prevention, finding fugitives, infrastructure conditions (such as
    potholes). This data will be monetized, likely by the companies who own the transportation
    services.</p></li><li><p>Companies like Google and Facebook will add to their
    databases everything about customer movements and locations. Unlike GPS chips
    that only tell them where someone is at the moment (and where they’ve been), autonomous
    vehicle systems will know where you’re going in real-time (and with whom).</p></li><li><p>Autonomous
    vehicles will create some new jobs and opportunities for entrepreneurs. However,
    these will be off-set many times by extraordinary job losses by nearly everyone
    in the transportation value chain today. In the autonomous future, a large number
    of jobs will go away. This includes drivers (which is in many states today the
    most common job), mechanics, gas station employees, most of the people who make
    cars and car parts or support those who do (due to huge consolidation of makers
    and supply chains and manufacturing automation), the marketing supply chain for
    vehicles, many people who work on and build roads/bridges, employees of vehicle
    insurance and financing companies (and their partners/suppliers), toll booth operators
    (most of whom have already been displaced), many employees of restaurants that
    support travelers, truck stops, retail workers and all the people whose businesses
    support these different types of companies and workers.</p></li><li><p>There will
    be some hardcore hold-outs who really like driving. But, over time, they’ll become
    a less statistically relevant voting group as younger people, who’ve never driven,
    will outnumber them. At first, this may be a 50 state regulated system — where
    driving yourself may actually become illegal in some states in the next 10 years
    while other states may continue to allow it for a long time. Some states will
    try, unsuccessfully, to block autonomous vehicles.</p></li><li><p>There will be
    lots of discussions about new types of economic systems — from universal basic
    income to new variations of socialism to a more regulated capitalist system —
    that will result from the enormous impacts of autonomous vehicles.</p></li><li><p>In
    the path to a truly driverless future, there will be a number of key tipping points.
    At the moment, freight delivery may push autonomous vehicle use sooner than people
    transport. Large trucking companies may have the financial means and legislative
    influence to make rapid, dramatic changes. They are also better positioned to
    support hybrid approaches where only parts of their fleet or parts of the routes
    are automated.</p></li><li><p>Autonomous vehicles will radically change the power
    centers of the world. They will be the beginning of the end of burning hydrocarbons.
    The powerful interests who control these industries today will fight viciously
    to stop this. There may even be wars to slow down this process as oil prices start
    to plummet and demand dries up.</p></li><li><p>Autonomous vehicles will continue
    to play a larger role in all aspects of war — from surveillance to troop/robot
    movement to logistics support to actual engagement. Drones will be complemented
    by additional on-the-ground, in-space, in-the-water and under-the-water autonomous
    vehicles.</p></li></ol><p>Note: My original article was inspired by a presentation

  :title: Eleven Reasons To Be Excited About The Future of Technology
  :content: '<p>“The strongest force propelling human progress has been the swift
    advance and wide diffusion of technology.” — The Economist</p><p>In the year 1820,
    a person could <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/">expect to
    live</a> less than 35 years, 94% of the global population <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-poverty/">lived
    in extreme poverty</a>, and less that 20% of the population was literate. Today,
    human life expectancy is over 70 years, less that 10% of the global population
    lives in extreme poverty, and <a href="http://www.oecd.org/statistics/How-was-life.pdf">over
    80% of people</a> are literate. These improvements are due mainly to advances
    in technology, beginning in the industrial age and continuing today in the information
    age.</p><p>There are many exciting new technologies that will continue to transform
    the world and improve human welfare. Here are eleven of them.</p><h2>1. Self-Driving
    Cars</h2><p>Self-driving cars exist today that are safer than human-driven cars
    in most driving conditions. Over the next 3–5 years they‘ll get even safer, and
    will begin to go mainstream.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*HfoJs9tCyyr6VeLvD45wyQ.gif"
    alt=""></p><p>The <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs358/en/">World
    Health Organization estimates</a> that 1.25 million people die from car-related
    injuries per year. Half of the deaths are pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists
    hit by cars. Cars are the leading cause of death for people ages 15–29 years old.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*SNGdeK4GNUhjL6wlh7sfJw.png" alt=""></p><p>Just
    as cars reshaped the world in the 20th century, so will self-driving cars in the
    21st century. In most cities, <a href="http://oldurbanist.blogspot.com.es/2011/12/we-are-25-looking-at-street-area.html">between
    20–30%</a> of usable space is taken up by parking spaces, and most cars are parked
    <a href="http://www.reinventingparking.org/2013/02/cars-are-parked-95-of-time-lets-check.html">about
    95%</a> of the time. Self-driving cars will be in almost continuous use (most
    likely hailed from a smartphone app), thereby dramatically reducing the need for
    parking. Cars will communicate with one another to avoid accidents and traffic
    jams, and riders will be able to spend commuting time on other activities like
    work, education, and socializing.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*k6w2wkkREpVeu9_cS2xxtg.png"

    hard on the supply side to make clean energy convenient and cost-effective.</p><p>Due
    to steady technological and manufacturing advances, the price of solar cells has
    <a href="http://www.saskwind.ca/wind-cost-decline/">dropped 99.5% since 1977</a>.
    Solar will soon be more cost efficient than fossil fuels. The cost of wind energy
    has also dropped to an all-time low, and in the last decade represented about
    a <a href="http://energy.gov/articles/top-10-things-you-didnt-know-about-wind-power">third

    Drones and Flying Cars</h2><blockquote><h1>“Roads? Where we’re going we don’t
    need… roads.” — Dr. Emmet Brown</h1></blockquote><p>GPS started out as a military
    technology but is now used to hail taxis, get mapping directions, and hunt Pokémon.
    Likewise, drones started out as a military technology, but are increasingly being
    used for a wide range of consumer and commercial applications.</p><p>For example,
    drones are being used to inspect critical infrastructure like bridges and power
    lines, to survey areas struck by natural disasters, and many other creative uses

    advances in the last decade, due to new algorithms and massive increases in data

    broad promise of AI is to liberate people from repetitive mental tasks the same
    way the industrial revolution liberated people from repetitive physical tasks.</p><blockquote><p>“If

    Kelly</a></p></blockquote><p>Some people worry that AI will destroy jobs. History
    has shown that while new technology does indeed eliminate jobs, it also creates
    new and better jobs to replace them. For example, with advent of the personal
    computer, the number of typographer jobs dropped, but the increase in graphic
    designer jobs more than made up for it.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*c_lt2s5TuSoOfmPb_Rv46w.png"

    away than new jobs that will be created. Today millions of people work as app

    intelligence, indoor farms have become viable alternatives to traditional outdoor

    Computerized Medicine</h2><p>Until recently, computers have only been at the periphery
    of medicine, used primarily for research and record keeping. Today, the combination
    of computer science and medicine is leading to a variety of breakthroughs.</p><p><img

    example, just fifteen years ago, it cost $3B to sequence a human genome. Today,
    the cost is about a thousand dollars and continues to drop. Genetic sequencing
    will soon be a routine part of medicine.</p><p>Genetic sequencing generates massive
    amounts of data that can be analyzed using powerful data analysis software. One
    application is analyzing <a href="http://a16z.com/2016/06/09/freenome/">blood
    samples</a> for early detection of cancer. Further genetic analysis can help determine
    the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/super-cheap-genome-sequencing-by-2020-2014-10">best
    course</a> of treatment.</p><p>Another application of computers to medicine is
    in prosthetic limbs. Here a young girl is using prosthetic hands she controls

    2016 is just the beginning of a new age of wonders. As futurist Kevin Kelly <a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/internet-still-beginning-its-kevin-kelly">says</a>:</p><blockquote><p>If
    we could climb into a time machine, journey 30 years into the future, and from
    that vantage look back to today, we’d realize that most of the greatest products
    running the lives of citizens in 2050 were not invented until after 2016. People
    in the future will look at their holodecks and wearable virtual reality contact
    lenses and downloadable avatars and AI interfaces and say, “Oh, you didn’t really
    have the internet” — or whatever they’ll call it — “back then.”So, the truth:
    Right now, today, in 2016 is the best time to start up. There has never been a
    better day in the whole history of the world to invent something. There has never
    been a better time with more opportunities, more openings, lower barriers, higher
    benefit/ risk ratios, better returns, greater upside than now. Right now, this
    minute. This is the moment that folks in the future will look back at and say,
    “Oh, to have been alive and well back then!”</p></blockquote>'

  :title: If You Feel Unsure About The Future, You Don’t Need More Inspiration, You
    Need Better Principles
  :content: '<p>Photo by Nicole Wolf on Unsplash</p><p>If you feel lost, or as though
    you don’t know where you want your life to go next, or worse, fear that everything
    you have built could come crashing down, you don’t need more inspiration. You
    don’t need more positive thinking. You do not need more Pinterest photos or aspirational
    quotes.</p><p>When you have money problems, you need money principles.</p><p>When
    you have relationship problems, you need relationship principles.</p><p>When you
    have work problems, you need work principles.</p><p>When you have life problems,
    you need life principles.</p><p>More money does not solve money problems. Different
    relationships do not solve relationship problems. New work does not solve work
    problems. Your future life will not solve your life problems.</p><p>This is because
    money does not make you good with money. Love does not make you love yourself.
    Relationships don’t make you good at relationships. Work doesn’t make you good
    at your job, or capable of work/life balance.</p><p>Problems don’t inherently
    make you a stronger person unless you change and adapt. <strong>The variable here
    is you. The common denominator is whether or not you shift your foundational perspective
    on the world, and how you behave within it.</strong></p><p>Let’s be very clear:
    Someone who makes $500K can be as seriously in debt and struggling as someone
    who makes $50K, and in fact, this happens more often than you would ever think.
    People who make less money are required to learn how to manage it better, and
    people who make more think they can eschew principles because of the quantity
    they are attaining.</p><p>You can screw up your dream relationship just as quickly
    as you can a hookup, because the way you relate to others is an issue with you,
    not something that shifts depending on whether or not you meet the most perfect
    person you never triggers or annoys you and relates to you with unconditional
    positive regard.</p><p>You can be just as unhappy in your ideal job, with your
    perfect hours, at your most desired pay rate, if you don’t know how to ration
    your time, or relate to others in your workplace, or move your career forward.
    People who are “living their dreams” and “following their passion” can be just
    as unhappy as people who are not.</p><p>If you don’t have principles, your life
    is not going to get better just because you envision and then try to create a
    new one. Those problems are only going to follow you, and get bigger as your life
    does.</p><h3>The good things that happen to us in life are like a magnifier. They
    show us where we still need to grow. True love shows us to ourselves. Money shows
    us to ourselves. Dream jobs show us to ourselves. The good, the bad, the desperately-needs-to-change-right-now.</h3><p>If
    you don’t have principles now, you won’t have them later. If you don’t have the
    money principle of living beneath your means, you won’t be able to do it when
    you have more money.</p><p>If you don’t have the relationship principle of not
    relying on others for your sense of self, it won’t magically resolve itself when
    you meet the “right person,” you’ll just sabotage that relationship, too.</p><h2>What
    is a principle?</h2><p>A principle is a fundamental truth that you can use to
    build the foundation of your life. A principle is not an opinion, or a belief.
    A principle is a matter of cause and effect.</p><p>Principles can become personal
    guidelines.</p><p>Some examples of money principles are the following: keep overhead
    costs low, get out and stay out of debt, live beneath your means, save for a rainy
    day.</p><p>Many financial experts advocate to prioritize debt repayment as the
    beginning of financial health. This is because one day of accrued interest probably
    own’t impact you that much. But 20 years will, to the tune of tens of thousands
    of dollars, if not more.</p><p>In the same way, one day of gained interest in
    investments won’t make a big difference. But 20 years will, to an even more significant
    margin.</p><h3>The point of having principles is that it shifts you from short-term
    survival to long-term thriving.</h3><p>Most things in our lives are governed by
    principles. Stephen Covey explains this well:</p><blockquote><p>Principles are
    a natural law like gravity. It’s different than a value. Values are subjective;
    principles are objective. Gravity… if you drop something, gravity controls.</p></blockquote><p>What
    this means is that if we are committed to the principle of eating good food each
    day, we will inevitably reap the benefit of better or improved health. If we write
    a sentence each day, we will inevitably write a book. If we commit to paying off
    a portion of our debts each month, we will inevitably pay them off. If we invest
    consistently and wisely, we will eventually see a return.</p><p>Our lives are
    governed by principles, as Benjamin Hardy explains:</p><blockquote><p>Most people
    cram for tests while in college. But can you cram if you’re a farmer? Can you
    forget to plant in the spring, slack-off all summer, and then work hard during
    the fall? Of course not. A farm is a natural system governed by principles.So
    are you.<em>The law of the harvest *is always in effect. What you plant, you must
    harvest. Furthermore, what you plant consistently overtime eventually yields a
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Compound-Effect-Darren-Hardy/dp/159315724X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1468940772&sr=8-1&keywords=the+compound+effect">*compounded
    </a></em>or exponential harvest.You often don’t experience the consequences of
    your actions immediately, which can be deceiving. If you smoked one cigarette,
    you probably wouldn’t get cancer. If you spent $10 on coffee just one day, it
    probably wouldn’t affect your financial life. However, overtime, these habits
    have drastic outcomes. It turns out, $10 daily over 50 years at 5% compounding
    interest becomes $816,000.</p></blockquote><p>When you make an investment, you
    don’t expect to see a return that day. In the same way, you can go to sleep feeling
    accomplished knowing that you chipped away at your future, just by adhering to
    your principles.</p><p>Little things, done repeatedly and over time, become the
    big things.</p><h2>Why is inspiration ineffective here?</h2><p>Inspiration can
    be misleading. Big dreams not backed by strategized plans are big flops waiting
    to happen.</p><p>Inspiration means you take a feeling and elaborate on it. You
    allow your mind to wander, you piece together pretty pictures and create an image
    of how you’d like your life to feel.</p><p>Principles are boring. They aren’t
    inspiring. They are the laws of nature.</p><p>Principles are not immediately gratifying.</p><p>They
    do not make us feel better right away.</p><p>That’s why we often reach for inspiration,
    but find it to be ineffective. This is because we get our minds and hearts set
    on a vague idea of what we think we want, without ever really evaluating whether
    or not we want to engage in the *daily work and effort *it would take to get there.</p><p>When
    we don’t pair inspiration with the principles it takes to achieve those dreams,
    we become more lost and disappointed than ever before.</p><h2>How do I start developing
    my own principles?</h2><p>Nobody is born with excellent principles, they are something
    that you learn.</p><p>However, there are many different principles in life, and
    really, some may contradict one another. That’s why it’s important to adopt your
    own, that fit your goals and your life.</p><p>Begin with this:</p><ul><li><p>What
    do you value?</p></li><li><p>What do you want to experience in your life?</p></li><li><p>What
    makes you uneasy or gives you anxiety?</p></li></ul><p>The answers could be something
    like this:</p><p>I value relationships, and so by principle, I am going to prioritize
    them when given the opportunity. Alternatively, by principle, I value honest and
    positive relationships, so I’m not going to be in dating limbo anymore, unless
    someone commits within a reasonable amount of time, I will regard their hesitation
    as a “no.”</p><p>Perhaps you value financial freedom, and so by principle, you
    are going to put your extra cash toward repaying debt or building savings or investments.
    Perhaps you value travel and freedom, and so by principle, you are going to start
    working for yourself and always prioritize being able to work remotely or make
    your own schedule.</p><p>When you are clear on what your principles are, you can
    build your life from a really genuine, healthy place. You can start working toward
    goals that support what you do and do not want to experience, that will make you
    the calmest and happiest version of yourself.</p><p>A good life is built from
    the inside out, and is based on a foundation of self-conduct and prioritization.
    It’s not as dreamy as a vision board, but it’s a lot more effective.</p>'

  :title: 'Blockchain Governance: Programming Our Future'
  :content: '<p>This post describes why blockchain governance design is one of the
    most important problems out there, its critical components, current approaches,
    potential future approaches, and concludes with suggestions for the community.</p><h3>Why
    Blockchain Governance Matters</h3><p>As with organisms, the most successful blockchains
    will be those that can best adapt to their environments. Assuming these systems
    need to evolve to survive, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">initial
    design</a> is important, but** over a long enough timeline, the mechanisms for
    change are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection">most</a>
    <a href="https://briankeng.com/2015/07/a-little-bit-of-slope/">important</a>.**</p><p>As
    a result, I believe <strong>governance is the most vital problem in the space.
    **Other fundamental problems like scalability are <a href="https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/funding-the-evolution-of-blockchains-87d160988481">arguably
    best approached</a> by using governance to set the right incentives for people
    to solve them.</strong> **Yet little research has gone into governance and it
    feels poorly understood.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2724/1*N7VAEAH8-_Sqxmy8_0bgNQ.png"
    alt="Evolutionary tree of life, from [Leonard Eisenberg](https://www.evogeneao.com/explore/tree-of-life-explorer)."><em>Evolutionary
    tree of life, from <a href="https://www.evogeneao.com/explore/tree-of-life-explorer">Leonard
    Eisenberg</a>.</em></p><p>Satoshi showed us the immense power of releasing a blockchain-based
    incentive structure into the world. A 9 page <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">whitepaper</a>
    spawned a $150bn cryptocurrency, a computer network <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5kfuxk/how_powerful_is_the_bitcoin_network/">bigger
    than the top 500 supercomputers by 10,000x</a>, and a diverse ecosystem of developers,
    users, and companies. This was arguably one of the highest leverage actions in
    human history. It showed the power of blockchains as networks that can connect
    everyone and bootstrap themselves into existence if well constructed.</p><p>We
    are increasingly living in digital networks, spending an average of <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends">11
    hours a day on screens</a> in the US with over half of that on internet connected
    devices, growing 11% each year. However, these networks are highly centralized
    (Facebook, Google, Apple, Twitter) and <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/01/04/google-facebook-ad-industry/">continue
    to consolidate</a>. In the current model, all of the profit and power of a network
    is within one company, and you’re either inside or you’re outside. It’s important
    the networks we live in serve our best interests. With blockchains emerging as
    the new global infrastructure, <strong>we have the opportunity to create vastly
    different power structures and program the future we want for ourselves.</strong></p><p>For
    these reasons, I believe <strong>blockchain governance system design is one of
    the highest leverage activities known.</strong></p><h3>A Cambrian Explosion</h3><p>It’s
    rare a new government or central bank gets created, and even more rare to see
    experimentation with a new form of governance when it does.</p><p>Blockchains
    are unique because they 1) allow thousands of governance systems and monetary
    policies to be tried at the speed of software with 2) in some cases, much lower
    consequences of failure. As a result, *<em>there will be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion">Cambrian
    explosion</a> of economic and governance designs *</em>where many approaches will
    be tried in parallel at hyperspeed. To be clear, I am including economic design
    and monetary policy (said another way, incentive structure) in governance because,
    like other aspects of the system, they can be modified as time passes.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2374/1*SDRcq6gCVc4TcI5YUnrY3g.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>Many
    of these attempts will be spectacular failures. With millions of algorithmic central
    banks we will have millions of crypto <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Wednesday">George
    Soroses trying to break the Bank of England</a>. Through this process, <strong>blockchains
    may teach us more about governance in the next 10 years than we have learned from
    the “real world” in the last 100 years.</strong></p><h3>Two Critical Components
    of Governance</h3><p><strong>1. Incentives</strong></p><p>Each group in the system
    has their own incentives.** **Those incentives are not always 100% aligned with
    all other groups in the system. Groups will propose changes over time which are
    <a href="https://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/natural-progress-things-spurious-quotation">advantageous
    for them</a>. Organisms are biased towards their own survival. This commonly manifests
    in changes to the reward structure, monetary policy, or balances of power.</p><p><strong>2.
    Mechanisms for coordination</strong></p><p>Since it’s unlikely all groups have
    100% incentive alignment at all times, the ability for each group to coordinate
    around their common incentives is critical for them to affect change. If one group
    can coordinate better than another it creates power imbalances in their favor.</p><p>In
    practice, a major factor is how much coordination can be done on-chain vs. off-chain,
    where on-chain coordination makes coordinating easier. In some new blockchains,
    on-chain coordination allows the rules or even the ledger history itself to be
    changed.</p><h3>Current Approaches</h3><p>What follows is a dissection of the
    benefits and drawbacks of today’s two largest blockchains: Bitcoin and Ethereum.
    We are currently in the primordial ooze phase of blockchain governance. Systems
    are simple and little has been tried.</p><h3>Bitcoin</h3><p>Bitcoin was the first
    successful attempt to create a standalone blockchain. Let’s examine it as a base:</p><p><strong>1.
    Incentives</strong></p><ul><li><p>Developers: increase value of existing token
    holdings, social recognition, maintain power for control over future direction.</p></li><li><p>Miners:
    increase value of existing token holdings, expected future block rewards, and
    expected future transactions fees.</p></li><li><p>Users: increase value of existing
    token holdings, increase functional utility (e.g. store of value, uncensorable
    transactions, file storage).</p></li></ul><p><strong>2. Mechanisms for coordination</strong></p><p>Mostly
    off-chain. Developers coordinate through the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (<a
    href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Improvement_Proposals">BIPs</a>) process
    and a <a href="https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev-moderation/">mailing
    list</a>. Miners can coordinate on-chain in the sense that they are creating the
    chain itself.</p><p><strong>Resulting system</strong></p><p>The <strong>checks
    and balances system created is somewhat analogous to the US government</strong>
    and has a number of benefits. Similar to the Senate submitting new bills, developers
    submit pull requests. Similar to the judiciary, miners decide whether or not to
    actually adopt the laws in practice. Similar to the executive branch, the nodes
    of the network can veto by not running a version which aligns with what the miners
    are running. And similar to citizens, the users can revolt. Finally, economic
    incentives dictate that it is in everyone’s best interest to maintain trust in
    the system. For example: if miners alienated all the users, the tokens would decrease
    in value and they would go out of business. <strong>As the first system of its
    kind, it’s incredible that Bitcoin is still going strong.</strong></p><p><img

    as branches of US Government. Image from [Buck Perley](https://medium.com/@BuckPerley/crypto-governance-f1318affbbe0)."><em>Bitcoin
    as branches of US Government. Image from <a href="https://medium.com/@BuckPerley/crypto-governance-f1318affbbe0">Buck
    Perley</a>.</em></p><p>There are risks to the system caused by asymmetries in
    incentives. Miners push for changes which increase future cumulative transaction
    fees, while developers don’t care as long as the value of Bitcoin keeps going
    up. Developers’ direct economic incentives are weak. New developers have little
    incentive to work on Bitcoin because there is no direct way to earn money by doing
    it. As a result, they often work on new projects — either by creating Ethereum
    tokens, entirely new chains, or companies. No new blood entering increases the
    perception and reality of early developers as the most knowledgable and experienced.
    This <a href="https://medium.com/@BuckPerley/crypto-governance-f1318affbbe0">results</a>
    in <strong>a self-reinforcing cycle of more power becoming concentrated in a small
    group of early core developers, slower technological advancement, and conservatism</strong>.
    Developers are at risk of being bribed since they have a lot of power but weak
    economic incentives. Some <a href="http://chaincode.com/">early holders</a> and
    <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/gavin-andresen-core-developers-join-mits-digital-currency-initiative-1429743725/">universities</a>
    have sponsored developers, but with limited impact thus far.</p><p>Similarly,
    asymmetries in ability to coordinate give miners disproportionate power. Communication
    amongst miners is easier because they are a small and concentrated group. Since
    mining is a business with economies of scale, we’d expect <strong>a continued
    trend towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly">natural
    monopoly</a> in mining</strong> and even greater coordination advantage. As a
    reference point, <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CVhkEhtUAAAl0LH.jpg">95%
    of mining power was able to sit on one small stage</a> 2 years ago. Miners can
    also gain disproportionate power by bribing developers or hiring their own. Finally,
    the checks and balances system of Bitcoin relies on some level of transparency:
    for example, users becoming aware of a single miner gaining more than 51% of the
    hashing power or developers having some level of independence. And a miner who
    was able to gain &gt;51% of hashing power would be incented to remain anonymous.
    Rather than sparking a specific catastrophic event, this would cause an unknowing
    descent into a centralized world of control through censorship and asset freezing.</p><h3>Ethereum</h3><p>The
    systemic incentives and mechanisms of coordination in Ethereum are similar to
    Bitcoin at the moment.</p><p>Dynamics will change as Ethereum <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/">moves
    to proof of stake</a>. The power of miners will be replaced by anyone who holds
    a sufficient amount of Ether to run a virtual miner (a “validator”). This is especially
    true as solutions like <a href="https://1protocol.com">1protocol</a> will allow
    even the smallest Ether holder to participate, <strong>flattening the distinction
    between a miner and a user, and potentially reducing the biggest centralization
    risk in Bitcoin.</strong></p><p>The incentives of core developers remain the same.
    Coordination around challenging issues has been swifter and smoother than in Bitcoin
    to date. This is due to 1) a culture more open to change because <a href="https://coinjournal.net/vitalik-buterin-early-versions-ethereum-supposed-launch-bitcoin/">Ethereum
    was created as a reaction to what could not be done in a rigid Bitcoin environment</a>
    and 2) direction from Vitalik who is widely trusted in the community.</p><p>Current
    weaknesses in the model include 1) over reliance on its creator (Vitalik) and
    2) like Bitcoin, limited ways to incentivize core development, forcing more projects
    to create tokens to support themselves. Vitalik is <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/928172344631115776">making
    a conscious effort to step back</a>, which will be a delicate process.</p><h3>New
    Chains Experimenting with On-Chain Governance</h3><p>New blockchains are making
    it much easier to coordinate by enabling on-chain governance.</p><p><strong>Tezos</strong></p><p>In
    <a href="https://www.tezos.com/">Tezos</a>, <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-is-Tezos-different-from-Ethereum?share=d5c26090&srid=OAAh">anyone
    can submit a change to the governance structure</a> in the form of a code update.
    An on-chain vote occurs, and if passed, the update makes its way on to a test
    network. After a period of time on the test network, a confirmation vote occurs,
    at which point the change goes live on the main network. They call this concept
    a “self-amending ledger”.</p><p>Such a system is interesting because <strong>it
    shifts power towards users and away from the more centralized group of developers
    and miners.</strong> On the developer side, anyone can submit a change, and most
    importantly, everyone has an economic incentive to do it. Contributions are rewarded
    by the community with newly minted tokens through <a href="https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/funding-the-evolution-of-blockchains-87d160988481">inflation
    funding</a>. This shifts from the current Bitcoin and Ethereum dynamics where
    a new developer has little incentive to evolve the protocol, thus power tends
    to concentrate amongst the existing developers, to one where everyone has equal
    earning power.</p><p>This also enables users to directly coordinate on-chain,
    dramatically increasing their power and reducing the power of miners compared
    to a system like Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2130/1*sKjsh_IrxHvST_aZbaGk_g.png"
    alt=""></p><p><strong>DFINITY</strong></p><p>One step further would be a system
    which allows on-chain votes to the rules of the system like Tezos <em>and</em>
    <a href="https://medium.com/dfinity/the-dfinity-blockchain-nervous-system-a5dd1783288e">direct,
    retroactive changes to the ledger itself</a>. In other words, if something happens
    that tokenholders do not like (ex: a hack, a marketplace selling drugs), they
    can <strong>roll back or edit the ledger in addition to the rules of governance
    themselves</strong>. <a href="https://dfinity.org">DFINITY</a>, an in-development
    blockchain, is taking this approach. Proponents of this system point to events
    like hard fork caused by The DAO hack and the recent <a href="https://paritytech.io/blog/security-alert.html">$150m
    Parity multi-sig bug</a> and suggest such events would be much smoother if everyone
    could just vote to undo them. On the flip side, this system allows direct censorship
    and peoples’ tokens to be forcibly taken. As we saw with Ethereum’s hard fork
    to revert The DAO hack, this is possible with existing blockchains, but requires
    higher friction through off-chain coordination and hard forking instead of on-chain
    coordination with no forking.</p><p>DFINITY is maximally flexible. Depending on
    what parts of the protocol Tezos allows to be changed, it is possible protocol
    changes effectively let you re-write the ledger as in DFINITY. As a result, it’s
    likely these systems will have different voting thresholds for different changes,
    perhaps requiring a supermajority for some things and a simple majority for others.</p><h3>The
    Double-Edged Sword of On-Chain Governance</h3><p>On-chain governance is a double
    edged sword. On the upside it helps make sure a process is consistently followed
    which can increase coordination and fairness. It also allows for quicker decision
    making. On the downside it’s risky because the metasystem becomes harder to change
    once instituted. Like anything put directly into code, *<em>it can be exploited
    or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic">gamed</a> more quickly and easily
    if flawed. *</em>Vlad Zamfir, a principal architect of Ethereum’s proof of stake,
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RtSod8EXn4&feature=youtu.be&t=2h33m39s">feels</a>
    “the risks far outweigh the rewards” and “represent an extremely risky proposition”.</p><p>For
    some use cases, tending towards being static may be good. This may be especially
    true for store of value. <strong>Perhaps lower level protocols should lean toward
    stasis and conservatism — “measure twice and cut once” — while higher level protocols
    should be more flexible — “move fast and break things”.</strong> In the words
    of Calvin Coolidge: <a href="https://coolidgefoundation.org/blog/kill-bad-bills/">“it
    is much more important to kill bad bills than to pass good ones”</a>. Like established
    companies, some of the more established protocols may be able to watch what new
    protocols do and adopt techniques which seem to be working. This seems especially
    true of Ethereum which has shown a willingness to hard fork and the ability to
    maintain network value through them. Consequently, I’d expect to see the most
    innovation in the next few years from Ethereum tokens and entirely new chains.</p><p>It’s
    probable we haven’t found the best governance systems yet, which means a more
    general system which allows many different methods to be tried is valuable, if
    for nothing more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic">learning</a>.
    <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory">A more complex system
    can simulate less complex ones, but the reverse is generally hard.</a></p><p>The
    most interesting learnings will come from exploring the balance of mutability
    so systems can evolve and immutability for stability.</p><h3>Future Approaches</h3><p>Next
    we’ll talk about future governance strategies with potential which have yet to
    be tried.</p><p><strong>Futarchy</strong></p><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futarchy">futarchy</a>,
    <strong>society defines its values and then prediction markets are used to decide
    what actions will maximize those values</strong>. Said another <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/21/introduction-futarchy/">way</a>:
    <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/%7Erhanson/futarchy.html">“vote on values, bet on
    beliefs”</a>. It was <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/%7Erhanson/futarchy2000.pdf">originally
    proposed</a> in 2000 by <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/bio">Robin Hanson</a>,
    an economics professor at George Mason University.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Merkle">Ralph
    Merkle</a> has a particularly eye-opening proposal for a blockchain implementation
    of futarchy in his paper called <a href="http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf">DAOs,
    Democracy, and Governance</a>. In his proposal, every citizen is polled once a
    year and asked the question “how satisfied were you this year on a scale of 0
    to 1?”. Averaged together, these give an overall societal welfare score. A prediction
    market on this welfare score is developed for every year for the next 100 years,
    where traders can speculate on the welfare score for any year into the future.
    An overall future welfare score is then created by averaging the scores for the
    next 100 years, weighting earlier years more than future years. When a new bill
    is introduced, there is a 1 week period where markets speculate on whether the
    overall welfare score will go up or down if the bill is passed. If the bill is
    passed, the traders who bet on the overall welfare going up now own the overall
    welfare contracts they bet on. They will make money if they are right and lose
    money if they are wrong.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ckQP_t0rBlgVJMIvK_jmtg.png"
    alt="Example of futarchy for deciding whether or not to fire a CEO where the value
    to maximize is revenue. Image from [ConsenSys](https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/markets-for-the-future-c73fa73fe35d)."><em>Example
    of futarchy for deciding whether or not to fire a CEO where the value to maximize
    is revenue. Image from <a href="https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/markets-for-the-future-c73fa73fe35d">ConsenSys</a>.</em></p><p>This
    system could be incredibly powerful for a few reasons. First, voting becomes extremely
    simple. People don’t need to vote, they are just asked about one thing once a
    year: their satisfaction. Second, people do not need to develop extensive knowledge
    of candidates or bills. This is important because candidates are often persuasive
    and bills are complex to the point where it is hard for a domain-specific researcher
    to understand their implications, let alone an elected official or an average
    citizen. Instead, we rely on the wisdom of the markets. Like trading in stocks,
    only people who are extremely well informed on a topic will bet on it — otherwise
    they are likely to lose money to others who are better informed. Finally, it is
    a system where <strong>market incentives are aligned with societal values.</strong></p><p>In
    futarchy the devil is in the implementation details. <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2016/07/merkles-futarchy.html">Hard
    problems include</a> the governance metaproblem of how to decide on the societal
    value(s) to maximize in the first place and making sure people aren’t incented
    to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbard%E2%80%93Satterthwaite_theorem">tactically
    vote</a> an extreme satisfaction score of 0 or 1 to swing policy.</p><p><strong>Setting
    goal functions is both important and tricky, as there are always unforeseen consequences.</strong>
    For example, in the case of capitalism, this can manifest in rising wealth inequality
    and environmental externalities. In the case of artificial intelligence, this
    can manifest in <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Wireheading">wireheading</a>
    or rapidly maximizing something at the unexpected expense of other things, commonly
    illustrated through the example of a <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer">paperclip
    maximizer</a> which destroys everything to build as many paperclips as possible.
    These are serious concerns, as I believe <a href="https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/912388216396824576">the
    most powerful AIs will be bootstrapped into existence on the blockchain</a> by
    using tokenized incentives for everyone to feed them the best data and algorithms.
    If this is true, blockchain governance is the largest determinant of our future
    trajectory as a species. More on this in a future post.</p><p><strong>Liquid Democracy</strong></p><p><a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy">Liquid democracy</a>
    is system where everyone has the ability to vote themselves, to delegate their
    vote to someone else, and to remove the delegation of their vote at any time.
    In the U.S. we do not have a liquid democracy because we cannot vote on many bills
    directly (our representatives do that for us) and once we elect a representative,
    they are typically in office for 4 years.</p><p>This seems like it will be used
    in proof of stake blockchains given its simplicity.</p><p><strong>Quadratic Voting</strong></p><p><a
    href="http://ericposner.com/quadratic-voting/">Quadratic voting</a> is a system
    of buying votes, where each additional vote costs twice as much as the one before
    it. In other words, money buys votes, but with strong diminishing returns. <a
    href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4rtpmm/on_coinlock_voting_futarchy_and_optimal/">Vitalik
    proposed</a> a variant on this he calls “quadratic coin lock voting” where N coins
    let you make N * k votes by locking up those coins for a time period of k². This
    is a nice modification because it aligns incentives over time: more voting power
    requires living with your decisions for longer. In a tokenized world with little
    friction of entering or leaving a community, this is especially important.</p><h3>Voting
    with People or Money?</h3><p>A major problem with one person = one vote systems
    on the blockchain is their susceptibility to sybil attacks. Near zero cost to
    create infinite accounts means it’s easy to generate infinite votes. This is why
    the default model in proof of stake and Ethereum-based token governance is one
    token = one vote.</p><p>Blockchain-based identity systems like <a href="https://www.civic.com/">Civic</a>
    can help enable one person = one vote systems. However, anonymity is likely to
    be preserved in most cryptocurrencies. Identity gives each coin its own unique
    history, which can be subjectively judged to be more or less clean than that of
    another coin, causing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility">fungibility</a>
    to break down. One potential approach is a balance between identity and money:
    a fully verified identity gets 100% of the voting power of their money, a partially
    verified identity gets 50%, and an entirely anonymous identity gets 25%.</p><p>As
    mentioned in quadratic voting, other mechanisms which weight community members
    differently independent of real-world identity are likely to evolve. For example,
    a new token holder may have diminished voting power until they have been a member
    of the community for a while, similar to not being able to vote until you are
    a full citizen of a country.</p><p>In any case, <strong>today’s world would look
    a lot different if modern governments ran on voting with money, so this change
    in defaults is not to be taken lightly.</strong></p><p>Finally,** reputation within
    a token community will be critical.** This is already shown through indirect means,
    where Vitalik’s suggestions carry a lot of weight in the Ethereum community. In
    a liquid democracy system reputation manifests in the number of votes delegated
    to a particular person. Someone with high reputation and no money could have 10
    million Ether delegated to them and have tremendous governing power.</p><h3>Other
    Tools</h3><p>Simple <strong>off-chain futures markets have already shown themselves
    as a powerful tool</strong>. In the recently proposed and contentious Bitcoin
    <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/explainer-what-is-segwit2x-and-what-does-it-mean-for-bitcoin/">SegWit2x</a>
    fork, futures markets speculated on the expected value of SegWit2x vs. non-SegWit2x
    chains. The markets consistently valued a SegWit2x chain <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/75xncv/2x_futures_prices_drops_below_02_btc/">at
    less than 20%</a> of a non-SegWit2x chain for 3 weeks. Supporters of SegWit2x
    then <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html">called
    off</a> their forking efforts because they felt they had “not built sufficient
    consensus”. While it’s hard to know exactly what caused them to reach this conclusion,
    it seems like futures markets were a strong indicator of lack of support.</p><p><img

    markets on Bitcoin’s SegWit2x"><em>Futures markets on Bitcoin’s SegWit2x</em></p><p>Other
    tools are being built for governance and standardization at different layers.
    <a href="https://zeppelinos.org/">ZeppelinOS</a> is <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity">a
    series of basic libraries</a> which are commonly being used as the base of Ethereum
    token systems, covering things like token sale mechanics, token vesting, and access
    controls to the treasury of the project. <a href="http://aragon.one">Aragon</a>
    is trying to create standard implementations of these systems in the same way
    Delaware C corporations implement corporations in a standard way.</p><h3>Forking</h3><p>It’s
    worth noting that forking is always an option. Applying Albert Hirschman’s classic
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty">voice or exit</a>
    paradigm for affecting change in a system, <strong>voice is governance, weak exit
    is selling your coins, and strong exit is forking.</strong></p><p>We’ve seen many
    examples of forking so far, and this is great! In physical nations forking is
    nearly impossible. This was also the case in software until blockchains emerged.
    They make it easy to take all the code and state of a system and try a new path.
    In the Web 2.0 world,** forking is the equivalent of Facebook allowing any competitor
    to take their entire database and codebase to a competitor. **Don’t like how Facebook
    is operating it’s newsfeed? Create a fork with all the same code, social connections,
    and photos.</p><p><strong>The ability to fork significantly reduces lock-in and
    increases diversity</strong>, allowing many <a href="https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/accelerating-evolution-through-forking-6b0bba85a2ba">more
    paths</a> to be tried than we would ever see in modern governments, central banks,
    or Web 2.0 companies. As in <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spinoff.asp">corporate
    spinoffs</a>, forking is also beneficial when two niche chains can more effectively
    serve distinct needs than one chain ineffectively serving both sets of needs.</p><p>However,
    it is still valuable to avoid hard forks when possible. A <a href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/9173/what-is-a-hard-fork">hard
    fork</a> is a non-backwards compatible change. Downsides of hard forks include:</p><ol><li><p>Reducing
    network effects. Not everyone is speaking the same language anymore.</p></li><li><p>Creating
    work. Anyone who was using the forked protocol probably had their code broken.
    In a world that is increasingly interconnected through transparent and trustless
    code execution, these effects compound.</p></li><li><p>Reducing trust. Now that
    we’ve had a breaking change, those previously referencing the protocol must now
    go outside the blockchain and somehow figure out what the “right” new version
    is to use.</p></li></ol><p>Because of the dramatically reduced friction for exit,
    the need for effective voice (governance) is more critical than ever. It is trivial
    to fork a blockchain and copy all of its code and state. So <strong>the value
    isn’t in the chain of data, it’s in the community and social consensus around
    a chain</strong>. Governance is what keeps communities together and, in turn,
    gives a token value.</p><h3>Community Suggestions</h3><p><strong>For users:</strong>
    Spend more time looking at the governance system of your blockchain, less time
    on the issue of the day. <strong>Current events are just a manifestation of the
    larger system that caused them.</strong> So while it’s easy to get riled up by
    the news, the highest leverage point for change comes from designing or changing
    the system, not arguing about its current manifestations.</p><p><strong>For developers:</strong>
    Try <a href="https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/funding-the-evolution-of-blockchains-87d160988481">inflation
    funding</a>. And if you are creating a new token using a simple 1 token = 1 vote
    system, <strong>consider quadratic coin lock voting</strong> as a low risk/high
    return alternative.</p><p><strong>For everyone:</strong> Watch and learn from
    the experiments that will be run on the new on-chain governance systems.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Like
    organisms, the ability of a blockchain to succeed over time is based on its ability
    to evolve. This evolution will bring about many decisions on direction, and it
    is the governance around those decisions which most strongly determine the outcome
    of the system. <strong>If programming in the system is important, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a>
    of the system itself is most important.</strong></p><p><strong>I believe governance
    should be the primary focus of investors in the space.</strong> The fundamentals
    of cryptoeconomics and overarching governance schemas of these networks are critical
    to survival, under-appreciated, and poorly understood. Investors can add significant
    value through the luxury of being able to observe and learn from multiple projects
    at one time.** **They should be active in the governance of the tokens they participate
    in and transparent with a community if they feel the design of the system can
    be improved.</p><p><strong>We are birthing into existence systems which transcend
    us.</strong> In the same way democracy and capitalism as systems determine so

  :title: 7 Modern Life Habits That Can Be Incredibly Bad For Your Brain Health
  :content: '<p>Lifestyle habits that influence your cognitive health and what to
    do about them</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3968/1*7zisdYgxVntRV9ff3mdCbw.png"
    alt="Image from [rawpixel.com](http://rawpixel.com/)"><em>Image from <a href="http://rawpixel.com/">rawpixel.com</a></em></p><p>In
    an era of better technology, we are all being rewired to do more to the detriment
    of our brains. According to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/mind/7-everyday-ways-you-are-ruining-your-iq/">experts</a>,
    our modern lifestyle is chipping away at neural pathways and making us slower,
    denser and less capable of original thought. Hyperconnectivity is increasingly
    taking its toll on our brains. In the end, we end up less productive and ineffective.</p><p>When
    it comes to our health, we don’t always think about nurturing our brains the way
    we nourish our bodies. But to be our most productive self, we need to do more
    of what improves our brain health, and less of what causes cognitive decline.
    Start by adjusting your daily habits and avoiding these common modern habits —
    your mind will thank you.</p><h3>1. The brain drain of inactivity</h3><p>Physical
    inactivity has its price tags — It’s linked to the development of chronic health
    problems like heart disease, obesity, depression, dementia, and cancer. Many people
    are too busy to make time for “basic movement activities” that can slow cognitive
    decline — walking, cycling, stretching, etc.</p><p>Being sedentary changes the
    shape of certain neurons in the brain, according to a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24114875">new
    study</a> in the *Journal of Comparative Neurology *that suggests a link between
    inactivity and mental decline.</p><p>Regular physical activity can benefit you
    cognitively — increase brain chemicals which promote better memory and learning,
    and medically. You know this though. Knowledge of the benefits of exercise is
    not a problem in the modern world, it’s the application of relevant information.</p><h3>2.
    Think you’re multitasking? Think again</h3><p>Our smartphones have become Swiss
    army knives. We use them all the time. We text while we’re walking across the
    street, catch up on email while commuting, read or listen to podcasts while standing
    in a queue.</p><p>You’ve likely heard that multitasking is bad for your productivity.
    It turns out, it’s a habit that also rewires the brain and makes you less effective.</p><p>Earl
    Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT and one of the world experts on divided attention,
    says that our brains are “not wired to multitask well… When people think they’re
    multitasking, they’re actually just switching from one task to another very rapidly.
    And every time they do, there’s a cognitive cost in doing so.”</p><p>Multitasking
    also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/18/modern-world-bad-for-brain-daniel-j-levitin-organized-mind-information-overload">increases</a>
    the stress hormone cortisol as well as the fight-or-flight hormone adrenaline,
    which can overstimulate your brain and cause mental fog or scrambled thinking.</p><h3>3.
    Information overload leads to unnecessary overstimulation of the brain</h3><p>The
    sheer volume of emails, social updates, and notifications we receive can be overwhelming
    — it takes a huge bite out of the day for many people. The constant stream of
    content if not managed can cause stress and lead to decision overload.</p><p>“Too
    Much Information” that, “Information overload is one of the biggest irritations
    in modern life”, <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2011/06/30/too-much-information">writes</a>
    Schumpeter of <em>The Economist.</em></p><p>Some people proudly boast of how many
    things they can juggle in a single day. Glenn Wilson, former visiting professor
    of psychology at Gresham College, London <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/18/modern-world-bad-for-brain-daniel-j-levitin-organized-mind-information-overload">found</a>
    out in his research that being in a situation where you are trying to concentrate
    on a task, and an email is sitting unread in your inbox, can reduce your effective
    IQ by 10 points.</p><p>To maximize your brain every day, use better tools and
    settings to filter information throughout the day. Be proactive about how you
    consume media. Prepare your brain to ignore unnecessary information. When you
    organize your day with these principles in mind, you will likely increase your
    brain’s efficiency significantly.</p><h3>4. Sitting for too long is hurting you</h3><p>Sitting
    is one of the worst things we can do for our health. A new UCLA <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195549">study</a>
    reports that people who are more sedentary have thinning in brain regions linked
    to memory.</p><p>It finds that sitting isn’t just a physical health risk — it’s
    a neurological risk as well. The authors <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195549">write</a>
    in their paper, “it is possible that sedentary behaviour is a more significant
    predictor of brain structure, specifically [medial temporal lobe] thickness, and
    that physical activity, even at higher levels, is not sufficient to offset the
    harmful effects of sitting for extended periods of time.”</p><p>You can reduce
    the amount of sitting you do by adopting interventions like moderate walking,
    standing while working, even for just 10 minutes at a time, standup meetings —
    it offers the opportunity to sit less, move more and conduct short meetings.</p><h3>5.
    All that screen time can negatively impact our mental and emotional wellbeing</h3><p>Today,
    face-to-face interactions are increasingly being replaced by digital tools. People
    spend more time online than ever before.</p><p>“Anything with a screen — television,
    phones, tablets, computers, video games — constitutes screen time,” explains Tom
    Kersting, a licensed psychotherapist and an expert in the field of mental health
    and parenting in the digital age. “If the majority of our waking hours entails
    looking at a screen, then we know it is way too much.”</p><p>A face-to-face conversation
    is incredibly beneficial for your brain. A <a href="https://news.umich.edu/ten-minutes-of-talking-has-a-mental-payoff/">study
    </a>by the University of Michigan found that even just 10 minutes per day of conversation
    with another person improved memory and cognition.</p><p>“In our study, socializing
    was just as effective as more traditional kinds of mental exercise in boosting
    memory and intellectual performance,” said Oscar Ybarra, a psychologist at the
    U-M Institute for Social Research (ISR) and a lead author of the study with ISR
    psychologist Eugene Burnstein and psychologist Piotr Winkielman from the University
    of California, San Diego.</p><p>The lack of true personal interaction limits the
    brain’s opportunities to make better connections. It can also lead to loneliness
    and depression — mental conditions that contribute significantly to reduced brain
    health.</p><p>Looking at screens all day can hurt your eyes, ears, neck, shoulders,
    back, wrists, and forearms. It also interferes with getting a good night’s sleep.</p><p>According
    to <a href="https://aaptiv.com/magazine/ways-screen-time-impacts-health">experts</a>,
    excessive screen time has a negative effect on intellectual abilities as well
    as emotional well-being.</p><p>Set clear boundaries with screens to avoid developing
    detrimental habits. The goal isn’t to avoid screen time entirely, as that’s not
    realistic in modern life. However, if you’re going to use a device, be mindful.</p><h3>6.
    It’s surprisingly easy for your headphones to damage the parts of the ear vital
    to healthy hearing</h3><p>People, by nature, love to switch up the volume. It
    makes the music sounds more “fun” and immersive. In the age of noise-cancelling
    earbuds and headphones, you can easily damage your hearing.</p><p>When the rest
    of the world gets too distracting, it’s tempting to pop in your earbuds, crank
    up your favourite tunes, and close yourself off to focus better.</p><p>If you
    consistently blast your music too loudly, you can damage your hearing. But it’s
    not just your ears: Hearing loss in older adults is linked to brain problems,
    such as Alzheimer’s and loss of brain tissue.</p><p>When your brain has to work
    so hard to understand what’s being said around you, it can’t store what you’ve
    heard into memory. So, protect your hearing by adjusting the volume of your headphones
    — it’s an excellent way to preserve your hearing and allow your brain to work
    better.</p><p>“One test we recommend is to remove your headphones, keeping them
    at your preferred volume, and hold them out in front of you at an arm’s length.
    Can you hear the music clearly? If so, try turning it down and repeating again,”
    writes <em>Headphonesty</em>. Always aim to take regular breaks during the course
    of the day to give your ears a much-needed rest.</p><h3>7. Sleeping poorly upsets
    your brain</h3><p>Insufficient sleep is a huge problem for many busy professionals.
    Sleep deprivation can have serious short-term and long-term consequences — it
    can delay reaction times, glucose levels, mood, headache, impaired memory, and
    hormone imbalances. Recent <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/09/04/health/no-sleep-brain-size/index.html">research</a>
    shows that not getting enough sleep may actually shrink your brain.</p><p>Sleep
    is absolutely essential for your brain. When you deprive your brain healthy sleep,
    how it process information, consolidates memories, make connections, and clear
    out toxins suffers.</p><p>Lack of sleep slows down your thinking, impairs your
    memory, concentration, judgment, and decision-making, and impedes learning.</p><p>Improving
    your sleep habits could be an important way to improve brain health. 7–8 hours/night
    of good sleep is essential for stimulating new connections and brain growth.</p><p>If
    you are concerned about the health of your brain and the quality of your thinking
    now or in the future, learn to take care of your brain. A few simple changes to
    your lifestyle could boost your memory, learning, mental resilience and overall
    health of your brain.</p>'

    you want to be as healthy as possible, there are no treadmills or weight machines
    required.</p><p>Don’t just take my word for it — look to the longest-lived people
    in the world for proof.</p><p>People in the world’s <a href="http://time.com/5160475/blue-zones-healthy-long-lives/">Blue
    Zones</a>— the places around the world with the highest life expectancy — <a href="https://www.bluezones.com/2016/11/power-9/">don’t
    pump iron, run marathons or join gyms</a><em>.</em></p><p>Instead, they live in
    environments that constantly nudge them into moving without even thinking about
    it. This means that they grow gardens, walk throughout the day, and minimize mechanical
    conveniences for house and yard work.</p><p>In fact, Blue Zones researchers determined
    that routine natural movement is one of the most impactful ways to increase your
    life span, and a common habit among the world’s longest-lived populations.</p><p>Of
    course this might not seem realistic in our current knowledge economy, where we’re
    often tied to a desk and in front of a computer screen all day.</p><p>Moving naturally
    throughout the day might sound pleasant and romantic, but the reality is that
    100 years ago only 10% of us had sedentary jobs, whereas today it’s 90%.</p><p>However,
    there are still easy ways to add more movement into your busy lifestyle.</p><p>One
    of the best ways to do this is to use an active mode of transportation. This could
    mean walking your kids to school, walking or biking to the grocery store, to a
    friend’s house, or out to dinner.</p><p>Ideally you could walk or bike to work
    as well (or walk/bike to the bus or train station, if that’s more feasible).</p><p>Research
    shows that the <a href="http://www.andrewmerle.com/blog/2017/9/10/the-ideal-work-commute-will-make-you-happier-and-healthier">best
    work commute you can have is a 15-minute walk each way</a>, but any physical activity
    built in along your commute is a plus. On the flip side, the <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/10/19/141514467/small-changes-can-help-you-thrive-happily">daily
    car commute is the number two thing Americans hate the most on a daily basis</a>,
    behind only housework (but maybe housework would be more enjoyable if you reminded
    yourself of the life-extending natural movement involved!).</p><p>If active transportation
    isn’t possible in your community, you can still find time to go out for a walk.</p><p>A
    recent study from the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/study-even-a-little-walking-may-help-you-live-longer.html">American
    Cancer Society</a> revealed that walking for six hours per week resulted in a
    lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer
    than not being active at all. But the research also showed that walking even as
    little as two hours per week could reduce the risk of disease and help you live
    longer.</p><p><a href="http://www.andrewmerle.com/blog/2017/9/24/this-is-how-to-exercise-to-sharpen-your-mind">Walking

    alt=""></p><p><strong>In his backpack,</strong> Wouter Slotboom, 34, carries around
    a small black device, slightly larger than a pack of cigarettes, with an antenna
    on it. I meet Wouter by chance at a random cafe in the center of Amsterdam. It
    is a sunny day and almost all the tables are occupied. Some people talk, others
    are working on their laptops or playing with their smartphones.</p><p>Wouter removes
    his laptop from his backpack, puts the black device on the table, and hides it
    under a menu. A waitress passes by and we ask for two coffees and the password
    for the WiFi network. Meanwhile, Wouter switches on his laptop and device, launches
    some programs, and soon the screen starts to fill with green text lines. It gradually
    becomes clear that Wouter’s device is connecting to the laptops, smartphones,
    and tablets of cafe visitors.</p><p>On his screen, phrases like “iPhone Joris”
    and “Simone’s MacBook” start to appear. The device’s antenna is intercepting the
    signals that are being sent from the laptops, smartphones, and tablets around
    us.</p><p>More text starts to appear on the screen. We are able to see which WiFi
    networks the devices were previously connected to. Sometimes the names of the
    networks are composed of mostly numbers and random letters, making it hard to
    trace them to a definite location, but more often than not, these WiFi networks
    give away the place they belong to.</p><p>We learn that Joris had previously visited
    McDonald’s, probably spent his vacation in Spain (lots of Spanish-language network
    names), and had been kart-racing (he had connected to a network belonging to a
    well-known local kart-racing center). Martin, another café visitor, had been logged
    on to the network of Heathrow airport and the American airline Southwest. In Amsterdam,
    he’s probably staying at the White Tulip Hostel. He had also paid a visit to a
    coffee shop called The Bulldog.<center></p><h3>Session 1:</center></h3><p><center></p><h2>Let
    everyone connect to our fake network</center></h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*AjZJmRgU8tCzcH29Wk6YXg.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p><strong>The waitress serves</strong> us our coffee and hands us
    the WiFi password. After Slotboom is connected, he is able to provide all the
    visitors with an internet connection and to redirect all internet traffic through
    his little device.</p><p>Most smartphones, laptops, and tablets automatically
    search and connect to WiFi networks. They usually prefer a network with a previously
    established connection. If you have ever logged on to the T-Mobile network on
    the train, for example, your device will search for a T-Mobile network in the
    area.</p><p>Slotboom’s device is capable of registering these searches and appearing
    as that trusted WiFi network. I suddenly see the name of my home network appear
    on my iPhone’s list of available networks, as well as my workplace, and a list
    of cafes, hotel lobbies, trains, and other public places I’ve visited. My phone
    automatically connects itself to one of these networks, which all belong to the
    black device.</p><p>Slotboom can also broadcast a fictitious network name, making
    users believe they are actually connecting to the network of the place they’re
    visiting. For example, if a place has a WiFi network consisting of random letters
    and numbers (Fritzbox xyz123), Slotboom is able to provide the network name (Starbucks).
    People, he says, are much more willing to connect to these.</p><p>We see more
    and more visitors log on to our* <em>fictitious</em> *network. The siren song
    of the little black device appears to be irresistible. Already 20 smartphones
    and laptops are ours. If he wanted to, Slotboom could now completely ruin the
    lives of the people connected: He can retrieve their passwords, steal their identity,
    and plunder their bank accounts. Later today, he will show me how. I have given
    him permission to hack me in order to demonstrate what he is capable of, though
    it could be done to anyone with a smartphone in search of a network, or a laptop
    connecting to a WiFi network.</p><p>Everything, with very few exceptions, can
    be cracked.</p><p>The idea that public WiFi networks are not secure is not exactly
    news. It is, however, news that can’t be repeated often enough. There are currently
    more than <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Smartphone-Users-Worldwide-Will-Total-175-Billion-2014/1010536">1.43
    billion smartphone users worldwide</a> and more than 150 million smartphone owners
    in the U.S. More than <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/166745/americans-tech-tastes-change-times.aspx">92
    million</a> American adults own a tablet and more than <a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html">155
    million</a> own a laptop. Each year the worldwide demand for more laptops and
    tablets increases. In 2013, an estimated 206 million tablets and 180 million laptops
    were sold worldwide. Probably everyone with a portable device has once been connected
    to a public WiFi network: while having a coffee, on the train, or at a hotel.</p><p>The
    good news is that some networks are better protected than others; some email and
    social media services use encryption methods that are more secure than their competitors.
    But spend a day walking in the city with Wouter Slotboom, and you’ll find that
    almost everything and everyone connected to a WiFi network can be hacked. A <a
    href="https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/reports/2013-DataBreachQuickView.pdf">study</a>
    from threat intelligence consultancy Risk Based Security estimates that more than
    822 million <a href="https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2014/02/2013-data-breach-quickview/">records</a>
    <a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/02/19/2013-an-epic-year-for-data-breaches-with-over-800-million-records-lost/">were
    exposed</a> worldwide in 2013, including credit card numbers, birth dates, medical
    information, phone numbers, social security numbers, addresses, user names, emails,
    names, and passwords. Sixty-five percent of those records came from the U.S. According
    to IT security firm Kaspersky Lab, in 2013 an estimated 37.3 million users worldwide
    and 4.5 million Americans were the victim of phishing—or pharming—attempts, meaning
    payment details were stolen from hacked computers, smartphones, or website users.</p><p>Report
    after report shows that digital identity fraud is an increasingly common problem.
    Hackers and cybercriminals currently have many different tricks at their disposal.
    But the prevalence of open, unprotected WiFi networks does make it extremely easy
    for them. The Netherlands National Cyber ​​Security Center, a division of the
    Ministry of Security and Justice, did not issue the following advice in vain:
    “It is not advisable to use open WiFi networks in public places. If these networks
    are used, work or financial related activities should better be avoided.”</p><p>Slotboom
    calls himself an “ethical hacker,” or one of the good guys; a technology buff
    who wants to reveal the potential dangers of the internet and technology. He advises
    individuals and companies on how to better protect themselves and their information.
    He does this, as he did today, usually by demonstrating how easy it is to inflict
    damage. Because really, it’s child’s play: The device is cheap, and the software
    for intercepting traffic is very easy to use and is readily available for download.
    “All you need is 70 Euros, an average IQ, and a little patience,” he says. I will
    refrain from elaborating on some of the more technical aspects, such as equipment,
    software, and apps needed to go about hacking people.<center></p><h3>Session 2:</center></h3><p><center></p><h2>Scanning
    for name, passwords, and sexual orientation</center></h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*3xtOEHNi9oXoT5iAV5jBMw.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p><strong>Armed with Slotboom’s</strong> backpack, we move to a coffeehouse
    that is known for the beautiful flowers drawn in the foam of the lattes, and as
    a popular spot for freelancers working on laptops. This place is now packed with
    people concentrating on their screens.</p><p>Slotboom switches on his equipment.
    He takes us through the same steps, and within a couple of minutes, 20 or so devices
    are connected to ours. Again we see their Mac-addresses and login history, and
    in some cases their owners’ names. At my request, we now go a step further.</p><p>Slotboom
    launches another program (also readily available for download), which allows him
    to extract even more information from the connected smartphones and laptops. We
    are able to see the specifications of the mobile phone models (Samsung Galaxy
    S4), the language settings for the different devices, and the version of the operating
    system used (iOS 7.0.5). If a device has an outdated operating system, for example,
    there are always known “bugs,” or holes in the security system that can be easily
    exploited. With this kind of information, you have what you need to break into
    the operating system and take over the device. A sampling of the coffeehouse customers
    reveals that none of the connected devices have the latest version of the operating
    system installed. For all these legacy systems, a known bug is listed online.</p><p>We
    can now see some of the actual internet traffic of those around us. We see that
    someone with a MacBook is browsing the site <a href="http://www.nu.nl/">Nu.nl</a>.
    We can see that many devices are sending documents using WeTransfer, some are
    connecting to Dropbox, and some show activity on Tumblr. We see that someone has
    just logged on to FourSquare. The name of this person is also shown, and, after
    googling his name, we recognize him as the person sitting just a few feet away
    from us.</p><p>Information comes flooding in, even from visitors who are not*
    *actively working or surfing. Many email programs and apps constantly make contact
    with their servers—a necessary step for a device to retrieve new emails. For some
    devices and programs, we are able to see what information is being sent, and to
    which server.</p><p>And now it’s getting really personal. We see that one visitor
    has the gay dating app Grindr installed on his smartphone. We also see the name
    and type of the smartphone he’s using (iPhone 5s). We stop here, but it would
    be a breeze to find out to who the phone belongs to. We also see that someone’s
    phone is attempting to connect to a server in Russia, sending the password along
    with it, which we are able to intercept.<center></p><h3>Session 3:</center></h3><p><center></p><h2>Obtaining
    information on occupation, hobbies, and relational problems</center></h2><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*LWZjOpC98xJT1WX9CpBZBg.jpeg" alt=""></p><p><strong>Many
    apps, programs,</strong> websites, and types of software make use of encryption
    technologies. These are there to ensure that the information sent and received
    from a device is not accessible to unauthorized eyes. But once the user is connected
    to Slotboom’s WiFi network, these security measures can be circumvented relatively
    easily, with the help of decryption software.</p><p>To our shared surprise, we
    see an app sending personal information to a company that sells online advertising.
    Among other things, we see the location data, technical information of the phone,
    and information of the WiFi network. We can also see the name (first and last)
    of a woman using the social bookmarking* *website Delicious. Delicious allows
    users to share websites—bookmarks—they are interested in. In principle, the pages
    that users of Delicious share are available publicly, yet we can’t help feeling
    like voyeurs when we realize just how much we are able to learn about this woman
    on the basis of this information.</p><p>First we google her name, which immediately
    allows us to determine what she looks like and where in the coffeehouse she is
    sitting. We learn that she was born in a different European country and only recently
    moved to the Netherlands. Through Delicious we discover that she’s been visiting
    the website of a Dutch language course and she has bookmarked a website with information
    on the Dutch integration course.</p><p>In less than 20 minutes, here’s what we’ve
    learned about the woman sitting 10 feet from us: where she was born, where she
    studied, that she has an interest in yoga, that she’s bookmarked an online offer
    for a anti-snore mantras, recently visited Thailand and Laos, and shows a remarkable
    interest in sites that offer tips on how to save a relationship.</p><p>Slotboom
    shows me some more hacker tricks. Using an app on his phone, he is able to change
    specific words on any website. For example, whenever the word “Opstelten” (the
    name of a Dutch politician) is mentioned, people see the word “Dutroux” (the name
    of a convicted serial killer) rendered on the page instead. We tested it and it
    works. We try another trick: Anyone loading a website that includes pictures gets
    to see a picture selected by Slotboom. This all sounds funny if you’re looking
    for some mischief, but it also makes it possible to load images of child pornography
    on someone’s smartphone, the possession of which is a criminal offense.<center></p><h2>Password
    intercepted</center></h2><p><strong>We visit yet</strong> another cafe. My last
    request to Slotboom is to show me what he would do if he wanted to really harm
    me. He asks me to go to Live.com (the Microsoft email site) and enter a random
    username and password. A few seconds later, the information I just typed appears
    on his screen. “Now I have the login details of your email account,” Slotboom
    says. “The first thing I would do is change the password of your account and indicate
    to other services you use that I have forgotten my password. Most people use the
    same email account for all services. And those new passwords will then be sent
    to your mailbox, which means I will have them at my disposal as well.” We do the
    same for Facebook: Slotboom is able to intercept the login name and password I
    entered with relative ease.</p><p>Another trick that Slotboom uses is to divert
    my internet traffic. For example, whenever I try to access the webpage of my bank,
    he has instructed his program to re-direct me to a page he owns: a cloned site
    that appears to be identical to the trusted site, but is in fact completely controlled
    by Slotboom. Hackers call this DNS* *spoofing. The information I entered on the
    site is stored on the server owned by Slotboom. Within 20 minutes he’s obtained
    the login details, including passwords for my Live.com, SNS Bank, Facebook, and
    DigiD accounts.</p><p>I will never again be connecting to an insecure public WiFi
    network without taking security measures.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*2UTDNFJKz2Jtp8ZcZiVILA.jpeg"

    Grubnyak</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/brain?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>The
    relationships between our brain and body and the world around us is complex. What
    you do or don’t do can significantly change your health and wellbeing.</p><p>A
    healthy brain is determined by biological and physiological factors — genes, hormones,
    the immune system, nutrition, exercise, and other lifestyle choices.</p><p>Social,
    psychological and environmental factors including relationships, stress, emotions,
    mindset, life events, and current circumstances also contribute to your brain
    health.</p><p>Each element can impact others in a multi-directional and dynamic
    way. For example, your thoughts can influence your physical health (which is why
    chronic stress can lead to abnormal heart rhythms or heart attacks).</p><p>Everyone
    wants to live an active, vibrant life for as long as possible. And that goal depends
    on robust brain health. You can’t do much about your genes, but other physiological,
    social and environmental factors can be modified to improve your brain.</p><p>Our
    brains naturally decline if we do nothing to protect them. However, if we intervene
    early, we can slow the decline process — it’s easier to protect a healthy brain
    than to try to repair damage once it’s done.</p><p>You can improve your lifestyle
    habits to promote a highly healthy brain — one free of physical or mental illness,
    disease, and pain. We have more control over our aging brains than we realize.</p><p>These
    habits are just a reminder — you already know the importance of these lifestyle
    choices. It pays to make a conscious effort to help yourself — your brain will
    thank you.</p><h3>1. Healthy brains know the long-term value of brain food</h3><p>That
    means eating lots of foods associated with slowing cognitive decline — blueberries,
    vegetables (leafy greens — kale, spinach, broccoli), whole grains, getting protein
    from fish and legumes and choosing healthy unsaturated fats (olive oil) over saturated
    fats (butter).</p><p>The connection between what goes into your body and how your
    brain performs is strong. This diet is also good for your brain, heart, and blood
    vessels.</p><p>“Omega-3 fats from fish or nuts fight inflammation associated with
    neurodegeneration. Fruit and vegetables combat age-related oxidative stress that
    causes wear and tear on brain cells,” says Dr. Gary Small, a professor of psychiatry
    and aging, and director of the Longevity Center at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience
    &amp; Human Behavior, University of California, Los Angeles.</p><h3>2. A healthy
    brain creates calm: It really matters!</h3><p>Find your moment or place of calm
    and separate yourself from chronic stress.</p><p>Chronic stress can change the
    wiring of our brains.“Stress shrinks the brain’s memory centres, and the stress
    hormone cortisol temporarily impairs memory,” says Dr Small.</p><p>To reverse
    stress and improve your mood and memory, adopt relaxation methods like meditation.
    “Meditation even rewires the brain and improves measures of chromosomes’ telomere
    (protective cap) length, which predicts longer life expectancy” argues Dr Small.</p><p>Find
    your place or moment of calm, and do something pleasurable that makes you come
    alive — a personal passion project can help you destress.</p><h3>3. Even 20 minutes
    of daily brisk walking is beneficial to maintain a healthy brain</h3><p>Physical
    activity is one of the best things you can do for your brain and body. You already
    know the countless benefits of exercising.</p><p>There is a lot of <a href="https://cp.neurology.org/content/8/3/257">research</a>
    that has found that nearly any type of physical activity — walking, running, cycling,
    minimal weight-lifting and even mindful exercise such as yoga contributes to improved
    cognitive performance.</p><p>Exercise stimulates the brain to release brain-derived
    neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a molecule essential for repairing brain cells and
    creating connections between them.</p><p>Physical activity also boosts endorphins,
    which can lift your mood. “Aerobic exercise helps improve the health of brain
    tissue by increasing blood flow to the brain and reducing the chances of injury
    to the brain from cholesterol buildup in blood vessels and from high blood pressure,”
    says Dr Joel Salinas, a neurologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General
    Hospital.</p><p>A simple walk outdoors gets you away from digital devices and
    into nature. You’ll do your best thinking when walking.</p><h3>4. Engaging in
    mentally stimulating activities creates new brain connections and more cognitive
    reserve</h3><p>Stimulating and challenging the brain helps it stay fit and firing.
    Spend some time in new thoughts.</p><p>To improve your brain health, try to do
    one activity that challenges the mind every day — spend some time in new thoughts.
    The desire to learn and understand other people, ideas, cultures and concepts
    can boost your brain.</p><p>“…higher cognitive activity endows the brain with
    a greater ability to endure the effects of brain pathologies compared to a person
    with lower cognitive engagement throughout life,” says David S. Knopman, M.D.,
    a clinical neurologist involved in research in late-life cognitive disorders.</p><p>Lifelong
    learning and mentally challenging work build cognitive reserve. Find reasonably
    challenging activities you can practice regularly — try activities that combine
    mental, social and physical challenges.</p><h3>5. Make meaningful connections
    to stay sharp</h3><p>We’re social creatures — meaningful social connections make
    us happier. Happiness makes your brain work better.</p><p>Psychological studies
    show that conversation stimulates the brain. It may seem effortless to many, but
    it requires a complex combination of skills including attention, memory, thinking,
    speech and social awareness.</p><p>A <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2007.115923">study</a>
    published in the *American Journal of Public Health *found that better social
    interaction can help protect the brain against dementia and Alzheimer’s.</p><p>Social
    connections are as important to our flourishing as the need for food, safety,
    and shelter. The urge to connect is a life-long human need.</p><p>Matthew Lieberman,
    a social psychologist, neuroscientist, and author of *Social: Why Our Brains Are
    Wired to Connect, *sees the brain as the center of the social self. He writes
    in his book, “It’s hard to find meaning in what we do if at some level it doesn’t
    help someone else or make someone happier.”</p><p>Researchers at the Oregon Health
    &amp; Science University and the University of Michigan have <a href="https://myhometouch.com/articles/social-interaction-and-brain-health">suggested</a>
    that human interaction and conversation could be the keys to maintaining brain
    function as we grow older.</p><p>Supportive friends, family and social connections
    helps you live longer, happier and healthier. Socialising reduces the harmful
    effects of stress</p><h3>6. A healthy brain doesn’t overlook or underappreciate
    quality sleep and “wakeful rest”</h3><p>Sleep is the number one, fundamental bedrock
    of good health. A good night sleep every night should be a priority, not a luxury.</p><p>“Without
    good sleep, we see increased anxiety and stress. Sleep is restorative, helping
    you be more mentally energetic and productive,” advises Sandra Bond Chapman, Ph.D.,
    founder and chief director of the Center for BrainHealth at the University of
    Texas at Dallas and author of <em>Make Your Brain Smarter.</em></p><p>Apart from
    getting a good and quality night sleep, make time for “wakeful rest” — it pays
    to plan breaks in between your busy schedule. Plan downtime on your calendar.</p><p>After
    a busy day, give your brain time to recover — sit back, close your eyes and let
    your mind wander (spontaneous thought in our wakeful life)— in the knowledge that
    your brain is busy consolidating information.</p><p>In a study on <em>Boosting
    Long-Term Memory via Wakeful Rest, *the authors found that “</em>wakeful rest*”
    — without any external stimulation — allows the brain to consolidate the memories
    of what it has learned.</p><p>It is never too early or too late to start living
    more healthily. Your daily habits have more impact on how long and how well you
    live — plan to eat well, take short walks, engage in mental stimulation, and manage
    your social connections for better brain health.</p>'

  :title: Facebook’s Mental Health Problem
  :content: '<p>The most important thing I learned in 2015? That depression and social
    media do not go well together at all.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2880/1*A-eekcg_7mCIdPr6oVjvjQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The first time I deleted the Facebook app from my phone was in October
    2014. It wasn’t a considered decision. Rather, it felt like dumping a half-eaten
    tub of ice cream before I could gobble down the whole thing and feel sick, or
    deleting the number of a man who clearly doesn’t have my best interests at heart:
    a panicked intervention by reason to prevent my out-of-control animal instinct
    from doing further harm to myself.</p><p>That October I suffered my first bout
    of depression in over 10 years. Once I realised what was going (it took me a while),
    I swiftly pulled out of all work projects and withdrew to the care of very close
    friends and the quiet safety of my home. I tried to read books and failed; I tried
    to watch films and couldn’t focus for more than a few minutes at a time. My attention
    span, never a soldier, had shrivelled up. So I found myself clutching my phone
    and switching between the Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter apps for hours at a
    time. Not to post — I couldn’t think of anything — but to consume. Yet with every
    double-tap on the home button, with every pull-to-refresh motion, things got worse.</p><blockquote><h1>Every
    receding wave left a despair more profound than the one before — yet every time
    I wanted nothing more than the comforting waters to return. Pull to refresh.</h1></blockquote><p>It
    was a sensation like nothing I’d known before, like consuming a particularly vile
    drug: A quickening of the heartbeat, a wave of warmth and comfort, then a bleak,
    sickly, and tense emptiness, like the tide withdrawing from the shore and leaving
    nothing but loneliness in its damp wake. No matter how desperately I clutched
    at it, the water ran through my fingers, and every receding wave left a despair
    more profound than the one before— yet every time I wanted nothing more than the
    comforting waters to return. Pull to refresh.</p><p>It was a nauseating vicious
    cycle, and I had to get out. There was no one there to help me because I wouldn’t
    have known how to explain it. All I had were brief instances when the fog lifted
    a little and I was able to see that something bad was going on. I waited for one
    of those instances, then mustered all available energy and made what seemed, at
    the time, one of the most important decisions of my life: I deleted the Facebook
    app. Then Instagram. Then Twitter. I turned off all notifications, of which there’d
    been many. Except for text messages and calls from close friends and family, my
    phone was now silent. The world was suddenly much smaller, much more manageable,
    much more intimate. It allowed me to get better. And a few weeks later, without
    much thinking about it, I was back on social media.</p><p>The story might have
    ended there—had my depression not returned with a vengeance in the spring, plunging
    me right back into that horrible, horrible vicious cycle. Off the social apps
    went. But this time, maybe because I needed something to hold on to and pseudo-scientific
    inquiry felt like a good enough straw, I set out to understand what exactly was
    going on here.</p><p>It quickly turned out that it wasn’t just me. The friends
    and acquaintances I spoke to who had been through episodes of depression all told
    similar stories: during depression, social media was off limits. Some had taken
    breaks. Others had deleted their accounts. One had been ordered by his therapist
    to get off Facebook. Nobody had given it much thought. Most considered it simply
    another of the many mysteries surrounding depression, this weird disease of which
    not very much is known except common symptoms and general statistics.</p><p><strong>Common
    symptoms</strong>: You’re <em>very</em> low on energy. You can’t concentrate.
    You can’t deal with people. You can’t deal with stress. You may suffer headaches,
    back pain, sleeping disorders, and wildly varying appetite. Most of the time,
    you are not so much sad but catatonic. You just don’t feel anything. Except like
    a loser. And you can’t escape it. As Sylvia Plath wrote: “[W]herever I sat — on
    the deck of a ship or at a street café in Paris or Bangkok — I would be sitting
    under the same glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air.”</p><p><strong>General
    statistics</strong>: The German Ministry for Education and Research states that
    the probability of experiencing major depression once in your life lies between
    16 and 20 percent in Germany, where I live. The U.S. National Institute of Mental
    Health says that in 2012, an estimated 16 million adults in the US, or 6.9 percent
    of the adult population, had suffered at least one major depressive episode in
    the past year. The World Health Organisation estimates there are 350 million people
    suffering from depression globally, and that by 2020 it will be the second most
    widespread disease in the world.</p><p>This is shoddy statistics, but: 350 million
    people is one quarter of Facebook’s global user base.</p><p>There is no scientific
    research to back up my claim or explain this link between depression and social
    media use — or at least I haven’t been able to find any. There are plenty of studies
    into how social media may <em>cause</em> depression, but the evidence is thin:
    For every study <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0069841">claiming
    proof</a> that social media is harmful, <a href="http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X%2812%2900209-1/abstract?cc=y=">there’s
    another</a> saying it isn’t. (<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-02/uom-ifu020315.php">One
    study from the University of Missouri from February 2015</a> basically tried to
    settle the debate by saying it all depends on how you use it. Stalk acquaintances
    and compare your life to theirs, and bang, here comes depression. Dotingly check
    on your friends and family, and you’ll be happy. Which begs the question: Have
    the researchers ever actually used Facebook?)</p><blockquote><h1>“Oh yes, I see
    that a lot,” my psychiatrist said matter-of-factly when I asked her whether her
    other depressive patients were also unable to use social media. “One even dumped
    her phone recently.”</h1></blockquote><p>Yet while there may be no research into
    the effect social media may have on an already existing depression, to specialists
    that effect appears so obvious that it isn’t even particularly noteworthy. “Oh
    yes, I see that a lot,” my psychiatrist at the Psychiatric University Clinic of
    Berlin’s Charité hospital said matter-of-factly when I asked her whether her other
    depressive patients were also unable to use social media. “One even dumped her
    phone recently.” That’s because social media and constant availability cause stress,
    she explained. “Also, when you’re suffering from depression, you don’t usually
    want to see other people’s amazing lives.”</p><p>Seeking more explanations, I
    went all the way up the food chain to Professor Isabella Heuser, director of the
    Charité’s Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, who swiftly confirmed my psychiatrist’s
    assessment of the incompatibility of depression and social media. (While nearly
    all patients she’s seen stay off social media altogether, she did concede that
    some patients go on Facebook when they can’t sleep at night, although she says
    they generally don’t, or can’t, talk about their depression on the platform and
    don’t get anything positive out of the experience).</p><p>I laid out to her what
    I’d found out through self-observation.</p><ol><li><p>That I wasn’t able to perform
    for social media anymore. I used to go through life mentally composing tweets
    and spotting photo opportunities for Instagram. That was unthinkable now. The
    mere thought caused so much anxiety that I could barely unclench my jaws.</p></li><li><p>That
    I now consciously suffered from comparing my life to others’, which was also new.</p></li><li><p>That
    I was experiencing a powerful craving for instant gratification that also felt
    incredibly harmful — remember the receding waters — and that wreaked further havoc
    to my already suffering attention span.</p></li></ol><p>“Well, it’s easy to explain
    <em>that</em> physiologically,” Professor Heuser said when she heard the last
    point. “Through your daily engagement with social media your brain has learned
    that when you log on in the morning, a pleasant feeling will follow. Escapism,
    a positive world. That’s dopamine, anticipation, and you can still experience
    that. However, the positive feeling that usually follows — your organism can’t
    mount that response anymore. That’s a classic symptom of depression. You can’t
    feel joy or connection to others anymore.” And because my brain knows what joy
    used to feel like, she explained, its absence, that emptiness, is experienced
    subconsciously as painful. The fact that I found it so hard to resist the lure
    of said dopamine release was also easy to explain, she said: “Will has to do with
    energy. And depression is characterised precisely by a lack of energy.” And as
    far as my attention span went, well, if it had been low before, depression may
    now simply have pushed it below a threshold that I considered tolerable.</p><blockquote><h1>I
    took to my Facebook feed in search of material and the further I went back, the
    more jealous I felt <em>at my own life</em> as I had portrayed it.</h1></blockquote><p>So
    far, so medically straightforward. But what about the sudden sense of inferiority?
    I told Professor Heuser of one particularly crass example: Shortly before my second
    break-down, an artist friend had asked me to participate in a video examining
    the way we portray ourselves and our accomplishments, both online and off. I was
    to read out a few of my own social media posts. I took to my Facebook feed in
    search of material and the further I went back, the more jealous I felt <em>at
    my own life</em> as I had portrayed it. There they were, my glowing posts from
    Istanbul, Tokyo, and New York City, my tales of adventures in the West Bank and
    the Baltic Sea, the stories I’d written and magazines I’d edited, my clever commentary
    on current affairs, all rounded off by likes and comments from people I’d met
    (or not) at some point in my life — irrevocable proof that I’d once been successful,
    popular, joyful, happy even. At roughly 12 months into the past I was so overcome
    by self-pity that I had to break the whole thing off.</p><p>Professor Heuser thought
    for a moment. “That’s only indirectly related to social media,” she finally said.
    “People suffering from depression are incredibly creative at convincing themselves
    they are losers. But we live in a world that’s hyper-communicative — not really
    communicative, but narcissistic. Everybody is always ‘sharing’ something, only
    that it isn’t really sharing, it’s posting something to a wall in the hope that
    as many people as possible will come past and ‘like’ it. The purpose is to feed
    our narcissism. It is a many-voiced monologue, a cacophony. Everybody is posting
    something, but we aren’t talking to each other.”</p><p>This isn’t novel criticism
    to be levelled at either social media or contemporary culture, and under any other
    circumstance, I would have waved it away as Luddite. However, now for the first
    time in over 10 years of social media use did I actually understand it, feel the
    truth of it in my guts—and I realised to what extent I had happily played along.
    I was reminded of that famous quote by Carl Gustav Jung, the founder of analytical
    psychology: “Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, but from
    being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself.” To a healthy
    person, some phoney dialogue might appear tedious at worst. But to someone suffering
    from depression, the superficiality of social media may just be outrightly harmful.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2880/1*GRbZ6wTCqt5Q0xf9L19Rpg.png" alt=""></p><p>That’s
    an issue the media technologist and writer Deanna Zandt addressed in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYq-1HaIlOg">talk
    she gave at Personal Democracy Forum</a> in June 2015. Zandt presented the audience
    with a sample of photos from her social media feeds. In all of them she was all
    smiles; she was also, she revealed, at the time spiralling into the worst depressive
    period of her life. “The dissonance that was created for me by what was actually
    happening in my life versus what I thought I should be publicly sharing with my
    community made my condition that much worse.”</p><blockquote><h1>“All of this
    is leading us down this dangerous path of alienation. And not just from each other,
    but from our own selves. We’re walking down a technological thrust into collective
    depressive dissonance.”</h1></blockquote><p>Zandt blames digital culture’s focus
    on purity for blowing up the scale at which how we present ourselves in public
    differs from how we actually feel. “All of this is leading us down this dangerous
    path of alienation. And not just from each other, but from our own selves. We’re
    walking down a technological thrust into collective depressive dissonance.” Instead
    of building tools for “silly human mammals” who are “easily trained by positive
    reinforcement,” she argues, technologists should embrace the messiness of human
    life and put it into the core of the products they build. She doesn’t purport
    to know what this would look like, but her demand is clear: Digital culture should
    allow for that space between authenticity, connection, and vulnerability — in
    other words, intimacy.</p><p>Deanna Zandt, I hear you. But I am no media technologist.
    My solution to the problem posed by the incompatibility of depression and social
    media didn’t aim to change anyone’s life but my own. Yet maybe it was no less
    radical: Ruthlessly dispose of all fake intimacy and superficial interactions
    and focus what little energy I had on real connection. Take my feeble attention
    span and put it into the equivalent of an incubator. Learn to consider myself
    a worthy human being without the positive reinforcement of Twitter favs.</p><p>Which
    reminds me: Do people still call them favs?</p><p>I have been mostly off social
    media for seven months now. I have also deleted all non-social apps that trigger
    dopamine release and lure with escapism, like shopping apps and games. When I
    want to escape, I read a novel, and when I can’t concentrate, I go for a walk.
    I often leave the house without my phone. I have sworn off multitasking to the
    extent that for a while, I’ve even stopped listening to music while I work. And
    it made me feel *a lot *better. Sometimes I wish I were strong enough to delete
    my account on Facebook, which I now regard as the most dangerous of all social
    networks. As it is, I’ll keep my URL blocker on, limiting my daily dispense of
    methadone to 10 minutes and appreciating that they’ve made a separate Messenger
    app.</p><p>This wasn’t an easy article for me to write, and an even harder one
    to publish. I have become a much more private person in recent months and anyway,
    writing about depression does not fit with the professional version of myself
    I used to present online.</p><p>But while I’m worried about exposure, I also believe
    depression should be something we talk about more openly—everything else just
    feels ridiculous at this point. Ultimately I, like many other people, will have
    to find a way to cope with social media, just like I’ve had to learn to cope with
    the ready availability of sugary foods: through awareness and self-control. I
    don’t expect Twitter or Facebook to help me, just like I don’t expect Kraft Foods
    to do so. But I’d like to at least be aware of the risk factors — be they a propensity
    for diabetes, or depression.</p>'

    folks). Photos courtesy of the author."><em>Ramadi, Iraq (Finger ALWAYS off trigger…
    proper training goes a long way, folks). Photos courtesy of the author.</em></p><p>“What
    the hell do you need that weapon for?”</p><p>I whistled low through my teeth,
    feeling the tension mount as the comment lingered in the air. Each of us were
    desperate for someone to point out the obvious, yet when it happened I wanted
    to crawl under a table, eat popcorn, and watch from afar. I thought my fellow
    soldier’s comment would provoke a war of words but he doubled down and used a
    scorched-earth tactic.</p><p>“Is it so you can look cool in your office while
    jerking it to PowerPoint slides while we’re the ones left to catch bullets?”</p><p>The
    staff officer was visibly shocked and then turned a fury red.</p><p>“Get ahold
    of your soldier, first sergeant!” He roared.</p><p>While the rest of us tried
    to suppress giggles, our first sergeant clapped the insult-lobbing platoon sergeant
    on the neck and hurried him away.</p><p>The whole incident started when my Army
    unit discovered that the staff officers from our command were trying to commandeer
    our M4 carbine rifles. They planned to leave us with older M16 models that lacked
    optics and night vision capabilities. This became a point of contention, as almost
    all the staff officers had orders to work in a cubicle inside Baghdad’s Green
    Zone, while my team of 30 was being sent to Ramadi, Iraq. At the time, Ramadi
    was the most violent city on Earth, accounting for half of all daily attacks that
    happened in the country of Iraq. That same year, Ramadi <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ramadi_(2006)">would
    also account for half of all deaths</a> that occurred in the United States Marine
    Corps between 2006 and 2007.</p><p>In the end, my team lucked out. The brigade
    commander stepped in and remained adamant that those in combat environments would
    receive the newer weapons.</p><p>Since leaving the military, I’ve been surprised
    by the number of people I’ve encountered who want to show me their AR-15s (the
    civilian version of an M4 or M16). They show them off as if we suddenly have a
    bond because they bought a weapon I went to war with and can strip apart blindfolded.</p><p>I
    always ask the same question: “What made you choose the AR-15?”</p><p>With my
    fellow veterans, it’s an easy answer. The AR-15 is the weapon we’re most familiar
    with. Durable. Lightweight. Personally, it’s what I’m most comfortable hunting
    with (especially boar).</p><blockquote><h1>Some of the responsibilities that come
    with being a soldier include gun control.</h1></blockquote><p>A few of the people
    I’ve asked have responded with legitimate and responsible answers. A few others
    were collectors. But after hearing most people’s reasons, my internal response
    is the same as my fellow sergeant’s outburst. Basically, these people just want
    to look cool.* *They want to play “military” without ever enlisting. Some have
    even shown me that they have the latest tactical gear, leaving me wondering why
    they want all the bells and whistles that come along with being a soldier, yet
    none of the responsibilities. And believe it or not, some of the responsibilities
    that come with being a soldier include gun control.</p><h2>Why the military does
    a better job at gun control than anyone</h2><p>One thing that has baffled me over
    the years is that I can go to the grocery store and buy a pack of Tic Tacs and
    then walk across the street and buy a gun. I’m not baffled that I can buy a gun,
    as I believe it’s an important liberty to have. But what concerns me is the ease
    and utter lack of training required to buy a tool that has no purpose other than
    to kill something.</p><p>A knife can be used for cooking and a bat for baseball.
    But a gun? Unless you’re collecting them for a museum, the point of a gun is to
    kill something.</p><p><strong>Let me give you a breakdown of how the military
    gets gun control right, and society has the process backwards:</strong></p><p>When
    you enlist in the military, you spend several weeks learning weapons safety and
    training. Before you are ever allowed to fire a weapon, you must be able to disassemble
    the rifle, clean it, and then reassemble it. You take tests and quizzes asking
    you questions pertaining to the distance and speed a bullet can travel. Once you
    pass your exams, you will then be allowed to fire the weapon under the supervision
    and training of drill sergeants and weapons experts. Finally, you must qualify
    with your weapon on targets. If you’re unable to do that, they will not allow
    you to graduate from basic training.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*sTCDldYMP1j_kpT7XexbfA.jpeg"
    alt="Even overseas, training and practice is vital towards safety."><em>Even overseas,
    training and practice is vital towards safety.</em></p><p>In the military, every
    weapon has a serial number. If that weapon gets lost or misplaced, they know “who
    done it” and there are serious repercussions. If you own a personal weapon, you
    must register it with the base you’re stationed at.</p><p>In combat or on duty,
    if it’s determined you’re mentally unfit to carry out your duties, your weapon
    is confiscated. You’ll then go through counseling until you’re deemed fit to once
    more carry out your duties. I’ve seen it happen on more than one occasion.</p><p>Now
    compare that to the process of any random person buying a gun in the United States,
    where there’s no required training and no one who determines whether you’re mentally
    sound.</p><h2><strong>“See! This is why we need common sense gun laws,” you say</strong></h2><p>We’re
    all tired of mass shootings and know something needs to change. Like you, I fear
    for my child’s safety at school, and I believe there are reforms that need to
    take place. The current battle cry is “common sense gun laws” but when pressed,
    most people can’t articulate what the hell that means aside from emotionally vague
    sentiments.</p><p>The most common argument for gun control is to ban certain styles
    of weapons from the populace or ensure greater safety measures — but you’re more
    likely to hear polarizing extremes when this is discussed, as opposed to a thoughtful
    and well-informed debate. Let me show you an example of how most people don’t
    know what they’re talking about.</p><h3><strong>Pop quiz, HotShot! (Bonus points
    if you get the reference.)</strong></h3><p>Below is a photo of your standard AR-15
    with collapsible buttstock, rail sights for optics, and a 30-round magazine. Below
    that is a Ruger Mini 14.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*FJKWjKnzJ0C-wknYEDTuQg.png"

    alt="A Ruger Mini 14 | [Ruger](https://ruger.com/products/mini14RanchRifle/models.html)"><em>A
    Ruger Mini 14 | <a href="https://ruger.com/products/mini14RanchRifle/models.html">Ruger</a></em></p><ol><li><p>Can
    you tell me the difference between the two?</p></li><li><p>Which one of these
    should be banned (and why) under “common sense” gun laws?</p></li></ol><p>Most
    people will point to the AR-15 as the weapon that needs a ban because they associate
    the AR-15 with mass shootings. Aside from that, they know little to nothing about
    guns. When I ask about the Ruger Mini 14, however, people assume it’s just your
    standard hunting rifle. But nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>Both
    weapons are semi-automatic rifles that fire .223 caliber bullets. Both have the
    option of collapsible buttstocks, advanced optics, and customization. In fact,
    here’s a Ruger Mini 14 with custom, tactical options:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*EtBKgQc1tbaSbNnvuvLEQA.png"
    alt="A Ruger Mini 14 Model 5846 | [Ruger](https://ruger.com/products/mini14TacticalRifle/specSheets/5846.html)"><em>A
    Ruger Mini 14 Model 5846 | <a href="https://ruger.com/products/mini14TacticalRifle/specSheets/5846.html">Ruger</a></em></p><p>Yet,
    there is no difference in the lethality between the Ruger mini 14 with tactical
    options and the version without. It just looks different because one has wood
    paneling. Thus, when most people say “common sense gun laws” they’re really saying
    “ban weapons that look scary.”</p><p>Another argument is to ban semi-automatic
    weapons. The only problem with that is that you’d need to ban pistols, most rifles,
    and some shotguns if you want to go with that category. A semi-automatic weapon
    is nothing more than a weapon whose firing mechanism you don’t have to re-cock.
    When the bullet shell ejects, it loads the next bullet into the chamber. The speed
    at which you can fire the weapon depends solely on how fast you can pull the trigger.</p><h2>Potential
    solutions</h2><p>If we want to impart common sense gun laws and not let our emotions
    or misinformation dictate the outcome, perhaps we should follow the same lead
    as the military:</p><ol><li>*<em>You’re required to go through training and orientation
    first. *</em>You must be able to disassemble the weapon and clean it, plus know
    the difference between bullet calibers and rate of fire. Afterwards, you’ll be
    supervised by a weapons instructor and pass target practice. Then, and only then,
    will you be allowed to take the weapon home. (Veterans and law enforcement are
    exempt.)</li></ol><p><strong>2. Your weapon will be registered with the local
    police and you’re responsible for its whereabouts.</strong> <em>(</em>This needs
    to be true to a greater degree than what we have in place now.<em>)</em> Parents,
    if your kids get hold of your weapons and do something dumb, you’re responsible
    in the same way that you would be if they were driving your car and hit someone.
    There are repercussions on your end too.</p><p>*<em>3. Required mental health
    and criminal background checks. *</em>(It’s embarrassing that I even have to state
    this.) This is perhaps the largest part of the issue that doesn’t have any proper
    solutions.</p><h2>If we don’t address mental health, we miss a huge part of the
    problem</h2><p>In October 2016, one of my good friends killed herself. I was the
    last person to speak with her before she put a gun to her head and ended her life.</p><p>When
    I found out that she’d committed suicide with a firearm, I was angry. She should
    have never been allowed to buy a weapon in the first place. I knew firsthand of
    her long history with mental illness, and her issues were well documented with
    psychiatrists. She even informed her clinician that due to a recent divorce, she
    was struggling with suicidal ideation. A few days prior to ending her life, she
    bought a handgun. That weapon would be how she exited this world.</p><p><a href="http://heartsupport.com/">As
    someone who works inside the mental health industry</a>, I’ll be the first to
    tell you that this is a major issue left unaddressed. I’ve been working on a new
    program (with a mental health expert) to help men and women combat depression.
    Often when I speak with men and women about their depression, anxiety, or other
    mental health issues and I ask what they think the reason behind their issues
    is, they say, “I don’t know.”</p><p>However, I have a hunch that the men and women
    responding** <strong>do know; they’re</strong> **just avoiding a deeper or more
    intimate conversation. So we surveyed over 500 men and women and the results were
    staggering. In the survey, our respondents could choose as many answers as they
    wanted that felt relevant to their situation. We asked things like “Does past
    pain or trauma play a part in your depression?” and “Are emotional or relational
    issues part of your depression?”</p><p>75% of respondents said stress and difficult
    life situations were the number one reason behind their depression. Relational
    issues with others and not knowing how to handle their emotions also affected
    60% of those who responded. Unresolved past pain and lacking purpose or direction
    in life accounted for more than half of all respondents. Less than 5% said they
    “didn’t know” the reason behind their depression, and that number is misleading
    because almost every person chose another reason in addition to “I don’t know.”</p><p>What
    we’re seeing is an entire generation of people who no longer have the skills necessary
    to face adversity or learn how to become resilient men and women. Bullying in
    schools is endemic, and it’s no longer just the kid from the traumatic home who’s
    lashing out. It’s the “mean girls” and the cool kids asserting dominance and slighting
    even their closest friends because that’s what they see on social media and from
    celebrities. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/many-americans-are-lonely-survey-finds/">More
    people are more lonely and isolated than ever before</a> and they’re lashing out,
    too. Men, in particular, have toxic views of masculinity, like: “<a href="https://byrslf.co/thoughts-on-the-vegas-shooting-14af397cee2c">Real
    men do everything on their own. Real men don’t cry. Real men express anger through
    violence.</a>”</p><p>I’ve heard people tell me “I got bullied and didn’t shoot
    anyone.” Yeah, me neither. I even got stitches from a school bully. But there’s
    a saying in the military’s SERE school (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape),
    which is where you learn to experience torture as a prisoner of war: “Everyone
    breaks.”</p><p>You’ve probably heard that phrase in the movies or from political
    hearings on torture, too. Once you’ve experienced bullying, isolation, or trauma
    long enough, you too will snap.</p><p>As we’re seeing, because of the increase
    in mental health issues and people not knowing how to develop healthy coping mechanisms,
    is that people are snapping. Some people are already there, and others are on
    their way. And if we allow people with these issues access to firearms? It’s the
    perfect storm.</p><p>I have friends who struggle with rampant feelings of worthlessness
    or are cutting themselves. I know people who deal with suicide ideation. They
    should not have access to a firearm until they’re healed.</p><p>The argument will
    then become: “That heaps more shame on me for having mental health issues, and
    I should have the same freedom as others.” But I don’t let my daughter play underneath
    the kitchen sink where the Drano is and say, “I hope this works out. I want you
    to have the freedoms I do.” That’s irresponsible. What’s responsible is restricting
    her freedoms.</p><p>So what should we do? One solution (which won’t fix everything
    but is a start) is to require counselors, social workers, and psychiatrists to
    report men and women to a database where they’ll be restricted from owning a firearm
    until they are deemed emotionally healthy once more. We already do this with convicted
    felons, so it’s not a stretch.</p><h2>You might say: I still think “assault rifles”
    should be banned</h2><p>I’ll make a compromise with you but first, a clarification:</p><p>There
    is no such thing as an “assault rifle.” I’m assuming you think AR stands for “Assault
    Rifle” but it’s only a branding for “Armalite Rifle.” Instead, you would have
    to determine what qualifies as an assault rifle based on caliber size and capabilities.
    If you instead banned every gun that has the qualities of an AR-15, you can end
    up banning standard hunting rifles, too. Thus, the whole situation is fickle and
    volatile because everyone’s emotions are involved on both sides of the aisle.
    Just like you, I’m sick of seeing death at every corner and I fear for my child’s
    safety. Something has to be done.</p><p>To compromise, I’d even be okay with the
    following: Let law enforcement and veterans be the only ones eligible to own the
    “scary weapons.”** **(But first, the populace would have to define which weapons
    are okay based on caliber and capability; as stated, that’s more nuanced than
    most people care to explain. It’s easier to say “ban this particular gun” as opposed
    to doing research and becoming knowledgeable on the subject).</p><p>The reason
    I suggest this is because in this case, less than 1% of the population would own
    a particular brand of firearm. Maybe then veterans will finally get the care and
    access to mental health we’ve been begging for from the VA and our fellow peers
    (as well as you, dear reader). It also provides a valuable service as far as checks
    and balances for the government and 2nd Amendment enthusiasts which ties into
    the next objection.</p><h2>You might say: Why did you suggest only veterans and
    law enforcement get to have AR-15s?</h2><p>Let me shoot you straight: The reason
    I suggested it is because if there was ever a revolution to overthrow a tyrannical
    government, you know who’d be leading it? Veterans and law enforcement. Not you
    and your hunting buddies. You literally hunt a dumb animal. Deers, ducks, and
    boar are dumb. You think you and your friends are gonna go all <em>Walking Dead</em>
    and suddenly know military tactics, flanking techniques, and urban warfare? Please.</p><blockquote><h1>Human
    beings were not meant to kill each other. There’s something deep inside of us
    that knows it’s wrong.</h1></blockquote><p>History will back this up too. Just
    review every major uprising from the American Revolution to the Civil War. Who
    led it? Military veterans ranging from George Washington to Artemas Ward. Veterans
    will be the ones to ensure tyrannical governments are overthrown, not a bunch
    of hunters with AR-15s. Plus, like I stated earlier, I think most people want
    that gun to look cool and fake-play being a soldier. So if you really want it,
    enlist and serve.</p><h2>You might say: Can’t we arm our teachers?</h2><p>Just….
    no. That’s the worst idea ever.</p><p>Human beings were not meant to kill each
    other. There’s something deep inside of us that knows it’s wrong. Even in war,
    it wreaks havoc on those of us who’ve endured watching another man die. No one
    captured this more clearly than David Ayer in the movie <em>Fury</em>. In one
    of the most standout moments of the movie, Shia LeBoeuf’s character meets a recruit
    and tells him:</p><p>“Wait’ll you see it.”</p><p>“See what?”</p><p>“What a man
    can do to another man.”</p><p>I want no part of that responsibility on our educators.
    Leave it to law enforcement.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2250/1*_sNJmROMcO9WUcT_CRh-SQ.jpeg"
    alt="Seriously people?"><em>Seriously people?</em></p><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>I
    realize this is an emotionally charged topic, with men and women on opposing sides
    of the fence. I have tried to the best of my ability to take a middle road and
    propose realistic solutions. All or nothing arguments get us nowhere and divide
    us further, and then we only surround ourselves in an echo chamber of people who
    believe as we do. We must attempt to reach across the aisle and propose solutions
    based on reality, not pipe dreams.</p><p>To those who feel like guns are the sole
    problem and that by outlawing them all, much of society’s ills would be solved,
    I would remind you that even if we could destroy every gun on this planet, you
    cannot remove a man’s capacity for violence.</p><p>To those who feel guns are
    the solution: The pen has always accomplished more than the sword. The sword is
    a result of the pen when necessary, but we should not long for violence. It should
    be a last resort. From the Federalist papers, to Jesus, to Gandhi, to our own
    government writing laws, words can accomplish great feats. Our children are reaping
    the consequences of our inability to compromise. Please don’t let them be the
    ones to bear our sins.</p><p>There is a middle road available. Now we must come
    together to find it.</p><p><em>For additional reading, I highly recommend Brené

    had some free time over the holidays and wrote this article to showcase, on the
    basis of a personal story, many…</em>hackernoon.com</a></p><h2>Intro</h2><p>This
    post is about how to use modern science and personalized medicine to make yourself
    healthier, more productive and happier. Every day.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*NazrVtwfPp6jnrarZPmKCQ.png"
    alt=""></p><h3><strong>Executive Summary (key points)</strong>:</h3><ul><li><p>I
    am a tech CEO who wanted to have better energy, mood, focus, happiness, confidence,
    willpower, intelligence, health and longevity.</p></li><li><p>Over the last 4–5
    years, my main hobby has been to get that by hacking my body and mind using a
    logical, science-based approach.</p></li><li><p>As part of that I have optimized
    my sleep, nutrition and exercise, done thousands of tests, taken dozens of prescription
    drugs and hundreds of supplements (<strong>part</strong> of the pills I take <strong>every
    day</strong> below), worked with some amazing doctors, meditated &gt;1000 times,
    did psychotherapy, took MDMA, and spent ~$200,000 on all this.</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2844/1*C5SnoUOKVVwmUKE7_5FCdw.png" alt=""></p><ul><li>The
    results have been awesome. Objectively I dropped body fat 26%=&gt;10% (data below),
    got my VO2Max to ~70 (very high), improved lots of biomarkers (some examples also
    below, lots more here: <a href="https://medium.com/@sergefaguet/hundreds-of-biomarkers-i-test-in-pursuit-of-focus-health-energy-confidence-and-happiness-dd01572c518b">https://medium.com/@sergefaguet/hundreds-of-biomarkers-i-test-in-pursuit-of-focus-health-energy-confidence-and-happiness-dd01572c518b</a>).
    And subjectively I feel much happier, calmer, energetic, stable, confident, focused.
    And intelligent, if you think of intelligence as applied ability to solve complex
    problems.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*p0pN2w4a_YVTvNKrpy2Hew.png"

    enhance our performance, increase our wealth, and invest more and more into enhancing
    our performance further).</p></li></ul><p><strong>LEGAL DISCLAIMER: IT IS VERY

    about me</strong>:</h3><p>Serge Faguet, Russian, 32, Cornell undergrad / Stanford
    MBA-dropout, started some tech companies (TokBox — leading B2B video communication
    infrastructure company bought by Telefonica; Ostrovok — largest online travel
    co in Russia, profitable with ~$500m gross turnover in 2017; new stealth-at-this-point
    AI co in Silicon Valley; been through Ycombinator; worked at Google very briefly).</p><p>Before
    all this I had a lot of challenges with anxieties, insecurities, introversion,
    weight, focus, anger management, bad moods, procrastination, and other things
    that many of us struggle with. Now all of them are effectively gone. I mean, I
    wrote these two huge posts in one weekend and didn’t procrastinate for a minute.</p><h3><strong>Why
    I do this stuff</strong>:</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*b6IOHzr6H0PA2Ma95XCEdQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>It seems obvious that whatever our goals are in life, certain things
    can help. I (and many others) want to be more energetic, have better willpower,
    not have bad moods, have the confidence to talk with the cute girl in the line
    at the supermarket.</p><p>All these things depend on transient mental states.
    And they in turn depend on your biochemistry (amongst other things). If you ever
    meditated, took drugs, had a bad night of sleep, or been sick you know this to
    be true: with these biochemical fluctuations your personality changes, and behaviors
    can become much easier or harder.</p><p>My goal is simple: manipulate my biochemistry
    to get more of the things I want, and less of the things I do not want.</p><h3><strong>What
    I want</strong>:</h3><p>Good mood, confidence, focus, energy, willpower, stress
    resilience, brainpower, calm, health, longevity, removal of social anxieties/inhibitions.
    All the time. With minimal investment of time and minimal risk.</p><h3><strong>What
    I do — overview</strong>:</h3><p>I attack 6 major blocks:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*W5yiJKJS61tl4k7Oy2Wqmg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>In this post I will give just an overview of things I feel are most
    important in each area, and then in future posts will dig in at length.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*LpreFCSMTymDKFWmySN6mA.png" alt=""></p><p>Important
    note: all these go together. You cannot sleep well while eating like shit, not
    exercising, and stressing out. And you cannot exercise/eat well/not stress out
    if you sleep badly.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Z2Cs0T6ATUC75wroScOSwg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>In all these areas I use roughly the following framework to decide
    regarding specific tactics:</p><ul><li><p>Is it scientifically sound? (i.e. are
    there studies if such are feasible?)</p></li><li><p>Is it logically sound? (i.e.
    is there a sound explanation behind the tactic?)</p></li><li><p>Is the estimated
    cost (risk, money, time/energy) worth the estimated benefit?</p></li><li><p>Do
    independent smart experts (e.g. doctors) agree with the approach? Do they actually
    practice the approach themselves and with their families?</p></li><li><p>Do I
    track my objective/subjective metrics related to the tactic, if feasible?</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*6kat9U9JjIJEwkkUXSCB0Q.png" alt=""></p><p>I
    am actually very conservative and paranoid about these things. For example, I
    take months to research and talk with people before I decide to take a new compound,
    start with low doses, and consult with several independent experts. Be careful
    and don’t screw yourself up with this kind of thing.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*tRKkJz5VU4OG4eIhhYMrKQ.png"
    alt=""></p><h3>Objective:</h3><p>Get plenty of restorative deep and REM sleep
    on a regular basis.</p><h3>Key tactics:</h3><ul><li>Measure stages. I heard from
    private individuals that they compared a lot of devices with a proper sleep lab
    and the best device for measuring appears to be the Oura Ring. <a href="https://ouraring.com/">https://ouraring.com/</a>
    ; an example of measurements they give is below. I’m quite happy with my metrics,
    it seems I get a lot of deep sleep although my RHR/HRV used to be better, not
    sure why.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2860/1*PSReSH8IcUkKnD7fqsWNlw.png"
    alt=""></p><ul><li><p>Block blue light 3–4 hours before sleep. Here is an example
    of glasses that do that. <a href="https://gunnar.com/">https://gunnar.com/</a>
    (you want the orange-tinted versions)</p></li><li><p>Have your bedroom dark (as
    dark as possible, maybe use an eye mask), cold (18–19 celsius) and humid. Consider
    Chilipad, very useful. <a href="https://www.chilitechnology.com/">https://www.chilitechnology.com/</a></p></li><li><p>Wake
    at exactly the same time each morning. This is hard, but easier than going to
    sleep at the same time (which is just impossible).</p></li><li><p>Evaluate things
    that seem to help or disrupt sleep. You won’t be able to do a serious study but
    you can notice certain trends (e.g. for me even a small amount of alcohol is disruptive;
    late workouts lead to elevated heart rate etc.)</p></li></ul><p>This book has
    more info if you’d like to really dig in <a href="http://biohackingbook.com/">http://biohackingbook.com/</a>
    (you want the free chapter on sleep, I don’t like the other ones as much)</p><p>Sleep
    is essential to willpower, which is essential to everything else here.</p><p>Keep
    in mind that things in other sections will help a lot. In a future post I will
    dig into a lot more detail and describe my personal journey to better sleep.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*bBUpCK60Lg2XiRslodFWoQ.png" alt=""></p><h3>Objective:</h3><p>Eat
    good stuff. Don’t eat bad stuff. Habituate.</p><h3>Objective (sciencey version):</h3><p>minimize
    insulin levels, maximize glucose disposal, optimize various growth factors (IGF-1,
    mTOR etc.) towards things we want (e.g. muscle) and away from what we don’t want
    (e.g. cancer).</p><h3>Key tactics:</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*B0NnuvKTlKc4_doXxxkltg.png"
    alt=""></p><ul><li><p>Do not eat sugar in any form. Sugar is poison. This means
    no candy, fruit juices, bread, pasta, honey etc. There are many disagreements
    about nutrition science. That sugar is extremely bad for you is not one of them.</p></li><li><p>Do
    not eat processed foods. Eat natural food instead.</p></li><li><p>Do not eat cheap
    industrially-farmed animal products.</p></li><li><p>Eat mostly plants although
    I feel going entirely vegetarian for health reasons is not justified.</p></li><li><p>Eat
    organic when possible, especially when discussing animal products. Generally spend
    more money on food — the cheaper the food, the more “hacks” the producer used
    to be able to deliver that price. Many of these hacks are harmful — they inject
    saline solution to increase weight, feed dead animals to live animals, use antibiotics
    a lot etc.</p></li><li><p>In my opinion one shouldn’t drink any alcohol (screws
    up sleep) or add any salt (increases blood pressure) to food.</p></li><li><p>I
    do intermittent fasting where for 3 days a week I eat only once a day. You can
    search for this online, there appears to be a lot of research that suggests this
    is a good idea. It is also surprisingly easy after the first couple times.</p></li><li><p>I
    also try to eat ketogenic (high-fat-low-carb) but that is very, very hard to achieve.</p></li></ul><p><img

    compliance is generally incredibly hard and may take years to develop. Don’t try
    to do this all at once, it is too hard. Just try to make small steps to improve.
    I still occasionally eat bread or pasta or have a glass of wine.</p><p>In a future
    post, I will describe how I gradually, slowly and very painfully improved in this
    regard.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2028/1*t_ZkN_2MejVHeyH_pTjMkw.png"
    alt=""></p><h3>Objective:</h3><p>Maximize metabolic benefits (hormones, insulin
    sensitivity). Minimize time spent and risk of injury.</p><h3>Key tactics:</h3><ul><li><p>Warmup.
    I recommend these articles. Fortunate enough to know both Peter and Jesse and
    they describe it much better than I ever could. <a href="http://eatingacademy.com/personal/move-defines-live">http://eatingacademy.com/personal/move-defines-live</a>
    <a href="http://eatingacademy.com/personal/move-defines-live-part-ii">http://eatingacademy.com/personal/move-defines-live-part-ii</a></p></li><li><p>Spend
    majority of your gym time on hip-hinge exercises — deadlift, squat, leg press.
    The logic is that this activates the largest muscles in your body =&gt; much more
    gain than exercising small muscles (e.g. biceps). Important: hip-hinge exercises
    should be first practiced with a good personal trainer. They are risky because
    you can damage your lower back.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*6EXHaXvpgS-rzrIhEc3xKw.png"
    alt=""></p><ul><li><p>HIIT. Basically if you run, walk and do other constant-speed
    aerobics you should change to high-intensity intervals. They burn less muscle,
    spend less time, and deliver greater metabolic results. Look online, there is
    a lot of info about this.</p></li><li><p>Minimize sitting. Get a standing desk
    or something.</p></li></ul><p>I do the following:</p><ol><li><p>2–3x a week gym
    with 15 min warmup, 45 min hip-hinge exercise, 30–45 min other muscle groups in
    order of declining size.</p></li><li><p>2–3x a week on non-gym days 20-min HIIT
    run: 5 min warmup, 8 sets of 20–30 sec all-out, 60–90 sec walking, 5 min warmdown.
    If you do it right, you feel close to sick after this.</p></li></ol><p>I found
    gym to be one of the easiest routines to set up. Having personal trainers helped
    a lot. Now it is such an ingrained habit that I don’t need them anymore.</p><p><img

    alt=""></p><ul><li>Meditation. It definitely works. This deserves a separate post.
    But in short, I meditate daily, and found that it has significant benefits. The
    biggest is that recently I started to realize that the “self” and “free will”
    are cognitive illusions, and that makes it very easy to dissipate any negative
    moods, desires or emotions. I recommend the book Waking Up by Sam Harris here
    (as long as you are not an easily-offended religious person). <a href="https://www.samharris.org/waking-up">https://www.samharris.org/waking-up</a></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2052/1*3i9h9FFhwySoJcITYd9dsQ.png" alt=""></p><ul><li>Psychotherapy.
    Also a separate post. In short, I come to my therapist (who is also a Stanford/Harvard
    neurobiologist focused on helping high-performance people perform even better)
    with questions like “how do I enhance my intelligence?” “how do I eliminate bad
    mood days?” “how do I find it trivially easy to always chat with girls I find
    attractive?” etc. and we discuss concrete strategies based on research, other
    high-performer patients he sees etc. If you have not tried psychotherapy you really
    should, it is awesome.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ep8-9LFOq2TmAJ5xEf9Gyw.png"
    alt=""></p><ul><li>Never, ever lie about anything to anyone. Counterintuitive,
    but this seems to be a huge social hack and people like you a lot more if you
    always tell everyone the truth, no matter how embarrassing or hurtful. I used
    to lie a lot and am trying to completely stop. Also recommend the awesome short
    book “Lying” by Sam Harris which outlines this argument better than I ever could.

    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*1GAY042M6HfpgRku80kcDQ.png" alt=""></p><ul><li>For
    me, it took awhile to figure out what I want from sex. Eventually I realized there
    are two major disagreements I have with how society approaches it, and the key
    to mental health in my case is to say “fuck social norms,” and just do what you
    want (as long as all participants consent and nobody is hurt). Specifically:</li></ul><ol><li><p>I
    want to be public about my sexual habits, fetishes, porn preferences and the like
    because I believe they are nothing to be embarrassed of.</p></li><li><p>I want
    to be in relationships with awesome women I find extremely attractive, but at
    the same time openly (i.e. with everyone’s consent and participation) have sex
    with other women. Constant sexual novelty/excitement, emotional closeness and
    complete trust/transparency are all non-negotiable for me. Society says one can’t
    have it all in this regard. Personal experience and some knowledge of the intimate
    lives of other people clearly say otherwise.</p></li></ol><p>I don’t talk much
    about sense of purpose because I never lacked it. I don’t know how to help discover
    that.</p><p>Mental health is the most complex of all the things listed here, and
    is helped by all other sections. So there will be a lot of extra posts on this.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*qhr6_QxC8DI1joVD5cD8uA.png" alt=""></p><h3>Objective:</h3><p>Discover
    your bugs and fix them if possible. Everyone has bugs.</p><h3>Key tactics:</h3><ul><li><p>Blood
    testing.</p></li><li><p>Genetic testing.</p></li><li><p>Other (fat %, CIMT, heart
    tests, CGM, Toxins, microbiome, allergies). Some of these are useful already,
    some just fascinating but not clear in terms of actionables.</p></li></ul><p>I
    wrote a very detailed separate post that includes a huge number of tests I have
    done, how I interpret them etc. Read it here, I promise it is very interesting,
    and it lists hundreds of metrics I consider.

    is hard. This is a new field, the data is very complex, and if you really want
    to get value out of this, you have to spend a lot of time and effort. It is just
    the way it is.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2040/1*kIoXMhrz88TZeuYZb7_D3Q.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Also if you look at the testing post, you will see that:</p><ol><li><p>I
    have not screwed myself up despite all this stuff I do. My health seems to be
    exceptionally good across a large number of tests I have done, and in fact I appear
    to biologically be significantly younger than 32 if we use biomarkers as proxies
    for aging (interesting idea, but not enough data yet for rigorous predictions).</p></li><li><p>There
    is a lot of data out there that can help you understand your risks and how to
    fix them. It is important to know your metrics.</p></li></ol><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2004/1*B_9iTzbCDl0gH2-we-gEfg.png"

    tactics I use:</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*3v95llSv-WoTUv0JgV5_Jw.png"
    alt=""></p><ul><li>Metfromin. This is an anti-diabetes drug that lowers blood
    sugar without causing hypoglycemia. It appears to be beneficial in preventing
    cancer and heart disease and is currently in an FDA-approved trial as the first
    ever treatment for aging. It is extremely safe. I take 1gr morning / 1gr evening
    of the extended release version.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*eDQBzIl4kx8j2IdWk5Pp3g.png"
    alt=""></p><ul><li>Lithium. I use it as a mood stabilizer + as something that
    may have beneficial cognitive effects. I take ~100–150mg/day lithium carbonate
    in the evening. Lower doses are unlikely to have noticeable effects. Higher doses
    may start having negative effects. Lithium is toxic in high doses so something
    to be careful about.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*mWANGsSNZOAFnFKu0A63MQ.png"
    alt=""></p><ul><li>Modafinil. Excellent cognitive enhancer. I take 100–200mg/day.
    Just read this overview in Scientific American: <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-safe-drug-to-boost-brainpower/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-safe-drug-to-boost-brainpower/</a>;
    I have also taken Adderall for many years and found it to cause a lot of problems
    (anxiety and over-focus on the wrong things) so stopped.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2072/1*Wl5xEK7OVrmV3aOL4OhU6w.png"
    alt=""></p><ul><li>SSRI antidepressants. I take 10mg escitalopram daily. It makes
    everything just a little bit nicer and more enjoyable. That is worth a lot to
    me.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*wxlMnau4XuidvE9HKO-qRA.png"
    alt=""></p><ul><li><p>Thyroid hormones. I take 25mcg T4 + 20mcg T3. I have below-average
    thyroid hormones and had a noticeable improvement in mood, energy and cognitive
    function after I started.</p></li><li><p>Growth hormone. I take 0.5 ml of somatropin
    per day as morning injection. My IGF-1 is naturally very low (115–125) and this
    boosts it to a below-average 160–180. This is controversial because many people
    try to lower their IGF-1 in order to enhance cancer resistance. The reason I take
    it is that I decided I have more to gain by raising it a bit and getting better
    muscle growth/fat disposal. It also may have some cognitive and neuroprotective
    benefits.</p></li><li><p>Estrogen blockler. I take 50mg clomid 3x per week and
    cycle it on and off. The reason is that I have below-average-ish testosterone
    with very low LH/FSH. So that part is clearly a bottleneck, and voila — clomid
    significantly raises testosterone. I feel more energy and better mood. Also incredibly
    horny all the time :)</p></li><li><p>Phenibut (GABAph). Just started this and
    don’t really have any data, but subjectively it seems to make sleep a bit more
    restorative and enjoyable. docparsley.com is the supplement I use.</p></li></ul><p><img

    I will write a whole post about this later. I have only taken it once, and it
    has been a truly transformative experience that helped me get rid of a lot of
    social anxieties and become more extroverted and sexually liberated — all things
    I really wanted. The effects persist. MDMA is legal in a couple places in the
    world (e.g. Portugal) plus the FDA is currently running a trial on it for PTSD.
    It really ought to be legalized.</p></li><li><p><strong>LEGAL DISCLAIMER: DO NOT

    I take a bunch of other compounds that are non-pharmaceuticals. The general idea

    A top-notch medical research team I work with went through a large number of studies

    the middle probably useful, and no opinion on the ones at the bottom. None of
    these supplements were thought at all likely to be harmful.</p><p>Keep in mind:
    pharmaceuticals act very differently on different people. Some of these may be
    useless of harmful for you, even if they benefit me. I have gradually phased these
    in over years of self-experimentation and deep understanding of how they work.</p><p><img

    is a long journey. If you want to get value out of this it will take years. The

    think of medicine as “healing the sick.” But actually because who is sick is subjective,
    medicine can also upgrade healthy people on key dimensions. Simple example: I
    use nearly-invisible hearing aids despite having ok hearing. They boost my hearing
    to levels significantly above the average human. This can help formulate better
    responses in conversation, be more persuasive because you hear voice tones better,
    and many other things that give the user social advantages over others.</p></li></ul><p><img

    medicine could significantly increase social inequality beyond where it is now.</p><p>People
    like me will be able to pay for this out of pocket and use off-label prescriptions
    from private doctors who focus on upgrading and prevention rather than merely
    healing. Downstream the extra mood, energy, focus, health, willpower and social
    skills — enhanced over decades — will accrue further and further advantages to
    people who upgrade themselves, which will lead to a cycle of further concentration
    of wealth.</p><p>I don’t have any suggestions on this, just pointing out that
    this will be a far bigger problem than many other social-justice issues that get
    attention today.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*A0l1rkSfsQaaz3vKG0nEgQ.png"

    I noticed that very few people read the post about biomarkers. So decided to include
    it in full below.</h2><h2>Hundreds of biomarkers I test in pursuit of focus, health,
    energy, confidence and happiness.</h2><p>This post is an in-depth review of hundreds
    of biomarkers I test with real data and commentary — insulin resistance, hormones,
    ketones, microbiome, toxins, athletic capabilities, bodyfat, mercury, allergies
    and a lot more. The idea is to illustrate the biomarkers I check and ways I interpret
    them. I have no sense of privacy at all so feel free to use in whatever way you
    like.</p><p>This is meant to be read together with my main post on biohacking:

    interpretation at the end of this is that I am extremely healthy, much younger
    than my chronological age, perform much better than the vast majority of humans
    on many dimensions, and will live longer/healthier than anyone who has ever lived
    as of 2017.</p><p>Bold claims — partially designed to persuade you to read this
    long post :) Let’s jump into it.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*_1iOdcZa_31UAgX0rsTMIg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Cholesterols:</p><ul><li><p>All except Lp(a) in optimal territory,
    some significantly better. I should add that this is despite the fact that I eat
    an extremely high-fat ketogenic diet, so at least for me the idea that cholesterol
    raises cholesterol is clearly false.</p></li><li><p>Particle numbers are more
    important than milligrams / deciliter.</p></li><li><p>Lp(a) is an annoying genetic
    factor that helps blood clotting and significantly increases cardio risks. It
    can’t be fixed at the moment, but there are drugs on the horizon that target this
    and that I will take. This is the perfect illustration that we were designed for
    a different world where wounds were a greater risk than heart disease. And that
    it is time to take matters into our own hands.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*1gVD6S6yFIQv4eGXuxd4Vg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Excellent on inflammation markers — way better than suggested optima,
    CRP below detection limit. There is a lot of evidence that suggests inflammation
    is key in all major aging diseases (cancer, heart disease, neurodegenerative disease)
    so happy to see this. Everyone should know their inflammation markers.</p><p>Also
    great on endothelial function which is key for preventing heart disease.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*sTnZm8WWlpYiMy146Vw6uQ.png" alt=""></p><p>Here
    should mention some key genetics things you should be aware of, especially your
    ApoE (key to Alzheimers risk) and MTHFR (which is what screws up my B12 metabolism).</p><p>My
    TSH is actually not great, the lab is wrong to consider that optimal. Optimal
    is under 2, so my thyroid is working a bit harder than it should. Wrong lab range
    is partially because reference ranges are based on sick people.</p><p>You should
    know your Vitamin D and homocysteine. My Vitamin D started at around ~24 and I
    supplemented it up. My homocysteine started at ~12 and I supplemented it down
    into optimal territory with a lot of B-vitamins. Both markers have significant
    associations with key diseases</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*kOQOMHYfGyJrGLTFtVqayg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>(credit <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com">www.marksdailyapple.com</a>
    — a great blog about health!)</p><p>The screen above shows data compiled from
    a bunch of studies suggesting that relatively high levels of Vitamin D are protective
    against a number of diseases. It is very unlikely you will get to these levels
    without supplementing unless you are a lifeguard on a beach in Israel.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*uNjhY96mfuNChqMiu8CGUg.png" alt=""></p><p>Here
    the most important thing is that I have exceptional kidney function (eGFR and
    Cystatin-C) — in the top 5–10% of people in my age group. Especially important
    for me because all my supplements add workload on kidneys. eGFR is one of the
    key markers evaluated to calculate people’s “true biological age.”</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*_n26amYGQ4KPEQn-qYTt5A.png" alt=""></p><p>This
    all mostly has to do with insulin sensitivity which is one of the most key pathways
    in the body in terms of staving off aging and disease. My baseline glucose, insulin
    and HbA1c are actually not that great, but they don’t matter as much.</p><p>What
    matters the most is the OGTT (“Postprandial Evaluation” in the image above) —
    a test where you measure markers, then ingest a lot of fast sugar, then measure
    again couple more times after defined periods. This test shows the dynamics of
    how efficiently your body gets rid of sugar. In my case, it is extremely good
    — basically drinking 75mg of a very sugary solution has barely elevated my sugar,
    and then a small amount of insulin removed a huge amount of glucose out of my
    blood, taking me down to 46mg/dl. Most people would feel quite hypoglycemic here
    but I don’t because my sugar is constantly low and my body is used to it.</p><p>Alpha-hydroxybutyrate
    is raised because of my ketogenic diet.</p><p>Ferritin is fairly low because I
    eat well and give blood to do all these tests! This is quite key, especially for
    men. Lower iron is hypothesized to be one of the reasons why women live longer.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*S9iYFRyMNTFp1cCNq5HqqA.png" alt=""></p><p>OK,
    so more on insulin/glucose pathways. Sorry about the Russian in the images. Above
    is a test called RQ (respiratory quotient) of how much oxygen/co2 you process
    at rest (you basically put on a gas exchange mask that is also used for VO2max
    tests below, and sit calmly). What it tells me is that my body runs 85–100% entirely
    on fat, a little on protein, and not at all on carbs. Which is exactly what you
    want. I start using the carbs in my body as a dominant energy source only after
    I get to &gt;150 heartbeats/minute. This enhances athletic performance since glucose
    storage in the body is limited.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*0K2CB0cAYIaBo1fjQHaN5A.png"
    alt=""></p><p>(credit Peter Attia @ <a href="http://eatingacademy.com">http://eatingacademy.com</a>
    — great blog by one of the most knowledgeable people about preventative medicine
    in the world, in particular about insulin resistance and ketogenic diets)</p><p>If
    you read up about how cancer cells preferentially eat sugar, how ketogenic diets
    are more metabolically efficient and generate less waste byproducts per unit of
    energy etc., you will see that keeping your insulin/glucose pathways extremely
    optimized is an interesting opportunity for material life and healthspan extension.
    Not to mention body fat % reduction. This also deserves a whole separate post.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Fsj1WHsvLHVDnZ4BsyHPLQ.png" alt=""></p><p>On
    that note, here is my body fat graph. This was done in 33 separate measurements
    by the same personal trainer with the same equipment via measuring ~15 different
    sites for subcutaneous fat with calipers. This is error-prone. DEXA scans are
    better, but we didn’t have easy equipment access on a constant basis.</p><p>I
    think the absolute values are suspect, and bioimpedance suggests I am in the 10–11%
    range right now rather than ~7%. But the directional trend is very clear and encouraging.
    Also cool that I actually barely lost any weight, so I added a lot of muscle which
    has major health benefits (if you want a great detailed book on how muscle enhances
    your health, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Body-Science-Research-Program-Results-ebook/dp/B001NLL38S/">https://www.amazon.com/Body-Science-Research-Program-Results-ebook/dp/B001NLL38S/</a>).</p><p>I
    don’t good have before-and-after pics but I definitely used to be chubby, as all
    my friends and employees are delighted to keep reminding me :)</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*tOzVXYeKOKIKLuWS_bxr9g.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Also for those that are interested in ketogenic diets, you measure
    them via glucometers + ketometers similar to mine above. Be warned that keto blood
    strips are quite expensive. And that actually getting to a level of ketosis like
    mine above (after a ~16hr fast) will take a long time and a lot of work.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*n3c2xYHr2Vof3oZp8xO0FQ.png" alt=""></p><p>Also
    you can use CGM — an implant that tracks your glucose in real-time and sends data
    to your iphone. This can help figure out which exact foods, activities etc. alter
    your glucose and are harmful. The above image is from a night a couple years ago
    when I was stressed, stayed up late, and ate a lot of chocolate while sitting
    in a bathtub. Note how big the late-night jump is relative to the increase with
    good food around 6pm. This graph very clearly and unambiguously tells me “hey
    dude, you are fucking yourself by eating this sugary garbage. Like you just fucked
    yourself right now — look, let me show you in real-time how you are damaging your
    health!” Motivational stuff.</p><p>CGMs are very cool, but expensive (the Dexcom
    G5 I used was &gt;$4,000) and a huge hassle. I do think this is the future and
    plan to use them a lot though. Imagine real-time monitoring of testosterone connected
    to a pump that keeps it at optimal levels depending on time of day or activity!
    This is already feasible (albeit not with all molecules), someone just needs to
    engineer it.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vddwe3-bumw_2rRlVnri3Q.png"
    alt=""></p><p>OK, back to more blood testing! Some notes:</p><ul><li><p>My liver
    markers are great, which is also important in my case because of all the load
    my supplements and meds put on the liver. People often ask me how I know all these
    pills don’t screw up my liver. This is how I know.</p></li><li><p>Hormones deserve
    an entire separate post. Mine are not great, the hypothesis is that this is due
    to a childhood head trauma interfering with the pituitary’s function. For example
    my brother has very similar Lp(a), homocysteine etc problems, but he is much taller
    than me, which suggests childhood environmentally-driven growth hormone disruption.</p></li></ul><p>As
    I mention in my main framework post, I boost thyroid hormones, IGF-1 and testosterone.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*D-MRbp99WWyQavhEQ5woTg.png" alt=""></p><p>Testosterone
    deserves a special mention. In short, I have average-ish testosterone but low
    LH/FSH (which serve as inputs to testosterone). What controls FSH/LH is binding
    of estrogen at the pituitary gland. And because estrogen is a testosterone downstream
    product, there is a feedback loop.</p><p>So what I did is take an “estrogen blocker”
    which competitively occupies the same sites estrogen occupies at the pituitary,
    without inhibiting FSH/LH. The result can clearly be seen above — in a very short
    period of time (2 months), free testosterone jumped a lot. This has a noticeable
    effect on mood and energy. Also very noticeable effect on wanting to have sex
    all the time:)</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*6BQp7dmkDBzCa2g8N1dXqw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>This is a basic blood panel. Nothing too interesting, you basically
    just do these to make sure nothing is screwed up.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*iDFShDSxnCRqxzAJQCPQxA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>I have high EPA/DHA and Omega 3s in general + low Omega 6 and trans
    fats. Result of great diet + supplementation. This is basically what you want
    too.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*2ObRzrRDIJIJVggA8KzR3g.png"
    alt=""></p><p>OK, so in the graph above you can see I had elevated mercury and
    got rid of it. The hypothesis is that it is due to a dental amalgam. I fixed it
    by stopping eating any large predatory fish + enhancing liver detox capabilities
    via B-vitamins and the like.</p><p>Mercury is likely to interfere with a lot of
    neurobiological processes and contribute to many issues such as mood disorders.
    Good riddance.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*3B1TfiP7Fhi--U8Wm7A80w.png"
    alt=""></p><p>This is a CIMT test. It basically shows the thickness of your neck
    arteries, which appears to be very predictive of cardio risks a long time in advance.
    Another factor that suggests that my lifestyle approach is working. The cool thing
    is that this compares you with people in your own age demographic, so I know that
    unless something changes, I should have low cardio risk even when I am 85. Cool
    test, non-invasive, highly recommended.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*eyKTKMU0S1h18AlDcR7OmA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>VO2Max is a measure of how your body performs in terms of gas exchange,
    and as such evaluates the capabilities of your cardiovascular and pulmonary systems.
    You measure it by exercising while wearing respiratory gas analysis equipment
    as in the photo of me above. As the quotes from New York Times above highlight,
    it appears to significantly predict lifespan and “fitness age.”</p><p>My VO2Max
    has risen a lot over time and is very high, not far from Olympic medalist levels
    although I have just about zero athletic accomplishments. I mostly credit high-intensity
    interval training and weights training, but I don’t really know. More recently
    in a period when I stopped doing HIIT, I saw this metric worsen. Another good
    indicator that I’m doing something right though.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*70sJOwF31tOGdiJbpvTipA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The above is from a test called “GI Effects” by Genova Diagnostics.
    It tests your poop (which is very fun to mail) for bacteria, parasites, metabolites
    and a lot of other interesting things.</p><p>I think this is a very fascinating
    test, but I have no idea how to really use it yet beyond “do not take antibiotics,
    do take probiotics &amp; prebiotics”. Microbiome is a super exciting new frontier
    of health, but we don’t know whether certain microbes cause health states or simply
    correlate with them. If you want to learn more, take this great class on Coursera
    which I did and learned a lot from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/microbiome">https://www.coursera.org/learn/microbiome</a></p><p><a

    my latest entire test is linked to above. Now the entire internet knows exactly
    what bacterial strains live in my poop as of 2017. Enjoy :)</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*8v9dUy71O3HO1AS7TsFV5Q.png"
    alt=""></p><p>This is an interesting test (Genova Diagnostic Toxic Effects) that
    suggests somewhere I was getting significant exposure to VOCs (which are definitely
    bad for you). The actions I took were to enhance office/home ventilation, not
    eat/drink from plastic containers, not stand next to people who smoke.</p><p>On
    that last note, one time I took this test after smoking some pure-weed joints
    (which I do very rarely), and the toxins went off the charts high. If you can’t
    stop smoking, at least vape. Inhaling burned weed or tobacco is incredibly bad
    for you, I was shocked by the levels of toxic chemicals I saw in myself after
    just one evening of several joints.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Uh_GhmaONRbmnQNcl02wRA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>This is from two tests of allergies/sensitivities by Cyrex. The
    reason I took it is that if you eat products you are sensitive to, you may increase
    inflammatory activity in the body which we do not want.</p><p>My takeaways are
    that I shouldn’t eat tuna or scallops, and that I am allergic to certain molds.
    Also that I appear to have a clearly-acquired gelatin sensitivity because of all
    the capsules I take. Fascinating.</p><p>Other interesting tests/metrics:</p><ul><li><p>Resting
    heart rate at night. You can measure via the Oura ring or many other devices.
    Mine is around 55 which is ok, but not great. Kind of irritates me that it isn’t
    better :)</p></li><li><p>heart rate variability is an interesting metric that
    appears to be correlated with health even more than RHR, although I have no idea
    how to interpret it at this point.</p></li><li><p>Blood pressure. Should ideally
    be on the low end. Mine is typically around 100/60. Can be improved by eating
    less salt + drinking hibiscus tea, as well as by a lot of the other lifestyle
    things I list.</p></li></ul><p>There are many other tests I have done, but this
    is already an incredibly long post.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*5A6Q4XvJ8rOJuwPN8qtAgw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The key takeaways are that:</p><ol><li><p>I have not screwed my
    health up despite all this crazy stuff I do. In fact, my health seems to be exceptionally
    good across a large number of tests I have done — a lot of age-correlated markers
    suggest I am closer to 20 years old, even though I am 32. The markers are also
    continuing to improve. This suggests I am doing something right.</p></li><li><p>There
    is a lot of data out there that can help you understand your risks and how to
    fix them. It is important to know your metrics.</p></li></ol><p>Also here is a
    framework I like using. Below are all-age causes of death in the US. My markers
    suggest that I am at extremely low risk for a large number of them, <strong>even
    in my age group</strong>. So if I maintain a similar set of behaviors (and actually
    I keep improving every year) I should have low risks in my age group when I am
    80 as well unless something screws up.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2108/1*t9MCT_Ota9Zc9sgrE8HJZQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>With the above framework I also identified that my key risk is cancer
    — which is why I am so focused on low sugar and insulin (which appear to feed
    cancer preferentially, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warburg_hypothesis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warburg_hypothesis</a>)
    and my immune system which is somewhat weaker due to CMV, so very interested in
    iP stem cell therapies that could replenish naive lymphocytes.</p><p>I expect
    that even without major medical progress, I will be in excellent mental/physical
    condition at 100 and will live longer than any human who has ever lived as of
    2017. With tech progress, it seems likely that immortality is reachable.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*xxvQYKSKPZMHpI5PhI4q4w.png" alt=""></p><p>I
    could be wrong, but I suspect that today there are fewer than 1000 people out
    of 7 billion who know as much about their own health as I do. Because of how onerous,
    expensive, and non-intuitive this is.</p><p>But this should become much more mainstream.
    It really does give you a significant advantage in life across very many areas
    — thanks to this, I often feel “superhuman” because of how much control I have
    over my health and behavior relative to what I see in other people. And humans
    tend to adopt things that enhance their social competitiveness.</p><p>I am happy

  :content: <p>It will make your productivity plummet</p><p>Perhaps you’ve heard of
    so-called “functional” programming. Maybe you’ve even been wondering whether you
    should try it next.</p><p>The short answer is <em>hell no!</em></p><p>Functional
    programming is full of flaws, is not suitable for real-world projects, and will
    make your productivity plummet. Why? Keep reading to find out!</p><h2>Functional

    enterprise software demands a complex set of rigorous and compulsory requirements
    pertaining to the expected amount of embedded abstractions within the software
    solution. In other words, object-oriented programming enables the programmer to
    utilize multiple mechanisms of abstraction that fully satisfy the complex requirements
    demanded by the enterprise.</em></p><p>That was a mouthful, but bear with me!
    Things will become crystal-clear in a moment.</p><p>So-called “functional” programming
    has no proper mechanism of abstraction since it is based on mathematics (which
    obviously is inferior and has no applications in the real world apart from academia).
    Unlike OOP, functional programming makes no attempt to fulfill the numerous rigorous
    and complex requirements demanded by the enterprise.</p><p>This code snippet to
    demonstrates the issues prevalent with functional programming:</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/9a687be05e5999d4b07d0fca54048060"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>If this makes you angry, you’are not alone!</p><p>Functional
    programming makes no attempt to properly abstract and encapsulate the functionality,
    as typically is demanded by any serious enterprise.</p><p>No self-respecting software
    engineer would ever write anything like this! If they do, then immediately they
    should be fired by any seriously large enterprise to prevent further damage. In
    the next section, we’ll take a look at a properly abstracted OOP program.</p><h2>Functional

    no secret that the foremost duty of any professional and self-respecting software
    engineer is to write future-proof code that satisfies complex business requirements.</p><p>In
    contrast with the disastrous functional code snippet above, let’s take a quick
    look at a properly abstracted OOP program. It does the same thing, but in an abstract
    and a future-proof way:</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/3c30a59c0be7ad784a1358a0110c172a"

    properly abstracted. This code is <em>solid</em>.</p><p>Don’t let the simplicity
    fool you! It completely fulfills all of the complex business requirements that

    solution is completely future-proof, and properly makes use of enterprise-grade
    dependency injection.</p><h2>Serious Management Needs Serious Features</h2><p><img

    by now the development team has fulfilled the complex business requirements pertaining
    to code abstraction, as set forth by the enterprise. The developer resources should
    now shift focus towards implementing the features defined by the project managers.</p><p>As
    any real-world enterprise product manager knows, only new features delivered have
    real business value. They shouldn’t be allowed to waste their resources on time-wasters
    like unit-testing and refactoring.</p><p>It is obvious that so-called “functional”
    programming is flawed, it makes redundant things like refactoring and unit testing
    unnecessarily easy. This, in turn, will act as a distraction to the development
    team — they might accidentally waste time on those useless activities, instead
    of delivering new features.</p><p>This example clearly demonstrates the inferiority
    of functional programming — it makes refactoring too easy:</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/33abe53c5b7a1ad6d905351860dc6078"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>If such refactoring makes you cringe from its simplicity,
    then you’re not alone! Six lines of code before the refactor, and only seven lines
    of code after? You must be kidding me!</p><p>Let’s contrast it with a proper refactor
    of object-oriented code:</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/7e398b2e14ca17072f3e7f0b9cafd223"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>That’s what proper programming looks like! Nine lines
    of code before, and 22 after. There’s more effort required to refactor, which
    will make the enterprise developer resources think twice before engaging in such
    wasteful activity as refactoring.</p><h2>The Fallacy of Declarative Code</h2><p><img

    Herrmann</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>The
    so-called “functional” programmers erroneously pride themselves in writing declarative
    code. That’s nothing to be proud of — such code merely creates an illusion** **of
    productivity.</p><p>The core responsibility of any developer should consist of
    thinking about proper rigorous object-oriented abstractions (as also demanded
    by any seriously large enterprise).</p><p>Let’s take a look at properly abstracted
    OOP code:</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/3b59513cc210d4d96d702a3dd30c232a"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>Please focus on the imperative loop at line 20. Ignore
    the minor boilerplate OOP code, unrelated to the task at hand. It had to be included
    in order to make the code sample adhere to the rigorous abstraction requirements
    set forth by the serious enterprise.</p><p>Declarative code, on the other hand,
    is too concise, and erroneously makes the developers focus on the less important
    things, like business logic. Contrast the robust enterprise solution described
    above to a snippet of inferior “declarative” code:</p><pre><code>SELECT * FROM
    Users WHERE Country=’USA’;</code></pre><p>SQL makes me cringe every single time
    because of being declarative. Why SQL? Why can’t they have the developers make
    use of proper enterprise-grade abstractions and write normal object-oriented code?
    Especially when we already have those tools at our disposal. It’s mind-blowing.</p><h2>Real
    World Modelling</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/10368/1*EwSXqvKmlIJXlEAv7cizRQ.jpeg"

    Programming is genius. Unlike “functional” programming, it perfectly models the
    real world with advanced techniques like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.</p><p>Any
    self-respecting software developer should be making use of inheritance on a daily
    basis to achieve code reusability. As I said earlier, inheritance perfectly models
    the real world. Cats, for example, always inherit their properties and behaviors
    from a single abstract real-world animal. Life originated in the ocean a few billion
    years ago. Therefore all mammals (including the cats) have inherited the properties
    of the primordial fish, like garfield.fishHead, and their methods like garfield.swim
    and garfield.layCaviar. No wonder cats enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQZtk-fCWQ4">bathing</a>
    and swimming so much! Humans are actually the same, we can easily start laying
    caviar if we want to!</p><p>Our programs should always follow similar hierarchical
    approaches to code organization. Functional programming erroneously rids the developers
    of such amazing code sharing constructs inspired by the real world. This has far-reaching
    consequences, especially in seriously complex enterprise software.</p><h2>Functions
    Should Always be Bound to Objects</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9584/1*dhgHI3diCVPA2JWYYqnWRA.jpeg"

    is just common sense and also perfectly models the real world. The notebook you
    buy at Chapters comes with a built-in “write method”. This method is to be called
    whenever you’re planning to write things down. You may not realize this, but you
    also have methods like .eat(veggies), doHomeWork . This is just common sense,
    how else would your mom be able to make you eat your veggies and have you complete
    your homework? Of course, she used to call those methods directly!</p><p>No job
    in the real world can be done without hiring a dedicatedManager that coordinates
    tasks. Young people probably need a manager to satisfy their basic human needs,
    you know, things like “netflix-n-chill”. Who is going to coordinate the entire
    process, after all? If they’re smart, then they’d hire multiple managers, just
    like OOP recommends.</p><p>In the real world, creating anything new and cool also
    requires having a dedicated Factory. Leonardo owned a MonaLisaFactory , Trump
    builds a secretWallFactory. Russia used to have a CommunismFactory , and nowadays
    mainly maintains itsCorruptionFactory, hidden somewhere deep within the dungeons
    of Kremlin.</p><p>One can clearly see that this is just another nail in the “functional”
    coffin since it makes no attempt to model the real world. The functions are allowed
    to exist separately from objects, which is plain wrong. Functional programming,
    obviously, is unsuitable for any serious real-world coding.</p><h2>Functional

    and foremost, software engineers should focus on constant improvement and growth.
    A vast amount of knowledge has to be acquired by a software engineer in order
    to truly master Object-Oriented Programming.</p><p>First, they’d have to learn
    advanced OOP techniques like inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
    Then they should familiarize themselves with a multitude of design patterns (like
    the Singleton), and start making use of them in their code. There about 30 basic
    design patterns that have to be learned. Ideally, somewhere around this point,
    the developer should start making use of various enterprise-grade abstraction
    techniques in their code.</p><p>The next step is to get familiar with techniques
    like Domain-Driven Design and to learn to break down the monolith. It is also
    recommended to learn proper refactoring tools, like Resharper, since OOP code
    is not trivial to refactor.</p><p>It takes at least 20–30 years to get good with
    OOP. Even then most people with 30 years of OOP experience haven’t truly mastered
    it. The learning path is rough, filled with uncertainty. A lifetime of learning
    awaits the OOP developer, how exciting is that?</p><p>What about the poor functional
    programmers? Unfortunately, there’s not much to learn. I have personally taught
    a few junior developers functional programming in JavaScript, and they became
    really good at it in about half a year. They simply had to understand a few basic
    concepts and then learned to apply them pretty quickly. Where’s the thrill of
    lifetime learning? I wouldn’t envy them.</p><h2>Success is a Journey, Not a Destination</h2><p><img

    Maragos</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>Let’s
    admit it, we programmers are being paid for our time. Just as the construction
    workers who’ve been digging holes not far from my house for the past two years
    (btw they’re building a ̶w̶a̶l̶l road).</p><p>Let’s define programmer productivity.
    Everyone who has worked in any seriously large enterprise knows the simple formula
    for success:</p><pre><code>productivity = lines_of_code x bugs_fixed</code></pre><h3>Bugs
    Fixed</h3><p>Human brains are really bad at working with state, we can only hold
    about five items in our working memory at a given time. State in programming usually
    refers any data in memory — e.g. fields/variables in OOP. Working with mutable
    state is very similar to juggling. I don’t know too many people who can juggle
    three balls, let alone five.</p><p>OOP makes good use of this weakness. Almost
    everything is mutable in OOP. Thank god that OOP takes the matter of developer
    productivity seriously! In OOP all of the mutable state is also shared by reference!
    This means that you not only have to think about the mutable state of the object
    that you currently are working with, you also have to think about the mutable
    state of 10–50 of other objects that it interacts with! This is akin to trying
    to juggle 50 balls at the same time, and also has the added benefit of acting
    as a really good exercise for our brain-muscle.</p><p>Bugs? Yes, eventually we
    will drop some of the balls that we’ve been juggling. We will maybe miss some
    smallish details from the interaction of those 50 objects. But who cares, really?
    Bugs should be reported by customers in production, that’s how any seriously large
    enterprise works. Then the bugs go into the JIRA backlog (serious enterprise-grade
    software as well). A few years from now the bugs will be fixed. Problem solved!</p><p>God,
    I love using my mobile banking app. It is very advanced, the bank values my business
    and they take my privacy seriously. The bugs are just features (I was told)!</p><p>So-called
    “functional” programming erroneously isolates state and makes the state immutable.
    This has an unfortunate consequence of reducing complexity, and thus reducing
    the number of bugs. Having fewer bugs in the codebase means that we will have
    fewer bugs to fix. Contractors won’t be able to keep charging their clients for
    those bug fixes. Developers working in any seriously large enterprise will start
    looking bad in the eyes of their managers, while seriously jeopardizing their
    chances of success within the organization.</p><h3>Lines of Code</h3><p>We should
    also be able to show continuous progress to our management. And what is the most
    effective way to show progress? Lines of code, of course! Had we all switched
    to functional programming, we’d make the management very upset and suspicious.
    The “declarative” code would have made our code more concise, and the lines of
    code would decrease drastically. Up to 3–5 times less code to achieve the exact
    same goal, this is unacceptable!</p><p>In other words, our productivity would
    plummet in the face of serious enterprise management, and our jobs once again
    would be put in jeopardy. It is in our best interests to stay away from the “functional”
    programming.</p><p>The same advice applies to the contractors who charge their
    clients for hours worked. Here’s a simple formula for success:</p><pre><code>lines_of_code
    = time_to_write = $$$pure_profit$$$</code></pre><p>This formula for success, of
    course, also directly applies to the serious software contractors who get paid
    for the lines of code:</p><pre><code>if (1 == &#39;1&#39;) {  doStuff();} else
    {  // pure profit}</code></pre><h3>Spaghetti is Our Bread and Butter</h3><p>Unlike
    Functional Programming, OOP offers us a consistent way to write spaghetti code
    — a real boon to developer productivity. Spaghetti code equates to more billable
    hours, which translates to pure profit for the serious OOP engineers. Spaghetti
    doesn’t only taste delicious, it is the bread and butter of OOP programmers!</p><p>Object-orientation
    is a true boon for contractors and employees of serious enterprise alike.</p><h2>Bug

    should not fear using OOP. Once again, those pesky bugs are nothing to worry about!
    Any serious enterprise has an entire bug prevention department (aka customer support),
    whose main job is to protect their developer resources from angry customers. It’s
    the customer’s fault that they can’t use the app properly, after all.</p><p>The
    developers should not be bothered with such irrelevant things as bug reports.
    This ensures that none of the enterprise resources are wasted, and allows the
    developers to focus on implementing new features while making use of proper enterprise-grade
    object-oriented abstractions and complex design patterns.</p><h3>Bug Report Process</h3><p>An
    elaborate and rigorous process is typically put in place to protect enterprise
    resources. Once a customer has encountered a bug, they typically have to look
    for the customer support phone number online. Then the customer is presented with
    an advanced and interactive phone menu consisting of various options. It usually
    takes two to five minutes to listen to the menu and select the correct option.
    The least persistent customers usually fall off at this step.</p><p>Then the customer
    is usually told that the company is experiencing an “unexpectedly large volume
    of calls”, and that “the average wait time is 56 minutes”. They usually apologize
    for the inconvenience and mention how much they value the business of the customer.
    Most of the customers will usually decide not to report the bug at this step.
    To keep the customer entertained, inspirational music typically is being played.
    They’re also told to check out the awesome new app. The app that the customer
    was having trouble with in the first place.</p><p>After the 56-minute wait is
    over, the call gets routed to a call center located somewhere in The Northern
    Americas. The local American employees typically go through rigorous training
    that enables them to speak with a thick Indian or Bulgarian accent. The agent
    mentions that the app in question is not his responsibility but happily will transfer
    the client to another department.</p><p>After another 42 minute wait, an agent
    happily tells the customer that this bug actually is a feature, and recommends
    the user to go through the help section of the app. If the customer is still being
    persistent, the agent might create a support ticket and the customer might even
    hear back! The bug can’t be reproduced.</p><p>I hope by now you are convinced,
    that worrying about bugs is not the job of a developer. Serious measures are typically
    put in place by the enterprise to protect their developer resources.</p><h2>Avoid

    the “functional” nonsense from your resume or nobody will take you seriously.
    Nobody in the real enterprise world is trained in childish things like “function
    composition”, “purity”, “monads” or “immutability”. You don’t want to look like
    an outsider. Speaking about such things will make your interviewer appear dumb,
    and will completely annihilate your chances of success.</p><p>The enterprise technical
    recruiters also go through mandatory rigorous training, which enables them to
    properly differentiate between serious technologies like Java and JavaScript.</p><p>Be
    sure to sprinkle words throughout your resume that demonstrate your extensive
    knowledge of the various rigorous enterprise-grade abstraction techniques like
    classes, inheritance, design patterns, dependency injection, SOLID, abstract factory,
    and singleton.</p><p>When asked to implement the classical FizzBuzz job interview
    problem on the whiteboard, make sure that you come well-prepared. This is your
    opportunity to shine and demonstrate your rigorous enterprise-grade system design
    abilities. Your first step is to adequately design the solution while making use
    of proper OOP design patterns and rigorous enterprise-grade abstraction techniques.
    <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition">FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition</a>
    is a good starting point. Many make the rookie mistake of relying on inferior
    design techniques like functions. No wonder they never hear back from the potential

    considered all of the serious and rigorous arguments above, one can now clearly
    see that nothing good ever came out of this so-called “functional” programming.
    It’s clear it should be avoided at all costs.</p><p>The so-called “functional”
    programming was a fad of the last couple of years. It’s good that it is already
    going away! The big fish like Facebook and Microsoft have long ago realized the
    limitations of functional programming and the clear superiority of object-oriented
    approaches to code organization. They’re shifting their resources towards a new
    generation of object-oriented languages, namely <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/">ReasonOL</a>

  :title: 'Finally Getting in Shape: The Japanese Rule to a Healthy Diet'
  :content: '<p>I’m no biohacker, but I have a profound interest in nutrition, food,
    and how we can optimize our health and well-being. So of course, I always read
    and watch a lot of videos on new research surrounding diets like the ketogenic
    diet, intermittent fasting, paleo, and anything else that claims to be the key
    to optimizing our health.</p><p>Most recently, I tried intermittent fasting for
    7 days. To be fair, I’m no licensed nutritionist and my diet was developed over
    my own research online. Here are some details on how I pursued it:</p><p><strong>When
    I Ate:</strong></p><ul><li>There are multiple ways to intermittent fast, and multiple
    levels of strictness and control, but basically I just skipped breakfast and dessert
    for a week, ate an early dinner, and focused on eating whole foods.</li></ul><p><strong>What
    I Ate:</strong></p><ul><li><p>While I mainly focused on the time frame of when
    I was eating, rather than what I was eating, I was still careful to incorporate
    lots of vegetables and protein to maximize “fullness” without overeating.</p></li><li><p><em>Typical
    meal: Broccoli (boiled), 3 eggs, pan-roasted edamame with chili garlic and cumin,
    bread, hummus, and an apple, with lots of water.</em></p></li></ul><p><strong>What
    Happened:</strong></p><ul><li><p>*<em>First 24 Hours: *</em>I feel great! A little
    hungry before going to bed, but that’s probably because I don’t have dessert sitting
    in my stomach (I was used to treating myself to half a bar of dark chocolate,
    250g, or recently, a piece of pineapple cake that my little sister sent me from
    Taiwan)</p></li><li><p><strong>72 Hours:</strong> I am finding that I am SCARFING
    down all of my meals, because I am so hungry. I would feel incredibly full after
    lunch or dinner, but find myself really hungry again after an hour. I consider
    that I am not eating enough calorie-dense foods. Will add more bread and butter
    to my meals. Generally, I feel pretty good about what I’m doing and can see myself
    continuing this long-run with a few adjustments.</p></li><li><p>*<em>5 Days: *</em>I
    am still hungry all of the time, even after adding more calorie-dense foods to
    my meals. I have a constant headache, feel groggy, and emotionally don’t feel
    so good. I will go from feeling great to feeling really low, and am looking forward
    to the end of the week. I also find myself constantly thinking about food, even
    while I’m eating.</p></li><li><p><strong>7 Days:</strong> Let this end.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>The
    verdict? It doesn’t work and I absolutely hate it.</p><p>I am no expert or scientist
    and I am just an amateur when it comes to food nutrition, so maybe I didn’t do
    this diet perfectly as prescribed. But if you’re experiencing these signs, I’m
    thinking this diet is not sustainable in the long-run.</p><ul><li><p>Headaches</p></li><li><p>Negative
    emotions</p></li><li><p>Fatigue</p></li><li><p>Grogginess</p></li><li><p>Thinking
    about food all of the time</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*NP_bmQxcOigBukDMXpX3wQ.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>In addition to intermittent fasting, I’ve also tried other popular
    diet prescriptions with mixed results, with none of them being long-lasting or
    sustainable.</p><h2><strong>So what is the correct way to eat?</strong></h2><p>How
    do we take control of our diet and optimize our health and well-being for the
    long run? For years, I’ve been following a single rule that has been a staple
    value in my house that I have found is the only one that works for me. It’s not
    intermittent fasting, it’s not keto, and it’s not paleo. Not only has my single
    rule helped me lose weight, but it’s improved my mood, energy, and overall well-being.
    It’s something my mother had taught me, and the whole of Japan knows about it
    too. It’s called: <em>Harahachi-bunme</em></p><p><strong>What is* Harahachi-bunme*?</strong></p><p>Basically,
    if you tell any Japanese person that this is a kind of diet, they’ll look at you
    in a very confused way, and correct you that it’s not really. It’s a long-standing
    Japanese saying that directly translates to “8/10ths your stomach”; meaning, you
    should only eat until you are 80% full.</p><p>It follows very simple principles
    that we should not overindulge in food, and we should be modest about how much
    we eat. Neither starving nor stuffing ourselves, it follows the principle that
    extreme lifestyles are neither good for us nor sustainable, and the key is finding
    balance and a middle ground to satisfy our needs.</p><p>It’s a way of looking
    at food and hunger in an intuitive way, with a focus on nourishment and health
    rather than results like weight-loss or physical benchmarks. These benchmarks
    tend to come naturally over time anyways, because when you practice neither over-indulgent
    eating nor deprivation, your body will respond in a sustainable manner that will
    last you the rest of your life. You must trust that your body knows what it needs.</p><p><img

    typical Japanese teishoku meal"><em>A typical Japanese teishoku meal</em></p><h2>How
    to practice <em>Harahachi-bunme</em></h2><p>Basic guidelines behind the principle</p><p><strong>Eat
    when you are hungry.</strong></p><ul><li>For some days this means eating two meals.
    For other days, it means eating four. Days following an intense day of exercise
    may mean you eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, and snacks in-between. For
    a day of travel and lots of idle sitting, it could mean just one large meal and
    many snacks throughout the day.</li></ul><p><strong>Eat whole, nutrient-dense
    foods.</strong></p><ul><li><p>While not strictly in the saying, harahachi-bunme
    only works when you are eating healthy, nutrient-dense foods. Your body cannot
    accurately measure nourishment and hunger when you are consuming mostly empty
    calories from highly-processed foods. These empty calories lead to overeating
    because you are never able to reach the point of “80% full”. Focus on fruits,
    vegetables, proteins, and whole grains, and your stomach and brain will respond
    accordingly to your needs.</p></li><li><p>By focusing on these kinds of foods,
    you will not only stop hunger pangs, but you will also lose the desire to mindlessly
    eat. Preventing overindulgence will not be a test of willpower, but will become
    a natural response.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Don’t worry about counting or measuring
    things — your body will know</strong></p><ul><li><p>Just eat fruits, vegetables,
    proteins, and whole grains.</p></li><li><p>Is it really that simple? Shouldn’t
    you think about the composition of your macros? How about how these foods are
    cooked? Should it be raw or boiled or baked or pan-fried? This over-excessive
    thinking is what leads to extreme diets. Our bodies are thoughtful and well-run
    machines, and there is no need to obsessively consider these details. Trust your
    body, it will respond appropriately.</p></li><li><p>Tracking micro details won’t
    really be sustainable in the long-run, unless you really enjoy dedicating mental
    energy to thinking about food in this sort of manner (and some people do!). For
    most of us though, just focus on consuming whole foods, limit your refined carbs,
    and your body will know the rest.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Stop when you’re 80%
    full.</strong></p><ul><li><p>This is the most important part, as it guarantees
    how we develop a positive and sustainable relationship with food.</p></li><li><p>There
    are no concrete rules to how you will know when you’re 80% full, but as a guideline,
    I like to eat slowly, and wait at least 30 minutes after eating a full meal to
    determine how I feel. Everyone has different lifestyles and body compositions,
    so it may be difficult to determine what this looks and feels like at first. But
    be patient, feel in tune with what your body is telling you, and if it’s signaling
    hunger, eat. If it’s telling you nothing, don’t eat.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Get
    food off your mind.</strong></p><ul><li>As you practice harahachi-bunme, the idea
    of food should fall to the back of your mind. Stop obsessing over it, and think
    of it as another part of enjoying a fulfilling life. Food should be a part of
    what makes life interesting and enjoyable, but should not be the focus. This practice
    is the most difficult part to attain, and it is the part which will take the most
    time, particularly if you’ve had a problematic or complicated relationship with
    food in the past. But once you reach a point where it can fall back in your mind
    and take a backseat, your mental energy can be reallocated and opened to many
    more interesting life experiences and ideas that aren’t related to diet.</li></ul><p>With
    this perspective shift and change in relationship with food, living will not be
    about eating, but eating will become the fuel and sustenance for a fulfilling
    lifestyle, focused on your family, friends, career, and success.</p><p>Harahachi-bunme
    is not really a diet, and to be honest, it’s not even really a rule. It’s a way
    of intuitive eating and understanding food from a perspective of nourishment and
    sustenance.</p><p>I’ve gone from both ends of the extreme eating spectrum, and
    found that I was neither happy nor productive in either state. Moderation can
    be a lot more difficult than said, but once you master the art of it, your brain
    capacity really does open up for better things.</p><p>So get in touch with your
    thoughts, and get in touch with your body. Love it, nourish it, and treasure it.
    You will feel physically better, emotionally happier, and psychologically more
    engaged with your work and the people around you.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*cHX34umPiyAVIBJTX-RVZA.jpeg"

  :title: Trump Is a Mental Health Story
  :content: '<p>Trump Is a Mental Health Story</p><h3>Reporters need to stop covering
    him as if he’s strictly a political one</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/11136/1*ls3KJhtB8M_4Ndk5B5g7ig.jpeg"
    alt="Credit: JIM WATSON / Contributor/Getty Images"><em>Credit: JIM WATSON / Contributor/Getty
    Images</em></p><p>In the 818 days since the 2016 election, the *Washington Post
    *has used the word “unprecedented” in reference to President Donald Trump, or
    his associates, about 657 times­ — or almost every day. On just one day in January,
    for example, readers learned of Trump’s “unprecedented steps” to slow immigration,
    his “unprecedented decision” to hold onto his business in the White House, and
    his “unprecedented assault” on the census.</p><p>There is a breathlessness to
    the coverage that, oddly, does not diminish with time. The word “remarkable” appears
    almost as often in the <em>Post</em>, averaging every other day since 2016. We
    read about the “remarkable rift” between the President and his former National
    Security Adviser (Dec. 1, 2017), Trump’s “remarkable ignorance of U.S. history”
    (July 19, 2018), and his “remarkable tweetstorm” against his former lawyer (Dec.
    4, 2018).</p><p>If something happens that often, it can’t be all that remarkable.
    Why do journalists keep using these words? Simple. Because any time news breaks,
    we call political scientists, pollsters, former White House staffers, and opponents
    for analysis, little of which is remotely illuminating. The problem is, we try
    to cover Trump as a political matter. And by doing so, we’re potentially missing
    a big part of the story.</p><p>Imagine if Trump had a seizure during a press conference.
    Would reporters ring up the folks at Brookings and the Cato Institute for comment?
    Would we analyze <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/upshot/trump-border-wall-polls.html">new
    polling data</a> to help us understand if there is a clever political strategy
    behind his behavior?</p><blockquote><h1>“His behavior is not remarkable. It’s
    predictable. It’s exactly what we’d expect. He just continues to be a consistent
    version of who he appears to be.”</h1></blockquote><p>No. We’d call physicians,
    who would tell us that they can’t formally diagnose the president without seeing
    him, but they can say that a seizure is generally caused by an uncontrolled electrical
    disturbance in the brain. They could then explain that a seizure might be caused
    by epilepsy — and what might happen if epilepsy goes untreated. This context would
    not be inappropriate or biased; it would demystify the president’s behavior and
    help us prepare for what comes next, with significantly less drama and noise.</p><p>So,
    I tried an experiment the other day. To make sense of Trump’s behavior, I did
    not call foreign policy experts or pundits. That would be like calling an astrologer
    to explain a flu pandemic. Instead, I called Wendy Behary, who wrote the book
    <em>Disarming the Narcissist *and has treated hundreds of narcissistic clients,
    including surgeons, Wall Street executives, and other powerful people, in her
    private practice in New Jersey</em>. *It was one of the most useful conversations
    I’ve had about Trump in months.</p><p>Unlike the <em>Washington Post *or the <a
    href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/us/politics/trump-whitaker-press-attacks-midterms.html">*New
    York Times</a>,</em> Behary has never once been surprised by Trump’s behavior.
    “His behavior is not remarkable. It’s predictable. It’s exactly what we’d expect,”
    she says. “He just continues to be a consistent version of who he appears to be.”</p><p>So
    far, most of the mainstream stories about Trump’s narcissism have been about whether
    mental health professionals should diagnose him from afar. That’s a worthy debate.
    But journalists are not psychiatrists. We are not bound by the rules of the American
    Psychiatric Association. We are bound by a duty to inform the public, without
    fear, drawing upon any source that may prove useful.</p><p>At this point, it’s
    not biased to acknowledge that Trump behaves in ways that most mental health professionals
    recognize as symptomatic of a larger problem. It’s not unreasonable to ask them
    to help explain and even predict his behavior. In fact, it may be more biased
    <em>not</em> to do so.</p><p>What if we got new sources to help us through this
    “remarkable” time? This doesn’t mean bashing Trump. To the contrary. In order
    to treat her narcissistic clients, Behary has learned to empathize with them.
    This isn’t easy to do, she admits, but it is essential — so that she doesn’t mistake
    them for being strategic or simply evil. “Narcissists don’t set out to harm people,”
    she says. “They will harm you — but it’s to protect themselves. It’s not personal.”
    Taking narcissists personally is a very common waste of time and energy.</p><p>Narcissists,
    for example, need admiration the way addicts need substances. They believe they
    are truly special and yet not appreciated for their gifts, which can lead them
    to act entitled, as if the rules do not apply to them. In their quest for recognition,
    they sometimes exploit others, contradict what they’ve said, and break their promises
    — all the while arguing for (and often truly believing in) their new, alternative
    facts. Once we know this, Trump’s tendency to revise history becomes unsurprising
    and explicable.</p><p>It’s a painful way to live, because no amount of adoration
    will ever be enough. After every victory, feelings of envy, anger, and frustration
    squirm back to the surface. Now, Behary says, Trump is “unraveling.” This, too,
    is predictable, which is why we need to talk about it, out in the open. As the
    bad news stacks up for Trump, including Republican losses in the midterms, a divided
    Congress, and continuing legal investigations, he is likely experiencing profound
    mental agony.</p><p>In this agitated state, narcissists are notoriously bad at
    negotiating, as it turns out. (They are good at bullying, which is not the same
    thing.) Catherine Conner, a family law attorney and mediator in Northern California,
    understands this better than political scientists, because she has helped hundreds
    of people craft child custody agreements and divorce settlements. A crisis, such
    as a divorce, may intensify narcissistic tendencies and make negotiation impossible,
    she says.</p><p>“The only way to create an agreement is to put yourself in the
    other person’s shoes and come up with a package that might appeal to both of you,”
    Conner says. “If they are incapable of seeing the world through anyone else’s
    eyes, they won’t be able to do this. They will just remain stuck on their vision
    of what should be, convinced that everyone will see it their way.”</p><p>This
    would explain why Trump was reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/us/politics/trump-shutdown-west-wing-shake-up.html">shocked</a>
    that the Democrats did not agree to his border-wall terms. He was unable to see
    the situation from their point of view. When this kind of intransigence takes
    hold in Conner’s cases, the parties are sometimes forced to rely on judges to
    make the decision.</p><p>In Trump’s case, if he is unable to compromise before
    the government shuts down again in two weeks, the courts might have to get involved.
    Or Trump might just turn the government back on in order to be the hero. “Narcissists
    are so good at showing up as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/06/20/showbiz/music/kanye-west-god-complex-yeezus/index.html">Messiahs</a>,”
    Behary says. If he’s at risk of losing the support of his fan base, which he needs
    in order to stop the pain, he will swoop in to save the day. Because that’s what
    narcissists do.</p><p>Typically, when all else fails and narcissists are unable
    to get the attention and affirmation they need, they play the victim. If the investigations
    continue to intensify, and if Trump begins to lose the affection of his base,
    Fox News pundits, and Republican leaders, he may resign, Behary predicts, based
    on all the narcissists she has treated for decades. “He’ll point the finger and
    say, ‘I was making America great again, and the Democrats stopped me.’”</p><p>Trump
    may not behave this way. Human behavior is complicated. But isn’t it useful to
    know how other people like him tend* *to behave, generally speaking? So let’s
    stop living in the past, under the old rules of journalism and politics. Let’s
    start talking about mental health with the directness and care that our readers
    deserve. If journalists want to help the public understand the world in which
    we live, it is time to find new pundits — the kind who have seen this all before,
    who can empathize with the president and his opponents, and who do not benefit
    from perpetuating the chaos.</p>'

  :title: 3 Hobbies That Can Improve Your Memory And Maintain a Healthy Brain
  :content: '<p>A healthy lifestyle supports brain health</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2788/1*tt3GG0XKcbFNJLCWzQX4qw.png"
    alt="Illustration: [Leslie Soto Valenzuela](https://www.behance.net/lesliesotovalenzuela)"><em>Illustration:
    <a href="https://www.behance.net/lesliesotovalenzuela">Leslie Soto Valenzuela</a></em></p><p>Cognitive
    decline is inevitable as we get older.</p><p><a href="https://www.apa.org/research/action/memory-changes">According</a>
    to the American Psychological Association, “the brain’s volume peaks in the early
    20s and gradually declines for the rest of life”.</p><p>But your lifestyle can
    slow the process. You can preserve and even enhance your mental capabilities as
    you age. Simple behaviour changes can help us stay sharp for as long as possible.
    What you do or don’t do makes a huge difference to your memory skills.</p><p>Pursuing
    both intellectual and physical challenges, as uncomfortable as it may be, is one
    of the best ways to slow the natural memory decline process. New challenges are
    a way to exercise the mind and build new pathways.</p><h2>Embrace New Learning
    Styles/Formats</h2><p>Everyone learns in different ways.</p><p>You might find
    reading enormously effective, while your friend would rather watch a video or
    listen to a podcast. Each path creates differing experiences and memories.</p><blockquote><h1>Most
    people have a dominant style and tend to use that for acquiring new knowledge.
    Others use a combination of different content types— posts, talks, documentaries,
    books (digital and physical) and podcasts.</h1></blockquote><p>Research shows
    that each learning style uses different parts of the brain. By involving more
    of the brain during learning, you can improve your ability to recall information
    and remember more of what you learn.</p><p>I tend to read my books on an iPad.
    I have started reading more physical copies — I’ve ordered dozens of them to read
    in the evenings to stay away from screens every now and then. I’ve also been watching
    more educational documentaries on Netflix.</p><p>A new learning style can improve
    your brain’s processing of information over time. Develop an ability in less dominant
    learning styles and you could find something new in a completely different and
    enjoyable way.</p><h2>Cultivate a Broad Range of Artistic Interests</h2><blockquote><h1>Pablo
    Picasso once said, “Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.”</h1></blockquote><p>Taking
    up a new hobby or rediscovering an old one (drawing, painting, photography, dancing,
    making something in response to music, gardening, etc.) can help you improve your
    focus, mood and memory. Artistic hobbies stimulate the brain to grow new ones
    by using the senses in new ways.</p><p>Learning something new requires you to
    stretch yourself physically, mentally or emotionally. Any hobby that involves
    a great deal of attention to detail can stave off cognitive decline and improve
    your memory.</p><blockquote><h1>Besides relieving stress and engaging the whole
    brain, hands-on artistic pursuits are a form of “neurobics,” <a href="https://blog.soarlifeproducts.com/cognition-memory/building-great-memories-4-hobbies-actually-improve-memory-skills/">says</a>
    Dr. Lawrence Katz in his book, “Keep Your Brain Alive: 83 Neurobic Exercises to
    Prevent Memory Loss and Increase Mental Fitness.”</h1></blockquote><p>Katz says
    art builds connections between the neurons and stimulates the brain to grow new
    ones by using the senses in new ways.</p><p>So, while physical exercise, games
    and meditation have a place in protecting your brain from cognitive decline, don’t
    neglect the benefits of artistic hobbies like drawing, painting, photography or
    learning to music an instrument.</p><p>Einstein was an accomplished amateur violinist.</p><p>His
    son, Hans Albert, once said, “whenever he felt that he had come to the end of
    the road or into a difficult situation in his work, he would take refuge in music,
    and that would usually resolve all the difficulties.”</p><h2>Becoming a Lifelong
    Learner Can Help You Maintain a Healthy Brain</h2><p>A consistently stimulated
    brain may be the key to a vibrant life.</p><p>Life-long learning — the “ongoing,
    voluntary, and self-motivated” pursuit of new knowledge, can keep our brains working
    at optimum levels — which can limit cognitive and memory decline as we age.</p><p>When
    you learn something new, your brain isn’t only getting smarter – it’s getting
    stronger — new information strengthens the pathways between neurons in the brain.</p><p>Any
    time you give your brain new information, you’re helping to protect it against
    the natural deterioration that comes with aging.</p><blockquote><h1>Lifelong learning
    is the key to maintaining cognitive function,” <a href="https://easylivingfl.com/best-brain-boosting-hobby/">says</a>
    Rosebud Roberts in the Mayo Clinic’s study published in Neurology.</h1></blockquote><p>“It’s
    a ‘use it or lose it’ scenario. When you engage in cognitively stimulating activities
    you’re strengthening synaptic connections, but if you don’t use those circuits
    in your brain, the connections degenerate, she adds. Mentally stimulating learning
    in life makes a huge difference in your memory retention.</p><p>Life-long learning
    is a journey, not a destination — there’s never a shortage of new things to learn.
    Choose to learn skills, ideas and concepts you find interesting and the journey
    will be fun.</p><p>A hobby is not just a way to pass the time; it can also keep
    your brain engaged, boost your cognition and improve the quality of your life.
    Make time to pick up a few hobbies. Given what research tells us, they will keep
    your brain wonderfully healthy.</p><p><a href="https://postanly.substack.com/">*Join

    health is a frequently misunderstood topic:</p><ul><li><p>Many people believe
    that mental health is predetermined — that you are essentially at the mercy of
    your genetics and brain chemistry.</p></li><li><p>Other people believe that it’s
    simply a matter of will power — this is exemplified by the “just think positive”
    mentality.</p></li></ul><p>But the truth is in the messy middle:</p><blockquote><h1><strong>Mental
    health is not a matter of fate or a single decision—it’s mostly a matter of habits.</strong></h1></blockquote><p>In
    my work as a psychologist, the best way I’ve found to help people strengthen their
    mental health is to help them cultivate healthy habits, especially mental habits.</p><p>This
    doesn’t mean that other factors like your biology or social context don’t matter
    — they definitely do! But for most of us, the thing we have the most control over
    is the habits we choose to build and live by.</p><p>Here are four uncommon habits
    that will improve your mental health and resilience.</p><h2>1. Be curious about
    your own mind.</h2><p><em>Metacognition</em> is the ability to observe and think
    about your own mind and how it works — and it’s a key ingredient for lasting mental
    health.</p><p>Most people act on autopilot, especially when strong emotions are
    involved:</p><ul><li><p>You feel angry and <em>immediately</em> lash out — saying
    something sarcastic, slamming a door, or even just ruminating in your own mind
    about how terrible someone else is.</p></li><li><p>You feel anxious and <em>immediately</em>
    try to distract yourself with meaningless activities or you call a friend for
    reassurance.</p></li><li><p>You feel sad and <em>immediately</em> turn to alcohol
    or food to numb out the pain.</p></li></ul><p>Not only does impulsiveness lead
    to bad decisions, but it prevents us from learning something new about ourselves.</p><p>If
    you always resort to sarcasm anytime you feel angry, for example, your vision
    of what anger is and what it means is quite limited. It’s just a bad feeling that
    leads to saying cruel things.</p><p>On the other hand, if you cultivate the habit
    of observing your thoughts and feelings — especially the uncomfortable ones —
    you can begin to get curious about them.</p><p><strong>When you learn to be curious
    about your own mind, self-awareness and growth are not far behind.</strong></p><p>For
    example, if you took a minute to observe and get curious about your anger, you
    might realize that behind your anger is some fear — fear that people won’t love
    you for who you are, fear that you’ll be alone, maybe even fear of your anger
    itself. Which means that anger, and all the behaviors that come out of it, are
    merely a distraction from the real issue — your fear and insecurity.</p><p>But
    this kind of self-knowledge is only possible if you consistently pause and observe
    your own mind from a place of curiosity.</p><p>The next time you feel a strong
    emotion, hit the pause button. Then ask yourself: <em>What’s going on in my mind
    right now?</em></p><blockquote><h1><em>“Between stimulus and response, there is
    a space… In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies
    our growth and freedom.”</em></h1><h1><em>— Viktor Frankl</em></h1></blockquote><h2>2.
    Be compassionate with your suffering.</h2><p>A sure sign of mental health is that
    you are compassionate with yourself when times are hard — that you approach your
    mistakes and suffering in a gentle, rational way, without resorting to extremes.</p><p>In
    my experience as a psychologist, the one thing that unites virtually every one
    of my clients is that they lack the habit of <em>self-compassion</em>.</p><p><strong>Self-compassion
    means that in times of pain or suffering, you treat yourself like you would treat
    a good friend — in an empathetic, balanced, non-judgmental way.</strong></p><p>Ironically,
    while most of us are quite good at being compassionate with other people, we’re
    terrible at being compassionate with ourselves:</p><ul><li><p>When you make a
    mistake, you immediately start criticizing yourself with negative self-talk and
    catastrophic predictions.</p></li><li><p>When you feel upset or afraid, you immediately
    criticize yourself for being weak and discount your pain as silly or trivial.</p></li><li><p>When
    you’re uncertain or confused, you compare yourself to others — as if shame will
    motivate you to figure things out.</p></li></ul><p>In other words, your default
    response to mistakes and pain is to be hard on yourself. This is probably the
    result of a culture that insists that the only way to achieve success in life
    (and therefore happiness) is to be tough on yourself.</p><p>But I see little evidence
    that being hard on yourself improves either your success or happiness in the long
    run. If anything, people who are successful probably got their despite their lack
    of self-compassion, not because of it.</p><p>The antidote to being hard on yourself
    is self-compassion.</p><p>Importantly, <strong>self-compassion doesn’t mean that
    you’re soft or spoiled</strong>, it just means taking a balanced view of your
    mistakes and failures:</p><ul><li><p>Self-compassion means acknowledging your
    failures for what they are without dwelling on them.</p></li><li><p>Self-compassion
    means reminding yourself that you are more than the sum of your mistakes. Far
    more.</p></li><li><p>Self-compassion means acknowledging that just because you
    <em>feel</em> bad doesn’t mean you <em>are</em> bad.</p></li></ul><p><strong>There’s
    no greater strength than the ability to be gentle with yourself.</strong></p><blockquote><h1><em>“</em>The
    soft overcomes the hard.</h1><h1>The slow overcomes the fast.<em>”</em></h1><h1><em>—
    Lao-tzu</em></h1></blockquote><h2>3. Be flexible in your behavior.</h2><p>A tell-tale
    sign of poor mental health is rigid behavior. But its opposite — flexibility —
    is the key to a stronger, more healthy emotional life.</p><p>There’s an old saying
    that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and
    expecting a different result each time.</p><p>While most of us probably don’t
    fit the legal criteria for insanity, it’s probably not hard to think back on a
    time when you were suffering emotionally and see the same pattern — getting stuck
    trying the same old things to feel better but only feeling worse.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p>When
    you’re feeling depressed and down, it’s all too easy to isolate yourself and disengage
    from the world.</p></li><li><p>When you’re feeling guilty or ashamed, it’s tempting
    to replay your past mistakes over and over again in a cycle of rumination and
    self-criticism.</p></li><li><p>When you’re feeling anxious and afraid, it’s easy
    to lose yourself in a mindless distraction rather than facing up to your fears.</p></li></ul><p>In
    other words, we all tend to get stuck in habitual ways of responding to stress
    and painful emotions. We feel bad and our default behaviors kick in, often without
    much awareness.</p><p>But here’s the thing…</p><p><strong>You can’t keep doing
    the same old thing and expect new results.</strong></p><ul><li><p>If every time
    you feel anxious, you start worrying — and then find that worrying only makes
    you more anxious — maybe it’s time to think about a new way of responding to anxiety?</p></li><li><p>If
    every time you feel sad, you start ruminating — and then find that ruminating
    only makes you feel worse about yourself — maybe it’s time to think about a new
    way of responding to sadness?</p></li><li><p>If every time you feel angry, you
    criticize other people — and then find that being critical only makes you feel
    worse about yourself in the long run—maybe it’s time to think about a new way
    of responding to your anger?</p></li></ul><p>Instead of defaulting to your same
    old strategies, try to be flexible in how you respond to difficulty:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Take
    a new perspective.</strong> Ask yourself: <em>How would someone else look at this?</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Experiment
    with new behaviors.</strong> Test out what happens when you bite your tongue instead
    of lashing out or call a friend instead of isolating yourself.</p></li><li><p><strong>Study
    other people.</strong> Pay attention to how the people your admire respond to
    difficult situations and stress: <em>What do they do differently and what might
    that look like for me</em>?</p></li></ul><p>Be a scientist in your own life: observe
    what’s not working, formulate a new theory, test it out, and see how it works.</p><p><strong>You
    can think your way into almost any form of suffering, but it’s only through taking
    action that you’ll truly move on.</strong></p><blockquote><h1><em>“You cannot
    change what you are, only what you do.”</em></h1><h1><em>― Philip Pullman</em></h1></blockquote><h2>4.
    Be assertive about your values.</h2><p>The real tragedy of chronic emotional suffering
    is you become so consumed with alleviating your pain that you lose sight of the
    things that matter most — your values and aspirations.</p><p>When we feel any
    kind of pain — including emotional pain — our attention gets drawn to finding
    the quickest possible way to alleviate that pain.</p><p>For example: When your
    finger feels pain and you realize it’s resting on a hot frying pan, all your focus
    and energy go toward getting your hand off the hot pan. And for good reason —
    it would be dangerous and harmful to leave your hand on a hot stove!</p><p>But,
    while pain is often an indicator of danger, that it isn’t always. Emotional pain,
    no matter how severe, isn’t itself dangerous — no amount of sadness or anxiety,
    for example, can harm you.</p><p>But it’s easy to get confused here. It’s easy
    to treat all pain as an indication of danger. And when we do that, it means channeling
    all our attention and energy toward escaping that pain.</p><p>But there’s a cost
    to this instant pain avoidance strategy:</p><p><strong>When you spend all your
    time running away from what you <em>don’t</em> want, there’s little time left
    for running toward what you <em>do</em> want.</strong></p><p>If you suffer from
    chronic mental health issues or emotional struggles, you probably recognize this
    pattern of your life shrinking and narrowing as everything becomes about feeling
    less pain.</p><p>And while this strategy of trying to outrun your pain makes sense
    on an intuitive level, it almost never works in the long-run. And in fact, it
    often makes things worse:</p><ul><li><p>Avoiding your grief by drowning it out
    with constant distraction only perpetuates it.</p></li><li><p>Avoiding your social
    anxiety by not going out as much only intensifies it.</p></li><li><p>Avoiding
    your goals because you’re afraid of failing only makes your self-esteem issues
    worse.</p></li></ul><p>The cure to a life of chronic avoidance is assertiveness.</p><p>Crafting
    the habit of assertiveness means learning to go after what you want with confidence
    and setting boundaries on what you don’t want with strength:</p><ul><li><p>Asking
    for a nicer table at the restaurant even though you’re worried that the waiter
    might think badly of you.</p></li><li><p>Refusing to engage in hostile conversations
    with coworkers, even though it feels good to try and put them in their place.</p></li><li><p>Making
    the decision to leave your job and try a new career even though you’re scared.</p></li></ul><p>In
    the end, the only way to genuinely and consistently feel better is to starting
    moving toward the things that matter most even if you don’t feel like it.</p><p><strong>Let
    reason and values guide your decisions and trust that your feelings will follow
    in time.</strong></p><blockquote><h1><em>“If you don’t know where you are going,
    you might not get there.”</em></h1><h1><em>— Yogi Berra</em></h1></blockquote><h2>All
    you need to know</h2><p>Mental health isn’t determined by your genetics or as
    simple as thinking positive. Mental health is built and maintained through the
    cultivation of healthy, consistent habits:</p><p><strong>Be curious about your
    own mind.</strong></p><p><strong>Be compassionate with your suffering.</strong></p><p><strong>Be
    flexible in your behavior.</strong></p><p><strong>Be assertive about your values.</strong></p><p><a

  :title: Diet Research Is Deeply Flawed. Here’s What You Should Know to Eat Healthy.

    confusion around what’s good for you and what’s not</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4096/1*vJz1xVv1yPFMBw9MRn8Y9g.jpeg"
    alt="Photo: Yuhnl/EyeEm/Getty Images"><em>Photo: Yuhnl/EyeEm/Getty Images</em></p><p>It
    seems like every other week a new study comes out questioning long-held wisdom
    about food and nutrition. First fat was vilified; now it’s considered a part of
    a healthy diet. Eggs used to be off-limits for people with heart problems due
    to the high amount of cholesterol, but that’s no longer the case.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@davidludwigmd">Dr.
    David Ludwig</a> is a professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health
    and author of the number one <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <a href="https://www.drdavidludwig.com/">*Always
    Hungry?</a><em>, a book that explores the dietary drivers of hunger, obesity,
    and metabolic disease. In <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2748478">a
    new “Viewpoint” paper</a> published in August in the *Journal of the American
    Medical Association</em> (<em>JAMA</em>), Ludwig and his co-authors explain the
    problems with current approaches to dietary research and why this leads to so
    much nutrition confusion.</p><p>Here, <em>Elemental</em> asks Ludwig to elaborate
    on some of these problematic approaches and to share advice for people who feel
    conflicted about what and how to eat.</p><h3><strong>Elemental: What was the impetus
    for the JAMA viewpoint you co-authored?</strong></h3><p>*<em>Dr. David Ludwig:
    *</em>In the course of a week, almost every person will see headlines on diet
    and health that come to opposing conclusions. And we’ve seen through the years
    how what is believed to be an established fact in nutrition is later questioned
    or reversed. We wanted to address the causes of this confusion and the challenges
    facing nutrition research in comparison to other fields that have more established
    track records of assuring research quality.</p><h3><strong>You compare nutrition
    research to drug research. What do you view as the key differences?</strong></h3><p>Pharmaceutical
    research receives lots of financial support, because drugs can be highly profitable.
    A major clinical trial might cost several hundreds of millions of dollars, but
    a successful drug can earn many billions in profits. So the pharmaceutical industry
    is motivated to do these studies right — to design them properly, to make sure
    they have the strength and statistical power to get the right answers. The last
    thing a trial sponsor wants is an inconclusive result. If an experimental drug
    doesn’t work, they want to know it as quickly as possible to avoid wasting additional
    time and money. Consequently, a large infrastructure has grown in recent years
    to support pharmaceutical research, including clinical research organizations
    hired to oversee trials. These CROs have the expert staff and know-how to conduct
    rigorous trials and ensure that all scientific and regulatory standards are properly
    followed.</p><p>Compare this situation to a standard dietary trial. Researchers
    lucky enough to win a government grant from the National Institutes of Health
    (typically 10% of all applications) will have at most $500,000 a year for four
    or five years. While $2 million may sound like a lot, that’s a tiny fraction of
    the budget for a standard drug trial. More typically, nutrition research must
    make do with shoestring budgets cobbled together from small grants provided by
    universities, philanthropies, or the food industry.</p><p>Even as nutrition is
    less well-funded, it’s more complicated. Changing a person’s diet is much more
    difficult than taking a pill or a placebo, and it’s virtually impossible to do
    a double-blind study with food. Diet is personal, involving deeply entrenched
    behavior related to family, community, culture, pleasure, and even values.</p><p>To
    make matters even more challenging, changing one aspect of a diet inevitably affects
    many others as well. If you eat more of one food, you’ll probably eat less of
    another. In a study examining the effects of consuming 10 servings of vegetables
    and fruits a day, participants may naturally tend to eat less processed foods,
    because they’re less hungry. So it can be hard to tell whether any health benefits
    seen in the study are due to eating more veggies and fruits or less of the other
    stuff. At the same time, nutrition trials have difficulty determining whether
    and how diet actually changes. You can’t just measure blood levels of a drug to
    assess compliance with the protocol. The challenge of producing significant diet
    change over the long term and the inability to accurately measure these changes
    create enormous uncertainties.</p><h3><strong>Apart from funding challenges, there’s
    the question of whether the people in these diet studies are actually following
    instructions.</strong></h3><p>This is the elephant in the living room. In most
    clinical trials, people are told to follow one diet or another, and they are given
    a very modest amount of support — maybe a meeting with a dietitian once or twice
    a month. They are then expected to make this major change to their lifestyle on
    their own. This study design is especially common because of the poor funding
    and infrastructure in place for nutrition research. Inexpensive, low-intensity
    interventions are chosen by necessity. But you don’t really know if people follow
    them.</p><p>People can make changes for a few months, but without adequate support,
    they resort back to their habitual ways of eating. Because of this, we often see
    short-term weight loss in obesity trials followed by weight regain after a few
    months. These sorts of findings have been misinterpreted to mean the type of diet
    doesn’t matter. But that conclusion does not logically follow. Instead, it really
    means the intervention failed.</p><p>Imagine there’s a promising new drug that
    might cure childhood leukemia. You conduct a clinical trial with one group of
    people assigned to take the new drug and another group receiving a placebo. But
    it turns out the group assigned to the drug didn’t take it as directed. In this
    scenario, there might be no significant change in cancer treatment success. But
    we wouldn’t interpret that result to mean the drug is ineffective. We would conclude
    that the study was flawed. Unfortunately, the conduct of diet trials isn’t always
    held to this standard.</p><h3><strong>You address the importance of understanding
    biology and behavior. Is one more important than the other in diet trials?</strong></h3><p>Both
    are critical, but it’s important to keep in mind which one you want to study in
    designing a diet trial. Many people can cut back on calories and lose weight on
    any diet temporarily. But after a few days or weeks, hunger increases and their
    metabolism slows down, which is a recipe for weight regain. That’s why we need
    longer-term studies to see how the type of food we eat, beyond calories, might
    alter biology and the success of weight-loss maintenance. But the best diet in
    the world won’t work if people aren’t motivated to follow it. That’s why we also
    need studies of behavior and environment to make the challenges of lifestyle change
    easier and more sustainable.</p><h3><strong>How do we fix this problem?</strong></h3><p>Diet-related
    diseases — including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease — are the leading
    public health problems today. Whether or not you have one of these conditions,
    you’re paying for them through higher taxes, the cost of Medicare and Medicaid,
    and higher insurance rates. These costs are borne by everybody. And for people
    with a condition like Type 2 diabetes, the personal toll can be huge, including
    limb amputation, kidney failure, blindness, and shortened life expectancy. So
    it’s in everybody’s interest that research into nutrition and disease prevention
    be well funded and done properly.</p><p>Some say we can’t afford new government
    programs [to deal with this]. But today, the economic cost of Type 2 diabetes
    — just one diet-related disease — approaches $500 billion annually. The total
    medical costs and lost worker productivity of diet-related disease may already
    exceed $1 trillion annually. Without action, these figures will only increase,
    contributing to the national budget deficit and threatening the international
    competitiveness of the U.S. economy. A sort of Manhattan Project for diet-related
    disease would cost pennies on the dollar now being spent. What’s lacking is a
    clear national vision to align public health priorities with investment.</p><p>We
    know humans aren’t programmed to gain more weight generation after generation.
    Something has changed in our environment, driving even highly disciplined people
    to gain weight. We have to understand what that’s about. One likely culprit is
    all the processed carbohydrates that crept into our diet during the low-fat diet
    years. But that’s not the whole story, and many other factors are undoubtedly
    contributing. We’ll need long-term, adequately powered studies to sort this out
    once and for all.</p><p>We need to build the capacity to conduct effective nutrition
    research, and this will require sustained investment from Washington, including
    cultivation of a new generation of appropriately trained researchers at academic
    centers around the country.</p><blockquote><h1>“We know humans aren’t programmed
    to gain more weight generation after generation. Something has changed in our
    environment... We have to understand what that’s about.”</h1></blockquote><h3><strong>What
    advice can you offer the general public for reading and consuming news stories
    about nutrition research?</strong></h3><p>Ideally, medical journalists need better
    training to identify basic design flaws in clinical trials so they can convey
    a more balanced view of study strengths and limitations. We don’t want the public
    dragged back and forth with every weak new research finding. As a general rule,
    if a clinical trial on obesity has a small number of participants (fewer than
    20 people), if it’s very short term, or if it doesn’t clearly demonstrate that
    meaningful dietary changes were made, the results can be considered weak.</p><h3><strong>Are
    there certain research journals people could look to for diet studies that are
    more trustworthy?</strong></h3><p>The best studies often wind up in the best journals.
    Some top-rated journals are* JAMA<em>, *New England Journal of Medicine</em>,
    the* Lancet<em>, the</em> BMJ<em>, and *Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. <em>American
    Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> ranks at the top for the field. But there are
    many other good-quality journals that publish credible research, so a journal’s
    identity by itself is not the whole story.</p><h3><strong>Many people are confused
    about healthy eating. What’s your advice on how to eat healthy?</strong></h3><p>I
    advocate a “low glycemic load” diet — one that controls the surge in blood glucose
    and insulin after the meal. The way to achieve this is by cutting back on processed
    carbohydrates (refined grains, potato products, and sugar); increasing healthy
    fats, like nuts and nut butters, avocado, olive oil, and even dark chocolate;
    and having an adequate amount of protein, which can come from animal or plant-based
    sources. This approach involves a moderate reduction in total carbohydrates but
    still offers lots of flexibility in food choice. For people with diabetes, more
    severe restriction of carbohydrates may have additional benefits.</p><p>Not all
    researchers or clinicians, of course, will agree with this recommendation. That’s
    why we need the definitive research.</p><p>Improving the quality of nutrition
    research will be critical to public health and the international economic competitiveness
    of the U.S. in years to come. The default mode — relying on the pharmaceutical
    industry to devise ever more powerful drugs to treat diseases caused by diet —
    doesn’t make sense. It’s an ounce of prevention for a pound of cure.</p>'

    and other unhealthy outcomes.</p><p>But while suppressing your emotions is often
    bad, experts say it can sometimes lead to better outcomes.</p><p>Of course, there
    are the obvious social situations — ones many of us encounter on a daily basis
    — in which expressing your feelings would be uncomfortable or embarrassing, says
    David Caruso, a psychologist and research affiliate at the Yale Center for Emotional
    Intelligence. If you’re in a meeting with a boss or client, and they say something
    you find “utterly ridiculous,” telling them how you feel would probably do more
    harm than good, Caruso says.</p><p>But even when you’re dealing with people who
    are close to you — a family member or friend — there are situations when spilling
    your guts may exacerbate negative emotions, not assuage them.</p><p>“Emotions
    are contagious, and you can impact the emotions of others by sharing how you feel,”
    Caruso says. He points out that emotions often arise suddenly, can be fleeting,
    and are dependent on a lot of contextual factors, from how well you slept to how
    recently you’ve eaten. “How you’re feeling in the moment can be the product of
    all these unrelated things,” Caruso says. And by expressing what you’re feeling,
    not only do you pass some of your emotion to others, but you also have to deal
    with the aftermath of that disclosure.</p><p>Say that, in a fit of anger or frustration,
    you share your negative feelings with your spouse or a close friend in a way that
    makes that person feel responsible. Opening up may be satisfying in the moment,
    Caruso says, but it could also be damaging to your relationship in the long run.
    In many cases, he says, it would be better for all involved if you took some time
    alone to come to grips with the real root of your feelings.</p><blockquote><h1>“There
    are situations when spilling your guts may exacerbate negative emotions, not assuage
    them.”</h1></blockquote><p>Caruso is quick to add that “there are all sorts of
    costs associated with emotion suppression.” Along with the psychological burden
    of trying to keep your feelings to yourself, you may pay a relationship penalty.
    “When you express an emotion to someone, you’re sending them data on how you’re
    functioning, and that’s a good way to gain that person’s support,” he says.</p><p>Also,
    trying to conceal or swallow your emotions is taxing. “Our brain’s ability to
    attend to and process information is limited when we’re using cognitive resources
    to suppress or emotionally check out,” he says. (Hence the Stanford group’s finding
    that emotion suppression can be distracting.) “But when we just flail around and
    say whatever we’re feeling,” he adds, “we can get into trouble.”</p><p>Other experts
    agree. “The way we’re built, we naturally want to describe what we’re feeling
    to others, but the reality is that sometimes this would hurt other people or would
    be embarrassing to us,” says James Pennebaker, a professor of psychology at the
    University of Texas. And when you share your feelings with someone else, you risk
    them refuting or rejecting the validity of what you told them, which can be devastating.
    “In that situation, you may end up worse off than if you’d kept what you were
    feeling to yourself,” Pennebaker says.</p><p>He says a close examination of your
    emotions and an honest assessment of where they’re coming from can be more helpful
    than simply declaring what you’re feeling. “If you’re just focusing on your emotions,
    you’re often missing the point,” Pennebaker says. “The examination is the helpful
    part.”</p><p>Of course, verbalizing your feelings can help you make sense of them,
    he adds. This is why psychotherapy and other forms of talk therapy, which allow
    you to express your emotions without fear of social or personal blowback, is so
    helpful. “But my research has found that putting your emotions into words by writing
    them down can do what talking would do,” he says.</p><p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00403.x">Some
    of Pennebaker’s work</a> has shown that writing about emotional experiences can
    reduce measures of distress and depression and even improve immune function. Writing
    out how you feel, he says, seems to offer biological, mood, and cognitive benefits
    that are comparable to verbally sharing your feelings — without the risk of angering
    someone or making yourself feel silly or rejected.</p><p>“There’s no right way
    to write about your emotions,” Pennebaker says. “Just find a quiet place and do
    it for 15 minutes, three or four times a week.” He recommends thinking about what
    you’re feeling and why you’re feeling it. You can write your thoughts longhand
    or on a computer — or even with your finger in the air, he says.</p><p>Some of
    Pennebaker’s advice touches on an emotion-regulation strategy known as reappraisal.
    In simple terms, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23765157">reappraisal
    is</a> a method of identifying and reframing the underlying causes of an emotion
    in ways that may allow you to let it go. For example, if you’re feeling angry
    with your partner, recognizing that you’re hungry or stressed out — and that these
    factors, and not the thing your partner did, are the true cause of your anger
    — can help you get over your negative feelings.</p><p>And while reappraisal can
    seem a bit like emotion suppression, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2483789/">research
    suggests</a> it comes with few of the negative side effects of trying to ignore
    or hide emotions.</p><p>Opening up about your feelings can be a great way to understand
    and manage them, but a “full disclosure” approach to sharing your emotions may
    not always lead to the best outcomes.</p>'

    href="http://www.johannawalderdorff.com/">Johanna Walderdorff</a></em></p><p>If
    your doctor told you to stop taking your medication and not come back for a checkup
    so soon, you’d be confused. If she followed up by telling you that it’s okay to
    eat some chocolate and fatty foods, enjoy a glass of beer or wine, or have lots
    of coffee, you might reconsider her expertise. But in fact she would be doing
    something far too few medical professionals do: advising patients based on the
    latest available science.</p><p>Much of the health advice people receive today
    is misguided and based on old conventions rather than the latest research. We
    are led to believe that to be healthy, we must spend half our lives in doctors’
    offices, ingest a constant stream of narcotic-strength drugs, consume a spartan
    diet, drink so-called health elixirs that look like witch’s potions, and exercise
    with the intensity of an Olympic athlete and the joy of a KGB recruit. We must
    worry about the food we eat, the tests we don’t take, and the pills we don’t swallow.
    Above all, we must worry. And all that worry costs us dearly — monetarily, emotionally,
    and physically.</p><p>But over the years, mainstream medical studies at respected
    institutions have repeatedly shown that many of the foods and behaviors we’ve
    been warned to avoid all our lives may not really harm us, and when consumed or
    engaged in properly, they may actually be beneficial. The list of good vices includes
    beverages like coffee, which research suggests can lower the risk of Type 2 diabetes
    and possibly protect from Alzheimer’s disease and dementia; foods like chocolate
    and whole-milk raw cheese; lifestyle choices like sleeping late and laughing a
    lot; and downright shocking practices like going to the doctor less, taking fewer
    medications, and avoiding many prescribed but often unnecessary medical procedures.</p><p>We
    don’t necessarily understand the reasons some of these vices can be good for us.
    It’s possible the joy we get from them is partly what makes them healthy. Feeling
    happy diminishes stress and seems to supercharge the immune system, which, among
    other things, may lead to better resistance to certain illnesses. The good news
    doesn’t stop there. Studies have even shown that being happy can help you live
    longer. Ancient Greek physician Hippocrates, the father of medicine, famously
    said, “Let food be thy medicine.” Too often, contemporary medicine says to let
    worry and overprescribed drugs be thy medicine. But in our experience — as a naturopathic
    physician with nearly 40 years of experience, as well as a food and health journalist
    — we say let good friends, family, food, nature, and happiness be thy medicine.</p><blockquote><h1>We
    don’t necessarily understand the reasons some of these vices can be good for us.
    It’s possible the joy we get from them is partly what makes them healthy.</h1></blockquote><p>Though
    we celebrate good vices, by no means do we advocate wanton hedonism. Our point
    is not to encourage people to eat and drink bad foods and smoke and gain weight.
    The point is for people to be happier and healthier by being freer and following
    truth. Alas, not every vice is good for us; your parents were right about the
    wisdom of avoiding many of them. Cigarettes are as bad for you as your mother
    told you they were. A little sugar may be fine, but excessive consumption of candy
    and sweets shouldn’t be part of your daily routine, and bacon, we’re sorry to
    say, appears to be good only for your soul. And if you come across a vice with
    potential upsides that you don’t already engage in, do not start it for health
    reasons. If you don’t enjoy it, it might not provide the same health benefits
    for you that it does for other people.</p><p>We regularly tell patients that no
    matter how busy or stressed they are, they should do something that they look
    forward to each day. It could be something seemingly virtuous—a short walk with
    the dog, a quick bike ride or swim, a delicious dinner—but it could also be a
    quick game of poker or blackjack, or a single malt scotch or cold beer. What’s
    important is that it provides joy. Even if we haven’t discovered the “meaning
    of life,” when we look forward to something each day, it gives that day a little
    more meaning.</p><p>When he was over 70, the late great comedian Rodney Dangerfield
    told an audience that he had just come from his doctor, who told him that if he
    ate right, exercised, and got plenty of fresh air, he’d get old, sick, and die.</p><p>Too
    true.</p><p>Our fate is set, and as far as we know, no one avoids leaving the
    earth when the time comes. What we want to do and can do is to have fun, live
    well, enjoy ourselves, and share health and happiness the best we can, for as
    long as we can.</p><p>If we stretch our time on earth a little longer and live
    a little better, so be it. We do this not by making life more rigid, restrictive,
    and boring, but more colorful, enjoyable, and fulfilling.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*JUzZcQElxr75tjBoOUBDRQ@2x.png"

    wrong. But what if they’re right?</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*HyczWig-eCsRqbEwWRM8RQ.jpeg"

    via <a href="http://animalia-life.club/other/human-heart-art.html">Animalia Life</a>.</em></p><p>A
    friend was visiting from out of town. We’d spent the evening before drinking and
    talking, and were looking forward to a hungover breakfast at a nearby diner.</p><p>The
    week before, I’d been inundated with emails and comments from trolls. <em>You
    won’t be screaming about acceptance when you lose a foot. I hope this fat f</em>**
    knows the strain she puts on her heart when she tries to stand up. You’re damn
    right I’m fat shaming — fat people should be ashamed.*</p><p>My friend’s visit
    was a happy respite, an opportunity to commiserate and blow off steam. We sat
    down at the diner and began a conversation with the couple next to us, an outgoing
    pair, eager to talk about the sports news of the day. After a few minutes of happy
    and boisterous conversation, we each returned to our breakfasts and our respective
    conversations.</p><p>Between my friend’s remarks, pieces of our neighbors’ exchange
    lodged in my skin like shrapnel.</p><p>“She’s the heaviest she’s ever been. She
    won’t hear anything about it from anyone. She says she’s ‘hurt’ and ‘offended’
    when it comes up.” The slim woman next to me salted her eggs and sighed with knowing
    exhaustion. “I told her, just spend one year counting every single thing you eat.
    You’ll be amazed at what happens in a year. I lost ten pounds in three months.
    The weight just melts off.”</p><p>Her companion jumped in. “I could talk to her.
    I lost 15 pounds and kept it off. It’s not hard,” he offered.</p><p>“We all know
    she needs to lose 100 pounds,” she offered, her indignation turning to anger.</p><p>“At
    <em>least</em>,” he added.</p><p>“Right. Probably closer to 150. But we’re not
    allowed to talk about it.”</p><p>My skin stung with the familiarity of the conversation,
    the thin naivety of believing that fat people simply don’t know we’re fat, or
    that we haven’t been told about calorie counting, Whole 30, Keto, Atkins, Paleo,
    Slim Fast, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, Nutrisystem, South Beach. That we haven’t
    tried them all.</p><p>The deep belief that there is no difference between losing
    fifteen pounds and ten times as much. The noblesse oblige of becoming a missionary
    for thinness, spreading the Good Word. The ease with which they saw their own
    bodies as accomplishments. The readiness with which they thought of fat bodies
    as failures, pitiable attempts that fell short of their own admirable standards.
    They had mastered the piety and penitence of thinness. Fat people needed their
    salvation.</p><p>I wondered who they were talking about. Was she a daughter? A
    niece? A friend, or a coworker? Was she in denial about her size, as they thought?
    Or did she sense their naked judgment, and decide to save herself the familiar
    pain of justifying the only body she had? Maybe she simply felt exhausted by explaining
    her body to every person who felt entitled to ask. When did she first prove herself
    unqualified, in their eyes, to look after her own body? When did they decide that
    hijacking it was the best way forward?</p><p>“She insists she’s happy, but we
    all know that’s a lie.”</p><p>“I don’t care how happy she is. If she doesn’t make
    some changes, she’s going to die. And it’ll be her own damn fault.”</p><p>And
    there it was: the familiar proclamation of a fat person’s impending demise. The
    exasperation that almost turns to gloating. The ugly satisfaction of predicting
    a fat person’s death.</p><p>“I’m just concerned for her,” she sighed. “I just
    want to know she’s motivated. Is that so much to ask?”</p><p>It was.</p><p>Afterward,
    my friend and I stood outside. I told him about the conversation.</p><p>“Jesus.
    I didn’t hear any of it.” He exhaled heavily. “This was after we spoke to them?”</p><p>I
    nodded.</p><p>“Did you think it might be a performance? Like, maybe they were
    talking so you could hear. Had you thought of that?”</p><p>I hadn’t. My heart
    sunk.</p><p>In the days following, I couldn’t get their conversation out of my
    head. The heartbreak of it wasn’t their gossip or self-satisfaction. It wasn’t
    their entitlement to see fat people’s pain, regret, or motivation. It wasn’t their
    certainty that their response was <em>for her own good. *It was their eager use
    of *health</em> and <em>concern</em> to pass harsh, heartless judgments about
    someone they ostensibly loved.</p><p>Was this how thin people spoke to one another
    when fat people weren’t around? Was this how my family and friends talked about
    me? I had long suspected it was, but hadn’t heard it firsthand.</p><p>At the diner,
    I was a fly on the wall for a conversation that was predicated on my absence.
    I watched my own funeral, heard my own eulogy. It was harsh, unforgiving, exasperated.
    It was controlling, exhausted from exerting its own authority over another person’s
    body. These two had ordained themselves ministers, duty-bound to exorcise her
    fat. All in the name of <em>health</em> and <em>concern.</em></p><p>But their
    conversation didn’t have any hallmarks of concern. Concern is curious, tender,
    loving. Concern is direct and heartfelt. Concern does its work delicately, with
    great care. It looks after the people you hold dear. Concern is rooted in love.
    But their conversation was rooted in power and open contempt.</p><p>Concern for
    fat people is understandable. Every day, local and national news features stories
    about the <em>obesity epidemic</em>, punctuated by footage of fat torsos, presuming
    that showing our faces — our personhood — would cause too much shame. After all,
    who could bear to be seen in a body like ours? But concern — true concern — shows
    itself vulnerably. It does not insist upon itself, shouting out the din around
    it. Concern asks tenderly, walks softly. Concern brings the soft brushes of an
    archeological dig, not a steamroller to pave over what lies beneath. Concern does
    not flatten everything in its path.</p><p>I had been flattened. I could only imagine
    how these strangers’ absent loved one felt.</p><p>Fat people — especially very
    fat people, like me — are frequently met with screwed up faces insisting on <em>health</em>
    and <em>concern.</em> Often, we defend ourselves by insisting that concerns about
    our health are wrongheaded, rooted in faulty and broad assumptions. We rattle
    off our test results and hospital records, citing proudly that we’ve never had
    a heart attack, hypertension, diabetes. We proudly recite our gym schedules and
    the contents of our refrigerators.</p><p>Many fat people live free from the complications
    popularly associated with their bodies. Many fat people don’t have diabetes, just
    like many fat people do have loving partners, despite common depictions of us.
    Although we are not thin, we proudly report, we are happy and we are healthy.</p><p>We
    insist on our goodness by relying on our health. But what we mean is that we are
    tired of automatically being seen as sick. We are exhausted from the work of carrying
    bodies that can only be seen as doomed. We are tired of being heralded as *dead
    men walking, *undead specters from someone else’s morality tale.</p><p>Those defensive
    assertions about our health aren’t wrong, but they don’t reflect every fat person’s
    reality. Some of us aren’t healthy or able-bodied. Some of us struggle with chronic
    illness, mental health issues, eating disorders, disabilities, abuse. Some of
    us have hypertension, diabetes, heart disease. For those fat people, <em>happy
    and healthy</em> is an alienating aspiration, and an unreliable narrator of our
    bodies.</p><p><strong>Fat people’s humanity cannot rest on our happiness or health
    any more than it can rely on our size. Whoever we are, however our bodies came
    to be, <em>health</em> will not deliver us from the well-intentioned bullying
    of *concern.</strong>*</p><p>Our delivery from *concern *lies only with you, the
    stranger who asks about diabetes, or the acquaintance who recommends bariatric
    surgeons. You, the family member who believes we will never find a partner because
    who could love a body like ours? You, the coworker who offers diet advice that’s
    never been requested. You, the friends who complain over breakfast about a friend’s
    size.</p><p>Your assumptions about fat people’s health might be wrong. Your fat
    coworker might deadlift every day after work, or be a competitive swimmer. She
    might agonize over every calorie she eats, as she’s been taught to do. Your fat
    family member might buy all of his produce at the farmer’s market, restricting
    his meals to lean proteins and local vegetables. He might be a model of <em>calories
    in, calories out.</em></p><p>Your assumptions about your fat friend’s health could
    be fundamentally wrong. But what if they’re right?</p><p>What if your fat friend
    really is sick, and has heard so much moralizing about <em>concern</em> and <em>health</em>
    that they’re afraid to tell you? What if your nightmares for the health of your
    fat loved ones are coming true for them? What if your insistence on their failings
    just reminds them of their sickness, and how no one else can understand it, much
    less forgive it?</p><p>Would you respond differently if you knew your fat friend
    were up against the immediacy of a new diagnosis, or the deep fear of a major
    surgery?Would you step into his skin, feel his swiftly beating heart and shallow
    breath, hallmarks of an insurmountable anxiety? Would you feel the way her stomach
    sunk as she realized how many people would blame her for her own demise, and how
    isolated she would truly be in such a deeply frightening situation?</p><p>In the
    face of sickness, real sickness and pain, would you still appoint yourself a grim
    reaper, or an expert sent to save your fat friend from her own body? Or would
    you find a way to love her, to care for her in an unimaginably difficult moment?</p><p>We
    don’t often ask ourselves what our response to fatness says about us, but it says
    so much about our empathy and our character. We spend so much time examining fat
    bodies in front of us that we fail to examine our response to them. We learn not
    to feel the heat and pressure that so many fat people face, and in so doing, we
    ignore our contributions to it. We can’t understand how our actions undercut our
    love for the fat people in our lives.</p><p>No, we don’t often ask those questions.
    Instead, we push away examinations of ourselves in favor of <em>health *and *concern.
    *Instead, we avoid saying *fat</em>. Instead, we defend those who hurt the people
    we love, insisting on their steamroller <em>concern</em>. Instead, we push aside
    the hard work of empathy and opt for the ease and satisfaction of judgment. Instead,
    we take comfort in thinness, believing it to be a sign of mastery and will.</p><p>Instead,
    we walk away from the bigger question: in sickness and health, who do you want
    to be?</p><p>Instead of looking at yourself, you look at me.</p>'

    alt="Photo: KATERYNA KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/Getty Images"><em>Photo: KATERYNA
    KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/Getty Images</em></p><p>Could human lives be extended
    by slowing down our hearts? Triggered by the observation that mammals with a higher
    heart rate live shorter than those with a slower one, this is the question that
    Dr. Herbert J. Levine, an eminent cardiologist and professor emeritus at Tufts
    University School of Medicine, asked in his 1997 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9316546">article</a>
    “Rest Heart Rate and Life Expectancy.”</p><p>To this day, his question has not
    been fully answered. But several recent studies have found important links between
    slower hearts and longer lives, elevating resting heart rate to the level of an
    important health indicator.</p><p>With the increasing popularity of smartwatches
    and other tracking devices, people are more aware than ever of their own resting
    heart rates, a measure defined by the number of heartbeats per minute while at
    rest, like when you’re sitting or lying down, no sooner than two hours after exercising.
    But how exactly to interpret that number, and what to do with that information,
    might not be so clear.</p><p>To complicate things further, resting heart rates
    can widely vary from person to person, as much as 70 beats per minute, according
    to a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227709">new
    study</a> that looked at the largest dataset of daily resting heart rates ever
    collected.</p><h2><strong>What is known</strong></h2><p>The most established fact
    about resting heart rate is that it’s inversely associated with a person’s level
    of physical fitness. In other words: The fitter you are, the lower your resting
    heart rate (elite athletes, for example, tend to have notoriously low heart rates).
    This happens because, as you exercise, your heart muscle becomes stronger and
    requires fewer heartbeats to pump blood.</p><p>When trying to figure out the reason
    why people with lower resting heart rates seem to live longer, researchers assumed
    that there wasn’t a direct, causal association. The main assumption among scientists
    was that people with a slower heartbeat just happened to be fitter and physical
    fitness is what made them live longer.</p><blockquote><h1>“In general, when we
    talk about resting heart rate, there is pretty good evidence that lower is better.”</h1></blockquote><p>That
    assumption was put to test by a study led by Dr. Magnus T. Jensen, head of the
    department of cardiology at the Copenhagen University Hospital Amager &amp; Hvidovre.
    His team analyzed <a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/99/12/882.full?sid=90e3623c-1250-4b94-928c-0a8f95c5b36b">data</a>
    from almost 2,800 middle-aged men followed for 16 years in Copenhagen. “Every
    individual had had an assessment of VO2 max, which is a measure of fitness level,”
    Jensen says. That data allowed them to conclude that there was in fact a direct
    association, independent of physical fitness, between having a lower heart rate
    and a lower risk of mortality.</p><p>“In general, when we talk about resting heart
    rate, there is pretty good evidence that lower is better,” says Barry A. Franklin,
    PhD, director of preventive cardiology &amp; cardiac rehabilitation at Beaumont
    Health.</p><p>So what’s considered a “normal” range for a resting heart rate?</p><p>According
    to the American Heart Association, a normal resting heart rate ranges from <a
    href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/the-facts-about-high-blood-pressure/all-about-heart-rate-pulse">60–100
    beats per minute</a>. Most experts agree with that statement, although it is not
    an absolute consensus, particularly on the higher end. “I respectfully disagree
    with calling 95 or 100 beats per minute normal,” Franklin says, adding that this
    range might already be linked to a lower life expectancy.</p><p>This week’s comprehensive
    Scripps Research study published in <em>PLOS</em>, showed that what is considered
    “normal” for one person may be abnormal for another. Individuals’ average resting
    heart rates were found to be as low as 40 and as high as 110 beats per minute.
    The researchers took data from wearable devices worn by more than 92,000 people
    over a median of 320 days.</p><p>The study also highlighted that an individual’s
    resting heart rate is pretty much consistent over time, and so deviations from
    the typical rate could be an important sign that something is wrong. “The variability
    of the resting heart rate may provide additional information, not only for cardiovascular
    health but also for pulmonary status, infectious disease detection, reproductive
    health, and possibly more,” says Giorgio Quer, first author of the study.</p><p>One
    of the limitations of the research is that it only tracked the participant’s “normal”
    heart rate, without looking at their actual health. We do not have information
    on the health condition of the individuals, so we cannot say that “normal” also
    means healthy, says Quer.</p><h2><strong>When and how to control your resting
    heart rate</strong></h2><p>There are things you can do to slow it down to a healthier
    rate. One of the most important is exercising regularly. “Even a brisk walking
    program can lower the resting heart rate in 10–12 beats per minute,” says Franklin.</p><blockquote><h1>If
    your resting heart rate is consistently above 100 beats per minute, with or without
    symptoms, you should be evaluated by a doctor.</h1></blockquote><p>While there
    are drugs, such as beta-blockers, that can lower your resting heart rate, healthy
    people with a high resting heart rate but no actual symptoms such as shortness
    of breath or chest pain, shouldn’t take them unless advised by their health care
    provider. “We don’t know if intervening on heart rate with a drug would prolong
    these people’s lives. But we do have an astounding amount of information to prove
    that lifestyle interventions — weight loss, increasing fitness, lowering blood
    pressure — are associated with both a lower heart rate and longevity,” Jensen
    says.</p><p>If your resting heart rate is consistently above 100 beats per minute,
    with or without symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness,
    you should be evaluated by a doctor, said Dr. Matthew Martinez, chair of the American
    College of Cardiology’s sports and exercise cardiology section.</p><p>You should
    also pay attention to sudden changes. “Your heart rate will vary during a day,
    after caffeine ingestion, a stressful moment, and even from walking down the hallway,”
    says Martinez. “But rapid changes — of more than 20 beats per minute within a
    minute at rest — should be brought to the attention of a health care provider.”</p><p>Although
    having a lower heart rate is generally considered a good thing, there are a few
    exceptions, Martinez notes. If you are neither an athlete nor a regular exerciser,
    and your heart is beating under 60 beats per minute (a condition called bradycardia),
    that may be a sign of specific medical conditions such as thyroid disease or a
    problem caused by abnormalities in the electrical conduction system, especially
    if symptoms such as dizziness and lightheadedness are present.</p><h2><strong>The
    pros and cons of heart rate trackers</strong></h2><p>Experts find it positive
    that people are more familiar with their heart rates. “It means that people are
    getting more engaged in their health,” says Seth S. Martin, director of the advanced
    lipid disorders program of the Ciccarone Center, Johns Hopkins Medicine. “By being
    better informed and taking a more active role in their health, they can prevent
    downstream problems.”</p><p>Tracking your heart rate could also be useful for
    detecting certain heart rhythm disorders such as atrial fibrillation, which can
    be asymptomatic, according to Dr. Nino Isakadze, a clinical cardiology fellow
    at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. A recent study funded by Apple, the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1901183">Apple
    Heart Study</a>, concluded that an Apple Watch app was able to identify atrial
    fibrillation with an 84% accuracy.</p><p>But it’s important not to get overly
    focused on the tracking. “There is a risk of information overload,” says Martinez.
    “I often advise patients about the anxiety that comes with that information and
    how to handle that data. It is an important indicator, but a fixation on the actual
    number is sometimes harmful too.” He advises his patients to check their resting
    heart rate no more than three or four times a week, always choosing different
    times of the day and no sooner than two hours after exercise and one hour after
    caffeine intake. Many tracking devices, such as the Apple Watch, show the average
    daily resting heart rate, which provides a more reliable picture of the speed
    of your heartbeat than checking it at any given moment of the day.</p><p>“There
    is certainly a risk that tracking heart rate can create anxiety which can sometimes
    lead to elevated heart rate and unnecessary doctor visits and testing,” said Isakadze.</p><p>Interpreting
    the data can also be challenging. “There are lots of reasons why your heart rate
    can be abnormal, either high or low. Devices can identify abnormalities, but accuracy
    and utility are still yet to be determined. Identifying all this information without
    understanding what to do with the data can be potentially harmful,” Martinez said.</p><p>Jensen
    shared an anecdote of how people could use that information productively in their
    daily lives. When he asked his Uber driver in London if he was enjoying the heart
    rate feature of his Apple Watch, the man told him he had noticed an increase in
    his beats per minute after starting his own business and going through a high
    level of stress. That made him think about his well-being and lead him to take
    a few days off.</p><p>If it is true that “God has given each of us just so many
    heartbeats,” as the late Dr. Levine was fond of <a href="https://now.tufts.edu/articles/old-school-doc">saying</a>,
    then the slower we play them out, the longer we may live.</p>'

  :title: On your concern for your fat friend’s health.
  :content: '<p>Art from here.</p><p>I hear the familiar hesitation in your voice
    when we speak. The sharp intake of breath, and the disappointing sigh of an unposed
    question, like the hiss of an emptying balloon. With coaxing and reassuring, you
    come out with a familiar question.</p><p><em>But what about your health? Am I
    not even supposed to care?</em></p><p>And with that, you step into a long and
    living history. It stings and disappoints, as it always does. As a fat person,
    someone is always telling me about their concern for my health, and hearing it
    from such a dear friend smarts. I need you to know about your companions — the
    friends, family, colleagues and strangers who have expressed those same concerns
    for as long as I have been fat.</p><p>I was 18 years old the first time someone
    told me I was going to die.</p><p>I had just gotten the first job that I’d been
    truly passionate about, working with poets and novelists whose writing I so admired,
    and had relied on in my adolescence. Luminaries whose work reached its warm hands
    into my ribcage, cradling everything vital and tender there, at a time that felt
    so isolating. A favorite poet was holding a reading, and I was in charge of it.</p><p>I’d
    spent months planning that first event and I couldn’t have been prouder. Dozens
    of people showed up, and everything was going according to plan. I stationed myself
    behind the food, dishing up plates for attendees and welcoming them as they made
    their way through the line. An older man, well dressed, smiled as he accepted
    the plate I handed him.</p><p>“When did you put on all that weight, sweetie?”
    he asked me. “Was it when your dad left?” I felt my face flush, and held my mouth
    stubbornly, clumsily shut. “You don’t have to die just to spite him. And you <em>are</em>
    going to die.”</p><p>My coworker stood next to me, her face a wrench of horror,
    shock, paralysis. Neither of us could muster any response, just slack faces and
    eyes welling with angry tears. We talked about it for hours afterward. <em>Did
    he just decide today was his day to be the grim reaper? Who goes around telling
    strangers they’re going to die?</em> She couldn’t shake it. Neither could I.</p><p>For
    her, that stranger was a grim and gruesome anomaly. But for me, he was more rule
    than exception. His remark, while sensational, was a familiar interruption, an
    abrupt reminder of just how insurmountable my fat body was for those around me.
    Family, friends, classmates and colleagues had long since cast me as a specter,
    frequently reminding me of my death, always couched in <em>concern</em>.</p><p>This
    was not the first time I’d been shaken by someone else’s perception of my body.
    In high school, I’d lived the life of so many fat kids before me, eventually coming
    to the hard-fought conclusion that the only solution was to retreat, weather the
    storm, and wait for high school to end. My passion had been theater, but while
    I auditioned for school plays, I was rarely cast. <em>The role was for a fiancé,
    *explained the lead in the school play. *No offense, but who’s going to fall for
    a big girl? Guys want someone who’s healthy.</em> At my next audition, the hot
    stage lights on my skin felt redundant — my body always seemed to be floodlit
    anyway. I felt like my own shadow, larger than life, unwieldy, the distorted silhouette
    of a real person.</p><p>Teachers expressed concern. One day, I’d brought a salad
    for lunch. In the cafeteria, one teacher suggested that I scrape the croutons
    off to the side. “The carbs can’t be helping,” she said, her voice high pitched
    and apologetic, her face a familiar mask of studied, sympathetic pain. I felt
    the salad turn slimy and sad in my mouth, limp greens coating my tongue. I dropped
    the remainder in the trash, and forwent lunch for the next several days.</p><p>So
    I got a part-time job, using the money to hire a personal trainer. He was fantastic:
    the kind of musclebound man I had learned to fear, but with an openness and kindness
    that consistently caught me off guard. When I first visited him, he asked me what
    my goals were. I said I wanted to stop being unhealthy. “What do you do that’s
    unhealthy?” he asked. “I’m big,” I said. He furrowed his brow, then reframed:
    “your goals could be that you want to be able to go hiking with a friend, or you
    want to run a half-marathon, or you want to be strong enough to pick up your little
    sister. It doesn’t have to be about your weight.”</p><p>I wanted to cry. He had
    seemed so nice, but he didn’t understand. He hadn’t been to the fat camp I’d been
    sent to as a child. He hadn’t seen the sidelong glances as I walked through the
    city, and the echoes of laughter I could never be sure weren’t about me. It <em>did</em>
    have to be about my weight.</p><p>I relented, remembering the work and savings
    that had gotten me there. My goal was to build endurance, so that I could run
    the mile at school without coming in last. And, over months’ worth of work, I
    achieved that goal, and I set another. And another. And another. I kept meeting
    goals, kept getting stronger and healthier. I lost a little bit of weight, but
    I was still fat. And because I was still fat, anyone at any time could decide
    to express <em>concern,</em> a reminder of just how clearly I was failing to meet
    my deepest need: having a different body.</p><p>I launched a new strategy — one
    that I used for years, well into college. I illustrated all the ways I was trying
    to lose weight: writing blog posts about all the meals I was cooking and how healthy
    they were. Opening each conversation with some anecdote that had happened at the
    gym that week.</p><p>Invariably, someone would chime in with a diet suggestion.
    <em>Have you tried *or *Did you know *or *It worked for my sister</em> or <em>Oprah
    says. *It didn’t matter what I said or did. There always seemed to be someone
    ready to offer unsolicited advice. It was a crashing, atonal symphony, discordant
    notes all insistent on their own direction. I kept searching for a melody that
    never came. When I would ask, once in a great while, for a moment of silence,
    I’d see that mask again — the grimace that everyone learns to use with fat people
    — *I’m just concerned for your health.</em></p><p>I had played a game I couldn’t
    win — as long as I was fat, I would always be seen as unhealthy. All of the trying,
    all of the successes, all of the little affirmations and crushing defeats — the
    only part of me that could be seen was the failure. In a fat body, I would always
    be worthy of blame.</p><p>And so, again, I withdrew. I stopped going shopping
    with friends to save myself from the countless sidelong glances from salespeople
    in a straight size store. I stopped going out. I stopped dating, or even talking
    about crushes.</p><p>All of these things, I learned, were for the thin. Dating,
    travel, love, sex, achievement and happiness weren’t for me. They were, the world
    insisted, rewards for the willpower I had, but which my body stubbornly refused
    to manifest. I kept exercising, kept trying new approaches to eating — tallying
    calories and carbs and points. None of them delivered the promised body, the beauty
    standard that was supposed to be so readily won with some effort. My life could
    only begin when I obtained the body that wouldn’t come.</p><p>All the while, family,
    friends, colleagues, classmates and perfect strangers returned to that furrowed
    brow and sing-song voice of concern, giving gift certificates for gyms, ordering
    for me at restaurants, sharing before &amp; after pictures of bariatric surgeries.
    <em>I just want you to be healthy.</em></p><p>The metrics of my health were strong
    — blood pressure fine, cholesterol normal, blood tests clean — but no one ever
    asked about that. The one measure that could be trusted — the shape of my skin
    — answered those unposed questions, and any claims I might make to the contrary
    were suspect at best. My friends and family metamorphosed when we talked about
    my fat body. All of their trust and love transformed into irritation, anger, and
    patronizing concern. Our rapport fell away. I could be trusted with their highs
    and lows, their professional successes and their relationship problems, but not,
    it seemed, with my experience of my own body.</p><p>There was no illustration
    of effort, no gesture sufficient, no health record convincing enough to stop the
    constant remarks and suggestions. Because most of us learn a script to recite
    when we see bodies like mine. <em>I just want you to be happy. I’m concerned about
    your health. It’s probably sugar. It’s probably carbs. It’s probably your workout.
    It’s probably you.</em></p><p>Over time, I’ve come to understand why. Nearly every
    conversation about fatness is a conversation about weight loss — one that considers
    all of us part of the same precarious circumstance. According to those anxiety-soaked
    conversations, we’re all perpetually teetering on the edge of becoming fat. Keeping
    fat at bay is like a foreign threat that’s turned internal, a Red Scare in our
    own bodies. One false move, one indulgent meal, one day without vigilant terror
    could lead any one of us to become fat.</p><p>And <em>fat *means more than just
    the size or shape of your body. In those panic-driven conversations, *fat</em>
    means you’re not trying. It means you’re not loved, because <em>fat *isn’t lovable.
    *Fat *means you’re not strong, not moral, not smart enough to stay alert to the
    threat of *fat. Fat</em> means you’ve failed.</p><p>When others see my body, it
    reminds them of all of that. I’m a manifestation of that cultural nightmare, the
    worst case scenario for their bodies to become. *If you see something, say something.
    *And when others see me, they do. Because if they’re explaining diet advice and
    mortality rates to a fat person, no one could mistake them for one.</p><p>People
    will say things to fat people that are heartless, thoughtless. They would not
    say them to anyone else, and they are not saying them to anyone else. Every warning
    shot we fire about fatness is aimed at ourselves. It is always a flagellation,
    a punishment for perceived failings, past or future, real or feared.</p><p>In
    that way, <em>concern</em> hurts all of us. For those who aren’t fat, it continues
    to feed that anxiety around becoming fat, the unthinkable possibility that always
    surrounds them. And it hurts our relationships. All of a sudden, all of our familiarity,
    friendliness and warmth fell away, replaced by prescriptive, cold and sometimes
    condescending exchanges.</p><p>It hurts me as a fat person because of the message
    it sends. Well-intentioned advice, day after day, week after week, year after
    year, shows me that I am seen first — and sometimes only — as a fat person. It
    is a tidal wave of reminders that I am, despite everything else, failing the one
    measure that matters. No matter how hard I try, how much money I spend or how
    many calories I ration, no matter how strong my mettle, it doesn’t matter. It
    can’t be seen. I don’t have the luxury of an uninterrupted day. Every day someone
    finds a way to show judgment, disdain or concern for the maligned vessel that
    carries me through the world.</p><p>Fat people learn quickly and deeply that our
    bodies are not our own. They are public property, to be commented on, judged,
    prodded, rejected. Others are always entitled to our bodies, and they are never
    our own.</p><p>As an adult, I have eked out practices to reclaim my body, just
    for a moment. I call myself fat. I make jokes about the way I’m perceived. I wear
    bright colors and fitted clothing. I have found my own peace of mind; set aside
    that long line of comments to right an eternally haunted relationship to dieting
    and food; exercised because it makes me happy and makes me feel good. All of that
    amongst those grimacing masks of concern, a Greek chorus foretelling my tragic
    death. <em>Was it when your dad left? You are going to die.</em></p><p>You asked
    if you should care about my health. Of course you should. I would want you to
    care if I fell ill, or if I were struggling with a health condition. But I’m not.
    And looking at me won’t tell you how strong I’ve become, the contents of my doctor’s
    files, the oceans of blood that my sturdy heart pumps through me. My dress size
    isn’t my medical chart. My body — all of our bodies — are too complex and wonderful
    to be reduced to that.</p><p>I am still fat. I live in the body that I have. I
    take care of it, and it reciprocates. I take small measures to tend to my own
    health and take the reins of my own happiness. The Greek chorus is still there,
    repeating <em>glorifying obesity *and *glamorizing an unhealthy lifestyle.</em></p><p>What
    I need from you, dear friend, is to buck that trend. In my life as a fat girl,
    now a fat woman, I have heard every form of concern, prescriptive, tough love
    and lecture. I have become an reluctant expert in weight loss techniques, some
    learned in desperation, others learned by force. I promise, I know.</p><p>What
    I need from you is your friendship. I know what that looks like; what it feels
    like. It is not pitying, not lecturing, not repeating refrains or insisting on
    approaches that I have asked you to abandon. Your friendship is a warm and glowing
    thing, living and responsive, reciprocal and heartfelt. It is not sing-song concern,
    not a stale script with a wooden delivery.</p><p>What I need from you is a respite
    from that relentless chorus. Take off your mask, put down your script. Sit with
    me, friend to friend, eye to eye. Let’s talk.</p><blockquote><h1>Like this piece?

    is greater than my own well-being. My sense of accountability comes from the fact
    that I feel that I owe it to them.</p><p>I tried to do the same thing with my
    health. “What’s the matter with me?” was something I thought a lot back then.
    If I don’t fix this, I’m going to die. <strong>I’m going to lose.</strong></p><p>All
    the terrible things that could happen were by-products of the process I was living.
    As a practitioner, I needed to find accountability in the trenches of that world.
    I was accountable to my employees in business. I needed to find someone who could
    hold me to those standards in health as well. I needed the same drive that I had
    in business.</p><p>So, what happened? How did I make the switch?</p><p>I introduced
    a person to hold me accountable. I hired a full time trainer. <a href="http://www.ontheregimen.com/">Mike</a>.
    The reason I work out every day is because I don’t want to let Mike down. I have
    to be ready to go at 5:45am because Mike will be upset if I’m not.</p><p>I hacked
    away at what made me tick till I discovered, within myself, what would force me
    to get healthy.</p><p>So that worked for me. I succeeded at finding a way for
    myself to make it work.</p><p>But so often these narratives can be frustrating
    because they leave us with tactics and hacks and ideas…and that’s it. And you’ve
    probably read a bunch of articles on the best stretches, the best fifteen minute
    workouts, the best smoothies.</p><p>The thing is, there is something we aren’t
    addressing enough in this space.</p><p>Here is the real lesson in my narrative
    that applies to everyone: <strong>it’s all about religion, not tactics</strong>.</p><p>It’s
    not about P90X, or CrossFit, or a juice cleanse. It’s about an enormous mental
    shift. It’s about believing in what you do.</p><p>That’s what happened to me.
    Before I even decided what kind of routine I was going to get myself into, I took
    a big step back and self-evaluated. I asked myself questions and tried to become
    as self-aware as possible. I realized my whole accountability thing. I made a
    switch. I refocused.</p><p>The tactic was accountability. But it became a religion
    over the first sixteen months, when I changed my entire thinking.</p><p>I figured
    out exactly what I needed by being brutally honest with myself: I needed someone
    to babysit me. Now all I ask is that you’re equally honest with yourself when
    you answer: What will it really take for you to make the change?</p><p>For some,
    money still may be the bottleneck. To that I say this: Nothing is more important
    than your health. So before you buy that next 42-inch TV, go on an extra vacation,
    or buy season tickets to your favorite sports team, it might be worth taking a
    step back and seeing how you can make a strong financial commitment to your health.
    I am the extreme. It’s not practical for everybody to go out and hire a personal
    trainer, but gym memberships are becoming more affordable, fresh produce is attainable,
    and YouTube has hundreds of free workouts.</p><p>Starting now could mean 20 extra
    years of doing what you love. Isn’t that reason enough? Definitely was for me.</p><p><em>Would
    love to hear your thoughts on all of this. Leave a response below, or shoot me
    a message.</em></p>'

    Stock “Organic Food” photo. Apparently, if it comes in a basket, it’s organic</em></p><p>An
    ongoing argument that I’ve had with almost every “clean eater” that I’ve ever
    met is about organic food. Virtually every person who tries to eat healthy, at
    one point or another, decides to go organic. It’s better for the environment,
    and getting rid of all those nasty chemicals *has *to be good for your health.</p><p>Right?</p><p><img

    Average farm worker, probably"><em>Pictured: Average farm worker, probably</em></p><p>You
    see this everywhere. The first thing that every paleo proponent will earnestly
    tell you is that conventional farming causes everything from <a href="http://paleo.com.au/clean-15-dirty-dozen-updated-list/">cancer
    to autoimmune disease</a>, and pretty much everything in between. A quick glance
    online shows you people demonizing GMOs and pesticides left right and centre,
    with organics apparently the only safe choice in a sea of disease-causing nasties.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*tcWZKJ0Fasli3K0UpPb5SA.png" alt="Pictured:
    Wrong"><em>Pictured: Wrong</em></p><p>But alarmist fearmongering about nasty chemicals
    is all the rage, and despite these claims we all seem to be getting <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/life_tables/en/">stubbornly
    healthier</a> every year.</p><p>So what does the evidence say about organic food?</p><h3>What
    Is Organic?</h3><p>The first thing to iron out is what organic food actually is.
    This is not such an easy question to answer, surprisingly. Not only does it differ
    from country to country, but the regulation and monitoring of organics can be
    <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-19/greenwashing-fears-prompts-push-for-tough-organic-labelling-laws/8450452">so
    bad</a> that in some places it’s hard to see any difference between conventional
    farming and organics at all.</p><p>However, a pretty useful definition can be
    found on the website “<a href="http://www.healthy-holistic-living.com/definition-of-organic-food.html">Healthy
    Holistic Living</a>”, because it provides a window into the complete nonsense
    that makes up the health claims for organic foods:</p><blockquote><p>“ Organic
    foods are produced according to certain production standards. For crops, it means
    they were grown without the use of conventional pesticides, artificial fertilizers,
    human waste, or sewage sludge and that they were processed without ionizing radiation
    or food additives. For animals, it means they were reared without the routine
    use of antibiotics and without the use of growth hormones. In most countries,
    organic produce must not be genetically modified”</p></blockquote><p>Basically,
    the idea is that organic food should be farmed like we did in medieval times:
    no ‘artificial’ chemicals, no raw sewage, and animals that are at constant risk
    of nasty infection and death.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*IuxhJ-oBoodlD4XWn7IHrw.jpeg"
    alt="Pictured: Organic. Yum!"><em>Pictured: Organic. Yum!</em></p><p>There are
    obvious issues with this. No farmer puts raw sewage on their crops, because that
    kills them. Banning artificial fertilizers and conventional pesticides means that
    actually you can use fertilizers and pesticides as long as they are natural and/or
    unconventional. Processing using ionizing radiation is both a) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_irradiation">safe</a>
    and b) kills nasty things like viruses and bacteria <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_irradiation">in
    your food</a>.</p><p>I could go on. Actually, I will.</p><p>Genetic modification
    is neither a problem for human health nor actually forbidden in organic farming:
    the only thing that’s forbidden is genetic modification *in a lab. *Humans have
    been genetically modifying food for centuries through a practice known as hybridization,
    which is basically breeding plants to have the desired qualities. It’s how we
    eliminated seeds from the banana, for example.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*Ao94MKThAliwMHKVlR-n5A.jpeg"
    alt="Wheat was one of the first hybridized grain crops, increasing yields by [hundreds
    of times](http://www.nma.gov.au/online_features/defining_moments/featured/federation-wheat)"><em>Wheat
    was one of the first hybridized grain crops, increasing yields by <a href="http://www.nma.gov.au/online_features/defining_moments/featured/federation-wheat">hundreds
    of times</a></em></p><p>Overall, it sounds as if the major factors of organic
    farming — pesticide use, non-GMO etc — might not have the health impact that so
    many people say organics provide.</p><h3>The Evidence</h3><p>Whether organics
    are good for your health has been the subject of a lot of research. From tiny
    studies looking at animals and cells in a lab, to large, well-controlled human
    interventional studies, we’ve looked into the question quite a bit.</p><p>There
    have been a number of systematic reviews looking at the potential health benefits
    of organics. Systematic reviews are studies where scientists look at the entire
    body of literature, searching through hundreds of thousands of studies, to see
    what the evidence for and against a position is.</p><p>And if we look at the systematic
    reviews on organic food, we find the same answer time and again: organic food
    offers <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/92/1/203.short">no</a> <a href="http://imsear.li.mahidol.ac.th/bitstream/123456789/135469/1/ijmr2010v131n4p478.pdf">health</a>
    <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/90/3/680.short">benefits</a> <a href="http://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/1355685/organic-foods-safer-healthier-than-conventional-alternatives-systematic-review">whatsoever</a>
    when compared to conventionally-farmed food.</p><p>None.</p><p>Organic food is
    no healthier for you than anything else.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*GMQe863f32rdOOr1wiwGJg.jpeg"
    alt="Remember, if it doesn’t come in a basket it’s probably not really organic
    anyway"><em>Remember, if it doesn’t come in a basket it’s probably not really
    organic anyway</em></p><p>This is no surprise. As I mentioned, the things organic
    food protects against may sound terrifying, but actually turn out not to be bad
    for you at all. Yes, pesticides can be dangerous if you chug down bottles of them,
    but the amount you get in the average tomato is in the order of *nanograms. *For
    reference, you have more formaldehyde in your body right now than pesticides.</p><p>Not
    so scary after all when you look at it that way, is it?</p><h3>Bottom Line</h3><p>Organic
    food is popular for a number of reasons. There’s certainly evidence that it is
    <a href="https://theconversation.com/organic-farming-matters-just-not-in-the-way-you-think-74124">better
    for the environment</a> than conventional options, and if you want to spend a
    little extra to make an impact protecting biodiversity then I say good for you.</p><p>But
    the fear of conventional farming is simply irrational. There is good evidence
    that pesticides in the amounts that you’ll find in most supermarket food has <a
    href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/8/5/1402/htm">no impact on human health whatsoever</a>.
    Conventional farming has revolutionized the world by allowing easy access to fresh
    food all year round — if anything, conventional farming has been responsible for
    saving many millions of lives worldwide.</p><p>The promotion of organic food is
    yet another example of the naturalistic fallacy: that things are healthy because
    they are natural. This is boring nonsense, as anyone who has been bitten by a
    natural viper or had natural tapeworms could tell you. Organic food is just another
    way for con artists to sell health because people are afraid of what they don’t
    understand.</p><p>Ultimately, there is one good reason to eat organic: the environment.</p><p>That’s
    it.</p><p>The evidence shows that organics are no better for your health at all.</p><p><em>If

    engineering is one field where experiences can vary. Some relish programming while
    others can find it frustrating. Building software can stress anyone out, no doubt
    about that.</p><p>In order to avoid that, here’s a list of honest slogans depicting
    some of the popular programming languages — with no intention of offending anyone.
    Humor helps build connections and I hope some of these would make you chuckle.</p><h2>Java</h2><p>We’re
    getting old and were always verbose. But pay us and we’ll give you long term support.</p><h2>C</h2><p>I
    might be the oldest, but you still have to allocate me space. Pointing at others
    is my favorite hobby.</p><h2>C++</h2><p>You can hate us, despise us, but we’ll
    find our ways into your framework. We believe in friends at work.</p><h2>C</h2><p>I’m
    neither like my father nor a music note. I’d see sharper than Java, only if there
    was cross-platform GUI support.</p><h2>Lua</h2><p>Beginners love us because array
    indexing starts at 1. But arrays aren’t arrays and objects aren’t objects as we
    view everything as tables.</p><h2>JavaScript</h2><p>We promise, this isn’t a script
    for Java or derived from it. By the way, Apple’s Safari engine still calls us
    back.</p><h2>Python</h2><p>We’ve made it possible to write pseudo-code in real
    even if you don’t understand it. Not a semicolon or a bracket but extra whitespace
    is all it takes to cause chaos.</p><h2>Go</h2><p>Google wasn’t only lazy with
    my name — they robbed us of generics and lambdas. But we have the best <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=LJvEIjRBSDA&feature=emb_logo">anthem</a>.</p><h2>PHP</h2><p>You
    needn’t learn much to use me but one missing bracket is all it takes to hate me.
    We offer no naming conventions or styles by default and are only as bad as you
    make us look.</p><h2>Swift</h2><p>We’re easy on the eyes, concise, and faster
    than many. Not as confusing as Objective-C until you run out of memory.</p><h2>Kotlin</h2><p>We’re
    the language every Java developer deserved. Saving you from the dreaded NPEs and
    verbosity while running on the good old JVM. But you can’t have fun.</p><h2>Rust</h2><p>Not
    as outdated as my name, I provide memory safety, avoid possible race conditions,
    and am averse to garbage collectors. I love borrowing and am stronger than “C”
    only if you have time to learn me.</p><h2>COBOL</h2><p>We resurrect every few
    years and even today the whole unemployment system depends on us. Besides, we
    are hiring.</p><p>Programming jokes are there from the beginning and no language
    is averse to it. Different languages tackle different problems and that’s why
    there are so many. It’s human nature to target languages that are popular. As
    a closing note, I’d like to say — while the above slogans do portray truths, don’t
    take the jokes seriously. Every language has it’s own upsides and downsides and
    I hope this piece gives you a little more push to dig into the foundations of
    a language.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>

  :title: Follow these steps to solve any Dynamic Programming interview problem
  :content: '<p>Despite having significant experience building software products,
    many engineers feel jittery at the thought of going through a coding interview
    that focuses on algorithms. I’ve interviewed hundreds of engineers at <a href="https://refdash.com/?utm_source=dp_blog_f">Refdash</a>,
    Google, and at startups I’ve been a part of, and some of the most common questions
    that make engineers uneasy are the ones that involve Dynamic Programming (DP).</p><p>Many
    tech companies like to ask DP questions in their interviews. While we can debate
    whether they’re effective in evaluating someone’s ability to perform in an engineering
    role, DP continues to be an area that trips engineers up on their way to finding
    a job that they love.</p><h2>Dynamic Programming — Predictable and Preparable</h2><p>One
    of the reasons why I personally believe that DP questions might not be the best
    way to test engineering ability is that they’re predictable and easy to pattern
    match. They allow us to filter much more for preparedness as opposed to engineering
    ability.</p><p>These questions typically seem pretty complex on the outside, and
    might give you an impression that a person who solves them is very good at algorithms.
    Similarly, people who may not be able to get over some mind-twisting concepts
    of DP might seem pretty weak in their knowledge of algorithms.</p><p>The reality
    is different, and the biggest factor in their performance is preparedness. So
    let’s make sure everyone is prepared for it. Once and for all.</p><h2>7 Steps
    to solve a Dynamic Programming problem</h2><p>In the rest of this post, I will
    go over a recipe that you can follow to figure out if a problem is a “DP problem”,
    as well as to figure out a solution to such a problem. Specifically, I will go
    through the following steps:</p><ol><li><p>How to recognize a DP problem</p></li><li><p>Identify
    problem variables</p></li><li><p>Clearly express the recurrence relation</p></li><li><p>Identify
    the base cases</p></li><li><p>Decide if you want to implement it iteratively or
    recursively</p></li><li><p>Add memoization</p></li><li><p>Determine time complexity</p></li></ol><h2>Sample
    DP Problem</h2><p>For the purpose of having an example for abstractions that I
    am going to make, let me introduce a sample problem. In each of the sections,
    I will refer to the problem, but you could also read the sections independently
    of the problem.</p><h3>Problem statement:</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*nFuwjNOKAimpu4PP.gif"
    alt=""></p><p><em>In this problem, we’re on a crazy jumping ball, trying to stop,
    while avoiding spikes along the way.</em></p><h3>Here are the rules:</h3><p>1)
    You’re given a flat runway with a bunch of spikes in it. The runway is represented
    by a boolean array which indicates if a particular (discrete) spot is clear of
    spikes. It is True for clear and False for not clear.</p><p>Example array representation:</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*cydQu8vEPCkDr5St.jpg" alt=""></p><p>2)
    You’re given a starting speed S. S is a non-negative integer at any given point,
    and it indicates how much you will move forward with the next jump.</p><p>3) Every
    time you land on a spot, you can adjust your speed by up to 1 unit before the
    next jump.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*PX6YE42lpuaP0Csy.jpg"
    alt=""></p><p>4) You want to safely stop anywhere along the runway (does not need
    to be at the end of the array). You stop when your speed becomes 0. However, if
    you land on a spike at any point, your crazy bouncing ball bursts and it’s game
    over.</p><p><strong>The output of your function should be a boolean indicating
    whether we can safely stop anywhere along the runway.</strong></p><h3>Step 1:
    How to recognize a Dynamic Programming problem</h3><p>First, let’s make it clear
    that DP is essentially just an optimization technique. DP is a method for solving
    problems by breaking them down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving
    each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions. The next time
    the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, you simply look
    up the previously computed solution. This saves computation time at the expense
    of a (hopefully) modest expenditure in storage space.</p><p>Recognizing that a
    problem can be solved using DP is the first and often the most difficult step
    in solving it. What you want to ask yourself is whether your problem solution
    can be expressed as a function of solutions to similar smaller problems.</p><p>In
    the case of our example problem, given a point on the runway, a speed, and the
    runway ahead, we could determine the spots where we could potentially jump next.
    Furthermore, it seems that whether we can stop from the current point with the
    current speed depends only on whether we could stop from the point we choose to
    go to next.</p><p>That is a great thing, because by moving forward, we shorten
    the runway ahead and make our problem smaller. We should be able to repeat this
    process all the way until we get to a point where it is obvious whether we can
    stop.</p><blockquote><h1>Recognizing a Dynamic Programming problem is often the
    most difficult step in solving it. Can the problem solution be expressed as a
    function of solutions to similar smaller problems?</h1></blockquote><h3>Step 2:
    Identify problem variables</h3><p>Now we have established that there is some recursive
    structure between our subproblems. Next, we need to express the problem in terms
    of the function parameters and see which of those parameters are changing.</p><p>Typically
    in interviews, you will have one or two changing parameters, but technically this
    could be any number. A classic example of a one-changing-parameter problem is
    “determine an n-th Fibonacci number”. Such an example for a two-changing-parameters
    problem is “Compute edit distance between strings”. If you’re not familiar with
    these problems, don’t worry about it.</p><p>A way to determine the number of changing
    parameters is to list examples of several subproblems and compare the parameters.
    Counting the number of changing parameters is valuable to determine the number
    of subproblems we have to solve. It’s also important in its own right in helping
    us strengthen the understanding of the recurrence relation from step 1.</p><p>In
    our example, the two parameters that could change for every subproblem are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Array
    position (P)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Speed (S)</strong></p></li></ol><p>One
    could say that the runway ahead is changing as well, but that would be redundant
    considering that the entire non-changing runway and the position (P) carry that
    information already.</p><p>Now, with these 2 changing parameters and other static
    parameters, we have the complete description of our sub-problems.</p><blockquote><h1>Identify
    the changing parameters and determine the number of subproblems.</h1></blockquote><h3>Step
    3: Clearly express the recurrence relation</h3><p>This is an important step that
    many rush through in order to get into coding. Expressing the recurrence relation
    as clearly as possible will strengthen your problem understanding and make everything
    else significantly easier.</p><p>Once you figure out that the recurrence relation
    exists and you specify the problems in terms of parameters, this should come as
    a natural step. How do problems relate to each other? In other words, let’s assume
    that you have computed the subproblems. How would you compute the main problem?</p><p>Here
    is how we think about it in our sample problem:</p><p>Because you can adjust your
    speed by up to 1 before jumping to the next position, there are only 3 possible
    speeds, and therefore 3 spots in which we could be next.</p><p>More formally,
    if our speed is S, position P, we could go from (S, P) to:</p><ol><li><p><strong>(S,
    P + S)</strong>; # if we do not change the speed</p></li><li><p><strong>(S — 1,
    P + S — 1)</strong>; # if we change the speed by -1</p></li><li><p><strong>(S
    + 1, P + S + 1)</strong>; # if we change the speed by +1</p></li></ol><p>If we
    can find a way to stop in any of the subproblems above, then we can also stop
    from (S, P). This is because we can transition from (S, P) to any of the above
    three options.</p><p>This is typically a fine level of understanding of the problem
    (plain English explanation), but you sometimes might want to express the relation
    mathematically as well. Let’s call a function that we’re trying to compute canStop.
    Then:</p><p><strong>canStop(S, P) = canStop(S, P + S) || canStop(S — 1, P + S
    — 1) || canStop(S + 1, P + S + 1)</strong></p><p>Woohoo, it seems like we have
    our recurrence relation!</p><blockquote><h1>Recurrence relation: Assuming you
    have computed the subproblems, how would you compute the main problem?</h1></blockquote><h3>Step
    4: Identify the base cases</h3><p>A base case is a subproblem that doesn’t depend
    on any other subproblem. In order to find such subproblems, you typically want
    to try a few examples, see how your problem simplifies into smaller subproblems,
    and identify at what point it cannot be simplified further.</p><p>The reason a
    problem cannot be simplified further is that one of the parameters would become
    a value that is not possible given the <strong>constraints</strong> of the problem.</p><p>In
    our example problem, we have two changing parameters, S and P. Let’s think about
    what possible values of S and P might not be legal:</p><ol><li><p><strong>P should
    be within the bounds of the given runway</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>P cannot
    be such that runway[P] is false because that would mean that we’re standing on
    a spike</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>S cannot be negative, and a S==0 indicates
    that we’re done</strong></p></li></ol><p>Sometimes it can be a little challenging
    to convert assertions that we make about parameters into programmable base cases.
    This is because, in addition to listing the assertions if you want to make your
    code look concise and not check for unnecessary conditions, you also need to think
    about which of these conditions are even possible.</p><p>In our example:</p><ol><li><p><strong>P
    &lt; 0 || P &gt;= length of runway</strong> seems like the right thing to do.
    An alternative could be to consider making <em>P == *</em><em>end of runway</em>*
    a base case. However, it is possible that a problem splits into a subproblem which
    goes beyond the end of the runway, so we really need to check for inequality.</p></li><li><p>This
    seems pretty obvious. We can simply check <strong>if runway[P] is false*.</strong>*</p></li><li><p>Similar
    to #1, we could simply check for S &lt; 0 and S == 0. However, here we can reason
    that it is impossible for S to be &lt; 0 because S decreases by at most 1, so
    it would have to go through S == 0 case beforehand. Therefore <strong>S == 0</strong>
    is a sufficient base case for the S parameter.</p></li></ol><h3>Step 5: Decide
    if you want to implement it iteratively or recursively</h3><p>The way we talked
    about the steps so far might lead you to think that we should implement the problem
    recursively. However, everything that we’ve talked about so far is completely
    agnostic to whether you decide to implement the problem recursively or iteratively.
    In both approaches, you would have to determine the recurrence relation and the
    base cases.</p><p><strong>To decide whether to go iteratively or recursively,
    you want to carefully think about the trade-offs</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3212/1*14frJpU2HO-XdZd-BCbI5Q.png"
    alt=""></p><p><strong>Stack overflow issues are typically a deal breaker</strong>
    and a reason why you would not want to have recursion in a (backend) production
    system. However, for the purposes of the interview, as long as you mention the
    trade-offs, you should typically be fine with either of the implementations. You
    should feel comfortable implementing both.</p><p><strong>In our particular problem,
    I implemented both versions. Here is python code for that:</strong> A recursive
    solution: (original code snippets can be found <a href="http://blog.refdash.com/dynamic-programming-tutorial-example/">here</a>)</p><p><img

    iterative solution: (original code snippets can be found <a href="http://blog.refdash.com/dynamic-programming-tutorial-example/">here</a>)</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2944/1*611hqW53bP1HeVo6Hwf4bA.png" alt=""></p><h3>Step
    6: Add memoization</h3><p><strong>Memoization</strong> is a technique that is
    closely associated with DP. It is used for storing the results of expensive function
    calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.</p><p>Why
    are we adding memoization to our recursion? We encounter the same subproblems
    which, without memoization, are computed repeatedly. Those repetitions very often
    lead to exponential time complexities.</p><p>In recursive solutions, adding memoization
    should feel straightforward. Let’s see why. Remember that memoization is just
    a cache of the function results. There are times when you want to deviate from
    this definition in order to squeeze out some minor optimizations, but treating
    memoization as a function result cache is the most intuitive way to implement
    it.</p><p>This means that you should:</p><ol><li><p>Store your function result
    into your memory before every <em>return</em> <em>statement</em></p></li><li><p>Look
    up the memory for the function result before you start doing any other computation</p></li></ol><p>Here
    is the code from above with added memoization (added lines are highlighted): (original
    code snippets can be found <a href="http://blog.refdash.com/dynamic-programming-tutorial-example/">here</a>)</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2960/1*Vjt1BJZgyOv8OcN_8zycQg.png" alt=""></p><p>In
    order to illustrate the effectiveness of memoization and different approaches,
    let’s do some quick tests. I will stress test all three methods that we have seen
    so far. Here is the set up:</p><ol><li><p>I created a runway of length 1000 with
    spikes in random places (I chose to have a probability of a spike being in any
    given spot to be 20%)</p></li><li><p>initSpeed = 30</p></li><li><p>I ran all functions
    10 times and measured the average time of execution</p></li></ol><p>Here are the
    results (in seconds):</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3020/1*yAskv9eymV_wDTXeB3aA2A.png"
    alt=""></p><p>You can see that the pure recursive approach takes about 500x more
    time than the iterative approach and about 1300x more time than the recursive
    approach with memoization. Note that this discrepancy would grow rapidly with
    the length of the runway. I encourage you to try running it yourself.</p><h3>Step
    7: Determine Time complexity</h3><p>There are some simple rules that can make
    computing time complexity of a dynamic programming problem much easier. Here are
    two steps that you need to do:</p><ol><li><p>Count the number of states — this
    will depend on the number of changing parameters in your problem</p></li><li><p>Think
    about the work done per each state. In other words, if everything else but one
    state has been computed, how much work do you have to do to compute that last
    state?</p></li></ol><p>In our example problem, the number of states is <strong>|P|
    * |S|,</strong> where</p><ul><li><p>P is the set of all positions (|P| indicates
    the number of elements in P)</p></li><li><p>S is the set of all speeds</p></li></ul><p>The
    work done per each state is O(1) in this problem because, given all other states,
    we simply have to look at 3 subproblems to determine the resulting state.</p><p>As
    we noted in the code before, |S| is limited by length of the runway (|P|), so
    we could say that the number of states is |P|² and because work done per each
    state is O(1), then the total time complexity is O(|P|²).</p><p>However, it seems
    that |S| can be further limited, because if it were really |P|, it is very clear
    that stopping would not be possible because you would have to jump the length
    of the entire runway on the first move.</p><p>So let’s see how we can put a tighter
    bound on |S|. Let’s call maximum speed S. Assume that we’re starting from position
    0. How quickly could we stop if we were trying to stop as soon as possible and
    if we ignore potential spikes?</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*vjwg_sWQXrUgXhgZ.jpg"
    alt=""></p><p>In the first iteration, we would have to come at least to the point
    (S-1), by adjusting our speed at zero by -1. From there we would at a minimum
    go by (S-2) steps forward, and so on.</p><p>For a runway of <strong>length L</strong>,
    the following has to hold:</p><p><strong>=&gt; (S-1) + (S-2) + (S-3) + ….+ 1 &lt;
    L</strong></p><p><strong>=&gt; S*(S-1) / 2 &lt; L</strong></p><p><strong>=&gt;
    S² — S — 2L &lt; 0</strong></p><p>If you find roots of the above function, they
    will be:</p><p><strong>r1 = 1/2 + sqrt(1/4 + 2L) and r2 = 1/2 — sqrt(1/4 + 2L)</strong></p><p>We
    can write our inequality as:</p><p><strong>(S — r1) * (S — r2) &lt; 0</strong></p><p>Considering
    that S — r2 &gt; 0 for any S &gt; 0 and L &gt; 0, we need the following:</p><p><strong>S
    — 1/2 — sqrt(1/4 + 2L) &lt; 0</strong></p><p><strong>=&gt; S &lt; 1/2 + sqrt(1/4
    + 2L)</strong></p><p>That is the maximum speed that we could possibly have on
    a runway of a length L. If we had a speed higher than that, we could not stop
    even theoretically, irrespective of the position of the spikes.</p><p>That means
    that the total time complexity depends only on the length of the runway L in the
    following form:</p><p>O(L * sqrt(L)) which is better than O(L²)</p><blockquote><p><em>O(L
    * sqrt(L)) is the upper bound on the time complexity</em></p></blockquote><p>Awesome,
    you made it through! :)</p><p>The 7 steps that we went through should give you
    a framework for systematically solving any dynamic programming problem. I highly
    recommend practicing this approach on a few more problems to perfect your approach.</p><h2><strong>Here
    are some next steps that you can take</strong></h2><ol><li><p>Extend the sample
    problem by trying to find a path to a stopping point. We solved a problem that
    tells you whether you can stop, but what if you wanted to also know the steps
    to take in order to stop eventually along the runway? How would you modify the
    existing implementation to do that?</p></li><li><p>If you want to solidify your
    understanding of memoization, and understand that it is just a function result
    cache, you should read about decorators in Python or similar concepts in other
    languages. Think about how they would allow you to implement memoization in general
    for any function that you want to memoize.</p></li><li><p>Work on more DP problems
    by following the steps we went through. You can always find a bunch of them online
    (ex. <a href="https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/">LeetCode</a> or <a
    href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/">GeeksForGeeks</a>). As
    you practice, keep in mind one thing: learn ideas, don’t learn problems. The number
    of ideas is significantly smaller and it’s an easier space to conquer which will
    also serve you much better.</p></li></ol><p>When you feel like you’ve conquered

    traditional degree can be costly, especially if you’re thinking about a career
    change or don’t want to rack up a large student loan. While community colleges
    and local institutions tend to be much lower in cost, you might be unsure about
    such a long-term commitment or have family-related logistics to coordinate. Or
    maybe you just want to formally upgrade your skills without taking three years
    off.</p><p>Here are nine courses where you can learn coding for <strong>free</strong>.
    The best part is that you can also get certified by ivy league institutes or industry
    leaders like Google, AWS, Microsoft, and IBM.</p><p><strong>For the courses listed
    here, learning the content and completing the associated materials is often free
    but getting the accreditation for it can cost a little, depending on the provider
    and institution.</strong></p><h3><a href="https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-computer-science-for-web-programming">1.
    Computer Science for Web Programming</a></h3><p><strong>Course by HarvardX.</strong></p><p>This
    certificate contains one course that’s broken up into two parts. Both parts are
    free. The price of a verified certificate is about the same as a week’s worth
    of groceries for one person, so it’s not too bad.</p><p>The first part covers
    the introductory component to web programming and touches on C, Python, SQL, JavaScript,
    CSS and HTML. The second part deals with more in-depth topics and includes Git,
    using APIs, SQL, scalability, testing, and various front end technologies.</p><p>All
    in all, the entire course can be completed in approximately 20 weeks. But, because
    it’s self-paced, it can be completed faster.</p><h3><a href="https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-computer-science-and-mobile-apps">2.
    Computer Science and Mobile Apps</a></h3><p><strong>Course by HarvardX.</strong></p><p>This
    is another professional certificate by Harvard University via EdX. The first part
    of this course is the same as above — the second half sends you down a mobile
    application specialty with React Native.</p><p>If you’re looking specifically
    to get into front end development, the previously listed course is better suited.
    But if you’re looking to have cross-functional skills with mobile development,
    then this track may be right for you.</p><p>Whatever you end up choosing, you
    can still do the other path in conjunction since the content will eventually crop
    up in real-life scenarios.</p><h3><a href="https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/microsoft-artificial-intelligence">3.
    Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a></h3><p><strong>Course by Microsoft.</strong></p><p>This
    course is a bit more expensive to complete. However, it consists of 11 different
    courses with a focus on Python. Each course has its own certified certificate,
    with all 11 adding up to a professional certificate from Microsoft.</p><p>It’s
    self-paced and the expected workload is approximately 4–6 hours per week — or
    an hour a night if you’re looking to slowly digest the content. Because it’s self-paced
    you can finish it faster if you have more time you can devote to it.</p><p>The
    course includes deep learning, ethics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.</p><h3><a
    href="https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/microsoft-introduction-to-computer-science">4.
    Introduction to Computer Science</a></h3><p><strong>Course by Microsoft.</strong></p><p>This
    certification consists of three courses and deals mainly with Python. The program
    is aimed at absolute beginners, which means that you’re not expected to know anything
    at all about programming.</p><p>It’s 100% self-paced and you can work through
    the program without needing to pay anything for access.</p><p>If you’re looking
    for a starting foundational course, the free content in this one can help kickstart
    your career in tech. However, it’s important to note that this course is very
    Python-centric — which isn’t a bad thing, but if you’re looking for a general
    course, perhaps because your mind is better suited to generalist ways of learning,
    then the Harvard courses may be better for you.</p><h3><a href="https://www.edx.org/xseries/mitx-computational-thinking-using-python">5.
    Computational Thinking Using Python</a></h3><p><strong>Course by Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology.</strong></p><p>This is another beginner course, aimed
    at people who want to get started and test the waters with programming but don’t
    know where to start.</p><p>The length of time required to complete this program
    (estimated at 5 months 14–16 hours per week commitment) suggests that the program
    is meatier in content.</p><p>The program overview says that you don’t need prior
    experience in computer science-related subjects and topics to get started. This
    means you’ll learn the important concepts that make up the foundation of computational
    thinking.</p><h3><a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/gcp-architecture#faq">6.
    Architecting with Google Compute Engine</a></h3><p><strong>Course by Google Cloud.</strong></p><p>Cloud
    computing is the flavor of the coming decade and this course was created by Google
    to help you understand and work with their technologies.</p><p>You’ll learn about
    infrastructure, the core services Google offers, how they work, as well as concepts
    and theories about cloud computing.</p><p>This course is suited for those who
    already have some programming skills and want to upgrade into a true full-stack
    developer.</p><p>Just because they can boot up something in the cloud, it doesn’t
    instantly make you a true full-stack developer. Cloud infrastructure and architecture
    is a complex creature, as complex as all the other parts of development work,
    and this certification track can bolster your knowledge and make you a better
    full stack developer.</p><h3><a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cloud-computing">7.
    Cloud Computing</a></h3><p><strong>Course by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</strong></p><p>The
    courses in this track are part of their Master in Computer Science degree. However,
    the content track for this certification is geared toward becoming an expert in
    cloud computing theories and technologies.</p><p>It also touches on big data and
    how to deal with it in the cloud.</p><p>This track is not for beginners and is
    better suited to those who already have experience in development work and maybe
    some years working with applications. It’s more of an upgrading of skill and knowledge.</p><h3><a
    href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/it-fundamentals-cybersecurity">8.
    IT Fundamentals for Cybersecurity</a></h3><p><strong>Course by IBM.</strong></p><p>This
    course is created by IBM and aimed at beginners looking to get a better understanding
    of cybersecurity and how application building processes work.</p><p>The course
    content deals with security protocols, cybersecurity frameworks, and how cyber-attacks
    happen.</p><p>Security is often one of the last things on people’s minds — until
    something happens. Then the magnificent Captain Hindsight kicks in! Having a good
    foundation in security that can help prevent these kinds of occurrences.</p><p>You
    don’t have to be a coder to start this program, or even be looking to learn how
    to code. Rather, this course is suitable for all, regardless of your current discipline.</p><h3><a
    href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/blockchain">9. Blockchain</a></h3><p><strong>Course
    by University at Buffalo and The State University of New York.</strong></p><p>Who
    isn’t talking about blockchain nowadays? It’s everywhere. But the issue with blockchain
    is that while there’s a lot of hype, a lot of people don’t really know what it
    is, what it does, or how it works.</p><p>This is your chance to upgrade your skillset
    and get started on something that’s being touted as the next frontier of technology.
    It’s a different way of thinking about programming and how to create applications.</p><p>Blockchain
    is a revolution in action and this is your opportunity to be part of it.</p><h2>Final
    Thoughts</h2><p>Taking a structured course can help you get out of the self-taught
    route and take you out of the tutorial rut by giving you a structure to topics
    and idea paths that you may not be aware of.</p><p>The main perk of the courses
    listed above is that they’re all free. That means that unless you want the certificate
    for showing purposes, the knowledge itself is free. The only cost is the initial
    time investment you put in.</p><p>Becoming a crafter of code is a constant act
    of learning. It doesn’t matter where you are in your journey right now, learning
    is an activity that all the best developers have in common.</p><p><em>Edit: For
    people who are saying there are no links, click on the title of the course. The
    underline is not decorative.</em></p><p><em>Second edit: For the people who are
    saying that the courses are not free, *</em>getting accredited is not free but
    you still have access to the course materials*<em>. If you want to get certified,
    you have to pay for the certificate — which is different and additional from actual
    learning and doing the course material. It may not be obvious at first, but if
    you click around, sign up, join a class etc, you don’t have to pay for anything
    to get access. It’s free. I’ve personally signed up and checked. If I can figure
    it out, I’m sure you can too.</em></p>'

    of the common questions we get when it comes to learning how to program, is: “What
    are some good ideas for projects to build?”</p><p>Now, we hear the common cliche
    answers often, like “build a chess game” or “command line interface”. There is
    nothing wrong with these answers.</p><p>However, we think these examples don’t
    match modern programming needs. A big portion of modern software is SaaS and web
    apps. This means you need to know how to program online.</p><p>There are a lot
    more complexities that go into programming a website, or app, that has users,
    requires servers, authentication, and databases. This forces you to interact with
    technologies you’ll never need when developing a command line tic-tac-toe game.</p><p>Some
    of this can also be managed by AWS and other third parties that are commonly used

    well as help you learn how to use new technologies.</p><p><strong>Tip</strong>:
    If you pick a complex project, then focus on building one feature at a time. Building
    an entire website or app all at once is difficult. Start by building a login page,
    or maybe the main landing page after the user logs in. If you try to take on the
    whole project at once then you will likely fail.<a href="https://skilled.dev"><strong>Coding

    A web scraper that posts top 10 blogs without human intervention</h3><p>One of
    the issues we find with some project recommendation posts, is that they recommend
    projects that aren’t implemented in a way that excites the programmer to continue
    development. For instance, I see that a lot of people recommend building a web
    scraper.</p><p>Once you’ve built that web scraper and scraped the data, what are
    you going to do with it?</p><p>Instead of just scraping the data, why not build
    a website with that data. It doesn’t have to be fancy or get a lot of views. This
    scraper could pull the data into a database and then select the most popular posts.
    From there it could copy the title, along with a few sentences, and then create
    a post that it shares online. This would be an impressive and simple project that
    you can actually show off.</p><p>You’ve now shown that you can do more than just
    code a small segment of a system. Instead, you can think through an entire system.
    You need to consider how you are going to automate the process, manage the database,
    create the website and select the posts. This also allows you to actually have
    a tangible end product.</p><p>Without a tangible end product, it’s really easy
    to become unmotivated and simply stop at only a web scraper.</p><p>In addition,

    APIs</a>, that will warn you when keywords are in event descriptions or titles?
    Now, I assume both Meetup and Eventbrite have similar options. But it is always
    fun to try to build your own system.</p><p>You can customize the system to work
    the way you want, and maybe even allow other people to make their own alerts by
    making this a website. What we enjoy about this project is that you can practice
    working with two different APIs. This will allow you to compare and contract what
    you like and dislike about them. That way, if you’re ever in charge of building
    an API, you’ll have a better picture of what works and what doesn’t.</p><p>*<em>Skills:

    friend for a gift. It could allow the end user to either create an account or
    just get a gift recommendation.</p><p>Again, this allows for the opportunity to
    create an account which requires authentication, database development, etc.</p><p>Also,
    another great part about this project is you can use Amazon’s API for affiliate
    links. This will allow you to do a few things. One, learn about how to use APIs
    and get you comfortable with reading API documentation. Two, if you do it well,
    you can get a commission for each product someone buys.</p><p>This project also
    has an opportunity to try to create a basic machine learning model. You can create
    a quiz of sorts that tries to figure out what the best gift is and then, based
    on if people click the gift or not, can drive the model to learn based on the
    response rate.</p><p>*<em>Skills: *</em>APIs, database, general programming, and
    app development.</p><h3>5. A site for bartering and trading</h3><p>Think OfferUp,
    but instead of money, why not create a website that only allows trades. This concept
    will force you to develop several features that need some thought. You won’t be
    able to just attack this project without a plan.</p><p>How will people post, where
    will people find recently posted items and how will people search. All of these
    are separate features you can build. In addition, you need to think how users
    will interact, and maybe even how they actually make the trade.</p><p>The idea
    doesn’t have to be 100% practical for real life — it needs to be practical in
    the sense of improving your skill set as a programmer.</p><p>*<em>Skills: *</em>Database,
    web development, general programming, and app development (if you choose to make
    it an app).</p><h2>B2B</h2><h3>6. Invoice and contract management system</h3><p>Contract
    and invoice management are very complex processes. Contracts can have a lot of
    nuanced clauses and stipulations that can be difficult to track.</p><p>This makes
    this a very good project, even if you simplify it to some of its core components.
    Having to translate a complex business process into software is not easy. But
    it is what makes this project a good challenge.</p><p>Again, we wouldn’t overcomplicate
    this. Take a basic feature, like inputting the terms of a contract, and develop
    this part first. Then you can add other features like invoice tracking, contract
    analytics and forecasting.</p><p>*<em>Skills: *</em>Process management, database,
    web development, and general programming.</p><h3>7. Task management system</h3><p>Task
    boards like <a href="https://kanbanflow.com/">KanbanFlow</a> are built with several
    modular features that make it a great project to play around with. It will take
    a little work to get started, as you will need to set up a UI that is robust and
    dynamic as well. In fact, this project would be more of a two person job. One
    person to work on the front end and another person to work on the back end.</p><p>Don’t
    let that discourage you! This is actually a chance for you to work on your communication
    and team work skills. You will need to talk through designs to make sure you both
    fully understand it, and you know where your modules will be connecting.</p><p>This
    is always more challenging than it seems.</p><p>*<em>Skills: *</em>Communication,
    front end, database, web development, and general programming.</p><h3>8. A job
    board</h3><p>Any project that forces you to allow users to input as various *types
    *of users adds an interesting design aspect. How will you ensure that the way
    employers experience the site meets their needs vs. prospecting job searchers?
    Like most of the other projects, you don’t need to focus on all of it at once.
    Start out by trying to create the ability to create a job posting first. Then
    you can go and focus on the job searchers and how they respond.</p><p>*<em>Skills:
    *</em>Database, web development, and general programming.</p><h3>9. A website
    that forecasts profits based on standardized data sets</h3><p>There are a lot
    of data sets that are very standardized for most companies. This includes accounting
    data which is usually based on cost centers, accounts, line descriptions, and
    finally the actual transaction cost.</p><p>What is great about the standardization
    of any data set, is that it makes it easy to create analytics on top of said data
    sets. Why not create a standardized dashboard that can help companies predict
    spend, see monthly outgoings, and possibly help them improve their spending.</p><p>For
    this project you will probably have to spend a lot of time learning about how
    to make sure you keep your data secure. Of course, we recommend first trying to
    build the modules that focus on uptaking and standardizing the data and displaying
    it, before you go too deep into security. That’s a rabbit hole you may never escape!</p><p>*<em>Skills:
    *</em>Forecasting, business logic, database, web development, and general programming</p><h2>Game
    Ideas</h2><h3>10. Snake</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*_rCcV52oR-_UaWC55kWHzA.gif"
    alt=""></p><p>If you had a cellphone in the early 2000s, you’ve probably played
    Snake. It’s a simple game but you can always try to make things more complex!
    First, start by just trying to make the game.</p><p>This will require you to figure
    out how to develop a game online. This <a href="https://codepen.io/SebastianOpperman/pen/GaqevN?&page=1">neon
    Snake by Sebastian Opperman</a> is a great place to start. But after that, maybe
    you can add some cool new features like special items or special powers.</p><p>This
    would be a chance to play around and have fun. This project won’t be as technical
    from the stand point of having lots of users that sign up and use your site. However,
    it is a good challenge to figure out how to make a game run online.</p><p>*<em>Skills:
    *</em>Web development, general programming, and UI</p><p>We do hope this list
    inspires you to create an awesome new project that you can add to your resume
    and talk about in interviews. Maybe we’ll see you as the next CEO of a billion
    dollar startup!</p>'

  :title: 30 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming
  :content: '<p>30 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Programming</p><h3>So you want
    to be a programmer; this list can set you on the right path</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4204/1*B3ysXbYEZXbJL6Aolyo7ug.png"
    alt="@timmossholder unsplash.com"><em>@timmossholder unsplash.com</em></p><iframe
    src="https://medium.com/media/a0f6bc611df4cae29e7013e4119d0e57" frameborder=0></iframe><p>Programming
    is not an easy career. With many people graduating each year from top computer
    science programs in the country, it’s one of the most competitive careers anyone
    can embark on. At the same time, a programming career is exciting. With the advancement
    of technology, every day, there are innovations in the industry. Programming becomes
    a passionate endeavor for those who love it.</p><p>When I started as a programmer
    more than 15 years ago, I wish someone sat me down and told me everything on this
    list. This list can save any new programmer a lot of headaches and energy. This
    list can be the one you refer to as your programming career progresses. Even if
    some of these points might not be relevant for you right now, one day you will
    see the wisdom in them.</p><p>As a programmer, you are at the cusp of greatness.</p><p>You
    just have to venture on with a little bit of knowledge about your path.</p><h2>1.
    You Don’t Need a Degree to Program, but You Do Need the Knowledge</h2><p>I worked
    with many programmers who didn’t graduate with a computer science master’s degree
    or an undergraduate degree in computer science. Programming is one of the few
    careers you can have that doesn’t depend on a degree. However, programming is
    a knowledge-intensive career. You have to <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/10-books-every-programmer-should-read-6e5b7547e8b5">read
    those ten essential books</a> if you’re going to start a career in programming.
    These ten books will cover the essential concepts of computer science as well
    as how to work on project teams. Setting a firm foundation for your technical
    skills, with a solid understanding of the basic concepts, on top of writing functional
    code, will enable you to ace technical interviews and communicate with your co-workers.</p><h2>2.
    Programming Takes Creativity on Top of Problem-Solving Skills</h2><p>Most people
    have the preconception that programming is all about analytical and problem-solving
    skills. That is partially true. Programming also involves a lot of creativity.
    Often, there are many ways to write a given piece of code. The creativity comes
    when you devise ways to code most simply and effectively.</p><h2>3. You Can’t
    Learn Everything There Is to Learn. The Trick Is to Learn a Few Things Very Well</h2><p>There
    are hundreds of programming languages out there. There are areas of programming
    that pave the way for particular career paths: web developer, front-end developer,
    back-end developer, software engineer, database developer, etc. Decide what kind
    of developer you want to be, then learn all the technologies and skillsets needed
    for that particular position.</p><h2>4. You Don’t Need to Be a Robot. It’s Better
    If You Are Human</h2><p>Remember you are a human first and a programmer second.
    It’s easy to get lost in your code when you first start to program. There are
    days when I don’t leave my computer until I’ve completed all the milestones of
    my project. But you are a human being; you need to laugh, cry, de-stress and talk
    to people. By managing your life to maximize fun and excitement outside of work,
    you will bring more creativity into your work as a programmer.</p><h2>5. Programming
    Is All About Applying Knowledge. It’s Not About Memorization</h2><p>Unlike research,
    where you are inventing and creating new areas of knowledge, programming is all
    about applying existing knowledge. Books, research papers, online articles, and
    learning videos become resources that you will use often. There’s no need to memorize
    anything. You can always reach for a resource to find the answer. Memorization
    comes automatically and naturally as you work on more projects.</p><h2>6. You
    Will Deal With Imposter Syndrome Every Day</h2><p>Programming is the one career
    all the “smart” people seem to gravitate towards. Unless you are a genius, you
    will, like I do, experience imposter syndrome every day. When you experience it
    every day, you tend to figure out a way to deal with it. For me, I’ve always used
    it as motivation to learn new things. I’ve learned to put it into perspective
    and just be content at improving a little bit each day.</p><h2>7. You Have to
    Have a Life Outside of Being a Programmer. Otherwise, You’ll Just Be Addicted
    to Programming</h2><p>There will be times when you are a hermit at home. However,
    to be a happy programmer, you have to proactively seek a life outside your computer
    screen. Often the success of your career depends on the people you meet. Networking
    is essential when you are a programmer. Having a personality outside of being
    a programmer is essential to keep yourself from being addicted to programming.
    When you can enjoy your passions without being compelled to do it, your best work
    comes out.</p><h2>8. You’ll Learn Programming Faster If You Pair Program With
    Someone</h2><p>At the beginning of your career, you’ll be tempted to close your
    door to the world and read those ten books on programming to build your computer
    science foundations. Guess what? You learn much faster if you find a buddy. I’ve
    gone through programming books in half the time working on a project with a buddy.
    When you pair program with someone, all your programming “warts” come out. Your
    code will be critiqued. You will learn to write efficient code because someone
    else is watching. You will want to find out the best way to do things because
    your buddy is learning too. When you work as a programmer, someone’s always reviewing
    your code. You are never programming alone. It’s time to get used to that.</p><h2>9.
    You Don’t Need to Be Good at Math and Science</h2><p>In the technology industry,
    you will meet all kinds of superstar programmers who found the logical thinking
    aspect of programming appealing after a lifetime of liberal arts education. There
    are plenty of painters and writers who make a living programming while pursuing
    art on the side. All you need to be a good programmer is persistence. Programming
    is hard work. But once you have that, anyone can go through programming books
    and pick up the basics. There are plenty of people who pick up math after working
    in the industry for a while. Eventually, these people can even understand complex
    algorithms and implement them without any kind of formal math education.</p><h2>10.
    You Need to Be an All-Star “Learner”</h2><p>A programmer is a master learner.
    You might not start out being a master learner. But you will get there. Sometimes
    your workplace will ask you to pick up three programming languages in six months.
    That’s the state of technology innovation. As programmers, we learn every day.
    Learning is like breathing. If you are uncomfortable with learning every day,
    you will be forced to get used to that.</p><h2>11. You Will Obsess About Finishing
    Your Projects</h2><p>Coding addiction is a real thing. At some point in your programming
    career, you will experience all-night programming marathons. You won’t want to
    go to sleep until you’ve finished your milestones. You’ll forget to eat, drink,
    or even get up from your desk because your brain is processing so much information.
    That is okay. Once you are done, take a walk outside. Go on vacation.</p><h2>12.
    You Will Spend All Day Looking for One Tiny Bug</h2><p>Most of the time, on programming
    projects, many pieces are interdependent on one another. Often, you will find
    that you cannot move on unless you’ve fixed one tiny bug that’s been lurking in
    your system. As a programmer, you will stress about the entire project unless
    you find this bug. You will sit at your computer all day looking for it. You will
    dream about the code at night until you find it.</p><h2>13. You Will Spend Most
    of Your Time Googling for Answers That No One Can Answer for You</h2><p>If you
    program in a popular language, you’ll be able to find the answers to most of the
    problems you encounter online. However, there are exceptions. Sometimes, no one
    has encountered the problems you bumped into. In this case, referring to programming
    books and asking around on programming boards often will point you in the right
    direction.</p><h2>14. You Will Read a Design Pattern Book</h2><p>It doesn’t matter
    if you graduated from the best computer science program in the country. There
    comes a time in every programmer’s career that you will sit down and read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007124/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596007124&linkCode=as2&tag=softwareyoga-20&linkId=6EN6QYLGGL25CS4Z">Head
    First Design Patterns</a> from cover to cover. It’s probably one of the most read
    books for a new programmer. So, what are you waiting for? Pick it up and read
    it from cover to cover.</p><h2>15. You Will Learn to Obsess About the Exact Spelling</h2><p>At
    some point in every programmer’s career, you will have written enough code in
    your favorite language to want to do things your way. This includes the exact
    spelling of naming conventions that you give to your variables, your classes,
    and even the tables in your databases. You will scrutinize this to no end. The
    last thing you want is some bug that crept up because you misspelled a name. Remember,
    it’s okay to obsess about things if you have a good reason for it. When you don’t
    have a good reason for it, it’s just repetitive behavior.</p><h2>16. You Will
    Give Up</h2><p>How many times have I given up? I can’t even count. Sometimes you
    just bump into problems you can’t solve. Sometimes it gets so difficult that you
    just want to quit. Sometimes work environments make you want to quit. Your passions
    depend on your persistence. This is when you are tested. Are you here to stay
    or are you going to go? I always came back. Sometimes, after a few years of not
    programming a single line, I always came back as a new person ready to tackle
    a project. This is when you know you love your work. It’s when it becomes a home,
    a springboard for your adventures.</p><h2>17. You Will Restart</h2><p>If you believe
    in higher powers, you will be able to relate to this. Each time, when I see people
    come back to programming, it’s never about the money. It’s always for the love
    of programming. When you see someone who enjoys programming like you used to,
    you are envious. You can’t let it go. Then, suddenly, you are back pursuing a
    project. You know in your core that you live and breathe code. This is when you
    know that you are a true programmer.</p><h2>18. You Will Go Back to Some Form
    of School to Learn the “Correct” Way of Doing Things</h2><p>Even the best programmers
    graduating from elite computer science master’s programs will continue their education
    at work. In fact, on the job training is one of the best perks of working for
    large technology companies. Companies will send you on “expensive” courses and
    seminars to train you in the latest technologies they want you to use. If by chance,
    you’re still not learning enough at work, you will reach out to the many online
    coding academies and youtube videos to sharpen your skillsets.</p><h2>19. You
    Will Be Hired by Someone You Don’t Want to Work For</h2><p>Even if you are a mediocre
    programmer, there will come a time when certain companies will need your skills.
    When they are interviewing you, try to remember that you are interviewing them
    too. Depending on the company’s culture, you might find yourself wanting to say
    “no” to a cushy package. As a programmer, you will work long hours. It’s almost
    critical to find a company culture that you can fit into. Happiness leads to better
    work. If your skills are in demand, other companies will knock on your door. Please
    do not settle unless it’s necessary.</p><h2>20. You Will Flunk a Technical Interview</h2><p>Technical
    interviews are no joke. Senior programmers often make up technical interview questions
    for fun. Often, these questions are extra difficult for a reason. If you flunk
    the technical interview, it’s not the end of the world. It certainly does not
    say anything about your programming abilities. It only tests your knowledge base.
    Try to look on the bright side. If your people skills shine, managers will remember
    you. If they like you and you are not a fit for this role, they might still call
    you for another position.</p><h2>21. You Will Be Told That You Are Great</h2><p>At
    times in your career, you will feel like you are a star. Managers who depend on
    you to complete their projects will tell you how great you are to motivate you.
    You will feel like you are on top of the world. Remember that they are appealing
    to your ego. Stay grounded. There are always new technologies to learn. There
    are always new programmers who are better than you.</p><h2>22. You Will Be Told
    That You Don’t Know Anything</h2><p>At times in your career, you will feel like
    you don’t know anything. Someone who is frustrated with the project will make
    it a point to tell you that you don’t know anything. Perhaps they do this to put
    you in your place. But, since you are reading this, you will take it in stride.
    Because you probably know a lot more than you think you do. Each day that passes,
    you will learn a little more than the day before. After a year, people will look
    up to you. Keep at it. After some time, you may even gain the respect of the person
    who told you that you don’t know anything.</p><h2>23. You Will Want to Compete
    With Other Programmers Who You Admire</h2><p>One of the most awesome aspects of
    programming is competition. I love programming with people who I admire. When
    you can write code that a programmer you admire deems worthy, you will feel like
    you just won the lottery. Competition in programming is always in good fun. It’s
    not about who’s the best. It’s more about learning from each other.</p><h2>24.
    You Will Not Understand a Word That Your Coworkers Just Said</h2><p>In the beginning,
    this may happen once a week or once a month. At your new programming job, you
    will not understand what your coworker just said. This could be for two reasons.
    For the life of you, you just can’t get your head around their accent. In this
    case, ask another coworker to translate. There’s no shame in not being able to
    understand someone’s speech. Chances are, it took other coworkers years to get
    used to the accent too. The other reason is that what your coworker just said
    went completely over your head. That is also okay. After all, your coworker is
    the expert. Ask your coworker to explain it all in picture form. You’re going
    to want to pull up a chair for this. Chances are, it might take a while.</p><h2>25.
    You Will Feel Shame Looking at the Spaghetti Code You Wrote Last Year</h2><p>This
    happens all the time. I was criticized for my Perl code when I started. It was
    well-documented code that’s designed well, too. But I wrote it in a language that
    was difficult to read. So, I wrote the spaghetti code. But, each year, no matter
    how hard I try, I still find some spaghetti code that I whipped up quickly to
    get a job done. That’s what programmers do. We fix things and we patch things
    up. There’s no shame in that. When you realize that it’s you who wrote it, just
    step back and fix it if you can.</p><h2>26. You Will Take Shelter in Your Database
    Projects When You Are Too Sick to Look at Another Line of Code</h2><p>This happens
    when you’re on a nice programming trek up the mountain. It’s been two months.
    You need a break. But you love the momentum so you keep going. Then you realize
    that SQL is fun. You can’t figure out why you can’t look at another line of code.
    But somehow, putting data into the database and getting it out is now a joyful
    event. You revel in the simplicity of a completely logical language.</p><h2>27.
    You Will Both Love and Hate Hackathons</h2><p>Hackathons are common these days.
    Programmers get into teams and compete with each other. In the process, it’s intense
    learning in a few hours. You will love the hackathons for the camaraderie. You
    will hate it for the carpal tunnel syndrome that you developed while typing at
    top speed. You will also hate it for the crowded rooms that you work in and the
    sensory overstimulation that you receive during the event.</p><h2>28. You Will
    Think You Don’t Understand a Word of English While Reading Research Papers</h2><p>Do
    you speak English? Well, most people will say yes. But, I guarantee you that you
    will read some research paper over and over again and realize that it’s way over
    your head. For me, most of the research papers on algorithms seemed like a giant
    forest before I learned the foundations of college math. Then, suddenly, it all
    seemed to make sense.</p><h2>29. You Will Buy Headphones</h2><p>At some point
    in your career, you will realize that any kind of noise impedes your senses when
    you’re intensely focused on your code. Having good headphones that will cancel
    out external noise will allow you to work in crowded rooms with focus. At some
    point, you will also find that music helps you to code. I found out early in my
    coding career that the rhythm in music helps me code fluidly. Even now, I reach
    for some music when I need to be productive.</p><h2>30. You Will Go to an Offsite.
    If You Are Lucky, It Will Be in Las Vegas.</h2><p>At some point in your career,
    you are in the inner sanctum of the group of developers who are very important
    to your company. This is when you will be invited to an offsite. An offsite is
    a place where technology professionals socialize together. Upper management may
    use the chance to get to know you. Don’t get me wrong. It’s not the time to be
    carefree and just get drunk. It’s the time to socialize and network with your
    peers. If you are lucky, the setting will be in Las Vegas. Sometimes, it will
    also include a convention or conference with technologists from other companies.</p>'

  :title: I’m Programming on a Macbook and Here Are the Tools That Make My Life Easier
  :content: '<p>Photo by Lachlan Donald on Unsplash</p><p>I could spend days just
    tweaking things on my computer. Actually, I do. Whenever I see something annoying,
    I want to drop everything and try to fix it right away. It can be anything. From
    a minor: <em>“Hey, I just run the same command twice, I should create an alias!”</em>
    to installing random tools ( <em>“Hmm, I’m wondering if there is a way to get
    notifications when a long-running job in a terminal finishes, so I can do other
    stuff in the meantime?”</em>). I also love to read what tools other people are
    using. This time, I’ve decided to share mine.</p><p>Since this is a very long
    post, I’ve to split it into two parts: the Mac apps and the CLI stuff (coming
    soon!).</p><h3><a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a></h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/0*hecsICDmq2M5YA9g.jpg"
    alt=""></p><p>Alfred is a launcher — this app that opens when you press ⌘+Spacebar
    and lets you quickly open other apps. On steroids. And I absolutely love it! I
    knew about its existence even before owning a Mac, and I envied Mac users to have
    such a great launcher. I used <a href="https://www.launchy.net/">Launchy</a> on
    Windows and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Do">GNOME Do</a> on Linux,
    and they are both great (just having a launcher will make you feel much more productive).</p><p>So
    when I got my Mac, one of the first things I did was to replace Spotlight with
    Alfred. Even without the PowerPack, it’s much more powerful than Spotlight. But
    the PowerPack (a paid extension) is where it really packs a punch. It enables
    a few more features like a text expansion (here called “snippets”) or the clipboard
    history. But the best features that come with the Powerpack are the “Alfred Workflows”
    — user-defined scripts that let you automate many tasks. I have a bunch of workflows
    to quickly create reminders, to-do tasks, temporary emails, convert currency,
    or search for emoji and Unicode characters.</p><p>There is already version 4 of
    Alfred, but I still haven’t upgraded from version 3.</p><h3>My Alfred workflows</h3><p>Here
    are some of the workflows that I’m using with Alfred:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/moranje/alfred-workflow-todoist">Alfred
    Workflow Todoist</a> — lets me quickly add tasks to Todoist</p></li><li><p><a
    href="http://www.packal.org/workflow/convert">Convert</a> — convert from one unit

    alt=""></p><p>Magnet is a window manager. It’s unbelievable that Mac still doesn’t
    have a built-in window manager that supports keyboard shortcuts. Luckily, Magnet
    fills this gap (for a price of a few $). By default, it uses ⌃+⌥ as a modifier,
    which conflicts with a lot of my VS Code settings (I’m using ⌃+⌥ as a modifier
    for all my custom shortcuts). So I changed it to ⌘+⌥+⌃. It sounds like a lot of
    keys to press simultaneously, but I mapped all 3 of them to 1 key using Karabiner-Elements
    (mentioned below).</p><p>If you prefer a free alternative, there is also <a href="https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle">Rectangle</a>
    — a successor of the <a href="https://www.spectacleapp.com/">discontinued Spectacle
    app</a>. I started using Magnet because Spectacle didn’t have some shortcuts (like
    “Split into 1/3 of the screen”). But Rectangle has even more options than Magnet,
    so it looks like an excellent replacement.</p><p>If you miss a tiling window manager,
    there is also <a href="https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst">Amethyst</a>. I tried
    it, but it didn’t feel as good as i3, so I didn’t stick with it. It was missing
    the basic functionality, like moving into a specific direction with a modifier
    + arrow key.</p><h3><a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a></h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/0*K8_zQ9iu49E7z0q0.jpg"

    I’ve tested all of them), and I was always coming back to Todoist. I like it for
    its clean interface, the “Next 7 days” view, and the ability to use special shortcuts
    when creating tasks. For example, if I add a task: “Write a blog post tod p1 #blog”
    it will create a “Write a blog post” task, set due date to today, add “Priority
    1” flag, and assign it to a project called “Blog.” Neat!</p><h3><a href="https://dozermac.com/">Dozer</a></h3><p>This

    It lets me hide those items that I’m not using very often. And with a keyboard
    shortcut, I can quickly show/hide them. If you need more features, there is also
    a paid app called <a href="https://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender</a>, but Dozer

    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/0*lKtlh6CKququ-eC0.jpg" alt=""></p><p>BetterTouchTool
    (or BTT for short) lets you customize any input device for your Mac. You can create
    custom Trackpad or Magic Mouse gestures, custom keyboard shortcuts, and macros
    (sequences of keys). It comes with a clipboard manager and window manager. It
    could replace a bunch of other tools that I’m using.</p><p>But none of those features
    are the reason why I decided to pay $10 for this app. I bought it so I can customize
    my Macbook’s touch bar. In its original form, the touch bar was unusable for me.
    Buttons that change depending on which application you are using is one of the
    worst ideas ever. I don’t want to rediscover what’s on the touch bar each time
    I change the currently used app. And half of the buttons are useless anyway. I
    don’t want a slider for the volume or brightness! 99% of the time, I only need
    to increase or decrease it by a notch. I should be able to do this with one press
    of a button. So, as most of the people that I know, I didn’t even use the touch
    bar. And one day, I stumbled upon an article on HackerNews that was explaining
    <a href="http://vas3k.com/blog/touchbar/">how to make the touch bar actually useful</a>.
    After reading this article, I immediately bought the BTT.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/0*CGqSMGO_H-plGhh_.jpg"
    alt=""></p><p>Now on my touch bar, there are (from left to right):</p><ul><li><p>Esc
    button (that I don’t really use, but you can’t remove it).</p></li><li><p>A special
    button that will switch the touch bar back to the default, crappy Mac version
    (again, it’s there by default, and I don’t use it).</p></li><li><p>Buttons that
    open (or switch to) the Calendar, Mail, Todoist, and Toggl apps. I use them from
    time to time (mostly when I’m working with Macbook on my laps, otherwise it’s
    faster for me to switch with the keyboard).</p></li><li><p>A script that shows
    the currently playing song from Spotify or Youtube. It’s only visible when one
    of those apps is open. If I press the name of the song, it will skip to the next
    one. Best button! Ever!</p></li><li><p>Play/Pause button for Spotify/Youtube.</p></li><li><p>Brightness
    down and up buttons.</p></li><li><p>Volume down, up, and mute buttons.</p></li></ul><p>There
    is a ton of other widgets that you can use — weather, temperature, time and date,
    custom shell, or Apple Scripts. The BTT author has added a lot of new ones since
    I set up my touch bar, so I will have to revise it at some point.</p><h3><a href="https://meetfranz.com/">Franz</a></h3><p><img

    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/0*LFsRTa0BGsoJtPTO.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Karabiner-Elements
    is a free app to customize your keyboard (it has a lot of duplication with BetterTouchTool).
    You can swap keys, change the behavior of function keys, or define some complex
    macros. I use it for three things:</p><ul><li><p>I have swapped the Caps Lock
    and Esc keys (and I can’t believe how I could live before doing it). Luckily,
    I discover this trick before I switched to Macbook with its useless Esc key on
    the touch bar.</p></li><li><p>Since I’m using <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/">Kinesis
    Advantage 2 keyboard</a>, I have remapped the Home key to ⌃(Ctrl) and End to a
    combination of ⌘+⌥+⌃ (which is a modifier that I use for window management with
    Magnet). This combination (often with the addition of Shift) is called the <a
    href="https://statusq.org/archives/2016/09/25/7857/">“Hyper” key</a>, and it gives
    you another modifier key to use with your shortcuts. Just in case having three
    modifier keys on Mac is not enough.If you are using a <em>“normal”</em> keyboard,
    I saw people mapping “pressing Ctrl” to act like the Esc key and “holding Ctrl”
    to act like the Ctrl key. Which is pretty smart, since we never just press Ctrl
    — it’s always used in combination with other keys. This will free up the “Esc”
    (or “Caps Lock” if you followed my previous advice and swapped them) for your
    Hyper key or any kind of crazy combination that you can think of.</p></li><li><p>A
    careful reader might notice that I no longer have a way to enable the Caps Lock.
    The “Caps Lock” key is now my Esc, and Macbook doesn’t let you redefine the “Esc”
    key on the touch bar. So I have 2 Esc keys and no Caps Lock. Which is bad — how
    am I supposed to argue with people on the Internet without the Caps Lock? Luckily,
    there was a solution for that — I mapped pressing <strong>both Shift</strong>
    keys simultaneously to Caps Lock. It sounds crazy, but it’s actually quite intuitive
    and easy to remember. I have no idea why it’s not a default behavior. To make
    it work, I had to modify the Karabiner-Elements config file directly. You can
    <a href="https://github.com/switowski/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json#L41">check
    my dotfiles repository</a> to see how to do this. Just remove the stuff that you
    don’t need and put this karabiner.json in your <em>~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json</em>
    file.</p></li></ul><h3><a href="https://fishshell.com/">Fish</a></h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2902/0*Cod7RCGlW4zet2T1.jpg"
    alt=""></p><p>When I first started using Linux, I used Bash. Then I switched to
    Z shell. With oh-my-zsh. Then I realized that it’s becoming a bit sluggish, mostly
    during the startup time. I decided that I don’t have time to sit down and stare
    at my screen for almost 2 seconds waiting for it to load. So I switched to prezto
    when it was a cool, new thing (and not an <a href="https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/issues/1239">abandoned
    package as it is today</a>). In 2017 I switched to a Macbook. Which was a great
    opportunity to try something new! Some of my colleagues at work were using fish
    at that time, and it looked interesting. It had some neat features out of the
    box, like the autosuggestions, syntax highlighting, or switching between directories
    using ⌥+→ and ⌥+←. So I tried it. And I liked it, so I’m still using it today.
    I use <a href="https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher">fisher</a> package manager
    with a few plugins (there is also oh-my-fish, but fisher was supposed to be faster,
    so I stick to it). I try to avoid adding too many plugins to make the terminal
    startup faster (I’m starting a bunch of terminal sessions on an average day, so
    those seconds add up).</p><h3><a href="http://captin.mystrikingly.com/">Captin</a></h3><p><img

    is a spaced repetition app. For most of my life I thought that I was stupid because
    I had terrible problems with memorizing things. It turns out that I was using
    the wrong technique. Spaced repetition is a simple mechanism that makes sure that
    you don’t repeat things that you already remember, but only those things that
    you have problems remembering. I’m using Anki purely on my phone, but adding new
    words is much easier to do on a computer.</p><p>Also, Anki is not only useful
    for learning new languages (although I’m using it right now for learning Japanese)!
    I’ve met someone who started working on a very complicated software project a
    few months ago. There were so many parts of the system that it would take him
    (and every new person on the team) a long time to learn how they all work. So
    he started creating flashcards with Anki describing various parts of the system
    and how to use them. Soon, other people from his team started using Anki as well,
    saying that it’s much better than reading pages and pages of documentation!</p><h3><a

    take a screenshot of the whole desktop, just a part of it, or even choose some
    options, like a delayed screenshot, if you want a screenshot of a hover effect
    on a website. Then you can open the screenshot, put some arrows or text, and send
    it to someone. So that worked for me for a long time. Until I found Skitch. With
    Skitch, when you take a screenshot, it automatically opens a simple app with some
    default tools for annotating them. It has huge pink arrows, large text, etc. When
    you finish, you can just drag and drop the screenshot from the app to a chat window.
    No more opening the Finder to find the screenshot, no more adjusting the text
    size and color in Preview app or clumsy arrows that you make from 3 straight lines
    glued together. With Skitch, I can take a screenshot, annotate the problem and
    send it to someone on a Slack in less than 10 seconds.</p><p>The only downside
    is that Sketch’s keyboard shortcuts are non-customizable and the conflict with

    of tools that probably everyone knows, but to keep this list complete, here they
    are:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> — a note-taking
    app that doesn’t need an introduction. It doesn’t get much love nowadays, but
    I never actually moved away from it. The free plan is still perfectly fine for
    me.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> — THE version control
    tool.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> — I use vim mostly
    for quick edits (small files or notes that don’t require a full-fledged IDE).</p></li><li><p><a
    href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC</a> — video player. I used
    it on all my Mac, Windows, and Linux computers.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>
    — I should probably learn how to use one of those hip, beautiful (and expensive)
    Mac apps for editing images. But I’m too lazy, and I know GIMP for years, so it’s
    fine for now.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> —
    my preferred file synchronization tool.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://iterm2.com/">iterm2</a>
    — <em>de facto</em> terminal app for Mac. It works great, stores its configuration
    nicely in my Dropbox backup folder, and I’m not planning to change it to anything
    else any time soon.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>
    — even though I have not used it in ages, it’s my go-to virtualization tool. Back
    in the days, when I was still using Windows at home, VirtualBox was a great tool
    to easily spin up Linux containers, so I could actually do some programming (this
    was before Windows 10 with all the programming goodies).</p></li><li><p>dotfiles.
    I’m a big fan of dotfiles, and while there are some great tools to manage them
    (like <a href="https://yadm.io/">yadm</a> or <a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/">dotbot</a>),
    I’ve always used some bash scripts to manage them. I try to keep them up to date,
    so in case of a laptop failure, I can switch to a new one with all my settings
    and software. You can find my dotfiles <a href="https://github.com/switowski/dotfiles">here</a>.If

    preserve the configuration of your software, there is also <a href="https://github.com/lra/mackup">mackup</a>.

    (it supports <a href="https://github.com/lra/mackup#supported-applications">over
    450 applications</a>) into a folder in Dropbox, iCloud, or a similar service.
    Plus, it will replace the configuration files with symlinks to the backup location
    so that they will be automatically backed up. And with just one command, you can
    recover it on a different machine.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/">Docker
    for Mac</a> — Mac client for Docker. Before I had a Mac, I was jealous of the
    beautiful Docker interface with the Kitematic app that Mac users had. Downloading
    images, listing running containers, or executing commands inside them through
    a nice GUI sounded like a sweet option. By the time I switched to a Mac, I already
    knew how to use Docker enough that I was doing all those things comfortably in
    the terminal. So I actually never used the GUI (but if you are a <em>“GUI person”</em>,
    I’m sure you are going to love it!).To make it even worse, Docker for Mac has
    a <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3232">memory leaks problem</a>.
    It’s something that has been reported already in 2018 and closed because <em>“It’s
    a problem with Mac not with Docker.”</em> Even though people are still regularly
    commenting that they have this issue. Even with stopped containers, after running
    for a while, Docker starts consuming quite a lot of memory (and its energy consumption
    is high, so I usually disable it when I’m on a battery).</p></li></ul><h2>Tools
    that I don’t use, but I can highly recommend</h2><p>Finally, there are some great
    tools that I currently don’t use. Some of them are the tools that I used in the
    past. And for some of them, I still haven’t found a good use case:</p><ul><li><p><a
    href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a> — I’ve tried to use this terminal
    multiplexer a few times. But I never stuck to it. It’s easy to define shortcuts
    in iterm2 to split terminals and move withing them, so I don’t really need a separate
    tool for this. I also don’t need to keep my terminal sessions running for ages.
    If a terminal <em>dies</em>, it’s fine — I just start a new one. The obvious reason
    to use tmux is when you regularly connect to multiple servers. Which I no longer
    do. With Docker and the whole CI/CD movement, I realized that I less and less
    have to SSH anywhere. I work on my local machine, push my code to GitHub/GitLab,
    and the machines take over from there.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://getbitbar.com/">BitBar</a>
    — a great little app that lets you put the output from any script or program in
    your menu bar. CPU usage graphs? Checked. Little menulet to interact with MySQL?
    Docker status? Bitcoin price? Ten different battery level indicators or your Apple
    keyboard battery level indicator? All checked! The only reason why I don’t use
    it is — I don’t need any of those scripts for now. I only needed to show the RAM
    and CPU graphs, but unfortunately, there were no RAM graph plugins when I checked,
    so I installed <a href="https://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/MenuMetersElCapitan/">MenuMeters</a>
    instead.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12">Amphetamine</a>
    — prevents your Macbook from going to sleep. Good tool when you are giving presentations.</p></li><li><p><a
    href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a> — a great tool to access the documentation.
    Supports probably every programming language ever invented, works offline, and
    you can even search directly on StackOverflow. But for some reason, I never actually
    get used to it.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flycut-clipboard-manager/id442160987?mt=12">Flycut</a>
    a clipboard manager that I used for some time before switching to Alfred. It’s
    free.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> —
    I’ve used it as my default programming editor for years. Then I switched to VS
    Code. I still keep Sublime Text to quickly preview and edit large files (although
    I use vim more and more for this).</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/dteoh/SlowQuitApps">Slow
    Quit Apps</a> — it’s frustrating when I accidentally press ⌘+Q instead of ⌘+W,
    and I close the current app. Slow Quit App prevents this by adding a time threshold.
    By default, you need to keep pressing ⌘+Q for 1 second to actually close an app.
    I would probably use it if I knew about it before, but since I didn’t, I decided
    to remap ⌘+Q to some useless command. So now it’s “inverting colors.”</p></li><li><p><a
    href="https://mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/">CheatSheet</a> — I was really excited
    when I found this small helper. When you install it, each time you hold the ⌘
    key, it will display an overlay with shortcuts for the current application. But
    then I realized that I don’t really use it, so I uninstalled it.</p></li></ul><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>I
    learned about most of those tools from my colleagues, browsing through dotfiles
    of other people, and reading posts on HackerNews. Without other people sharing
    their tools, I would probably still be using Nano. So I hope that someone will

    it comes to being a good programmer, there are certain habits that immediately
    pop up in your mind. There are some habits that most programmers would agree are
    great to have, but in reality, most of them don’t have these habits themselves.</p><p>As
    we all know, we are defined by our habits. To become a better programmer, we should
    try to build great programming habits.</p><p>Here are six great programming habits
    that you should try to build to stand out from the pack.</p><h2>1. Clean Up Your
    Code</h2><p>A great programming habit is that whenever you change a piece of code,
    you should try to improve that code — it doesn’t matter whether you’re just fixing
    one line of code or adding an entirely new feature to the existing code.</p><p>Robert
    C. Martin had a great quote for this habit that was based on the Boy Scout Rule:</p><blockquote><h1>“Always
    leave the code you’re editing better than you found it.”</h1></blockquote><p>You’ll
    be amazed by how many small things you can improve while reading through some
    code. The changes that you make can be as small as renaming a variable or function.
    Just make sure to do at least one improvement at a time. You’ll leave the code
    in much better shape and heavily reduce the number of code smells.</p><p>The reason
    why this is such a good habit to have is that we learn constantly. Things that
    were considered to be good* *yesterday can be done better in some other way today.
    Code tends to rot over time, so taking care of your code is essential to keep
    it maintainable.</p><h2>2. Think About Who’s Next</h2><p>Whenever you’re writing
    a piece of code, you should think about what the next developer is going to find
    when looking at that piece of code.</p><p>Write that piece of code with the mentality
    to make it easily understandable and as readable as you can. The ratio of time
    spent reading code versus writing code is well over 10-to-1. This means that you
    can save a lot of time in the long run by putting in a little more effort into
    making your code readable.</p><p>Don’t try to be fancy when it comes to coding
    — write simple code that everyone can understand. There’s really no need to do
    some magic one-liners that you’ve copied from Stack Overflow that you don’t even
    really understand yourself.</p><h2>3. Do What’s Needed — Not More Than That</h2><p>Developers
    tend to have the weird habit of overdoing things. When a certain feature is requested
    most developers will build something extra “just in case.”</p><p>This is what
    we call <em>overengineering</em>, which is the art of overdoing things. Code is
    made more robust or complicated than necessary. The thing with overengineering
    is there’s no good reason for doing it.</p><p>Most of the time, the reason that
    more gets built than what is really necessary is based on speculation. The developer
    is already adding code that might be helpful in the future, based on their own
    thoughts. This additional piece of code gets added to the codebase, but it probably
    never gets used.</p><p>Overengineering can lead to code that is being designed
    to be so generic that it loses sight of the main task that it was initially designed
    to perform. Therefore it becomes not only hard to use but fundamentally unintelligible.</p><h2>4.
    Plan Your Code</h2><p>Real programmers love to do one thing and one thing only,
    and that’s programming. That shouldn’t really shock you. So the obvious thing
    that happens is that most programmers jump straight into the part that they love
    the most when they get assigned a certain task.</p><p>They start coding immediately.</p><p>Rushing
    into the code might seem exciting at first. However, that excitement might end
    up costing you a lot of time. When jumping straight into the coding part, you’ll
    eventually lose sight of the bigger picture.</p><p>Before you start coding, you
    need to plan and organize. Think about problems that you might find along the
    way and how can you tackle them. How will you structure your code? What’s the
    reason that you’re going to implement this feature?</p><p>These are all great
    questions to ask yourself before you start coding. These questions can make you
    more aware of the fact that there’s a lot to think about before writing code.</p><h2>5.
    Document</h2><p>Yes, I know… Definitely not the fanciest habit on this list but
    a great one to have. Documenting your work is extremely important.</p><p>Did you
    ever have to check out a repository that didn’t have any documentation about how
    to set up everything properly or how the application was supposed to work?</p><p>After
    reading through the code for a couple of hours, chances are that you still didn’t
    have a clue. That’s when you wished for some documentation.</p><p>As a bare minimum,
    I would recommend a proper readme.md for your projects that explains what the
    application is supposed to do and how you can get it up and running.</p><p>The
    exciting part about documentation is that you could do it while coding. Take some
    time to think about descriptive variable names — this will pay for itself. Choosing
    good names for your variables, methods, and classes takes time, but it saves more
    time than it takes.</p><p>If you want to read more about how you can create meaningful
    names in your code, read <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-create-meaningful-names-in-code-20d7476537d4">this
    article</a> that I’ve written.</p><h2>6. Never Stop Learning</h2><p>As Isaac Asimov
    said, “The day you stop learning is the day you begin decaying.” This is especially
    true in the tech world, where things change at a rapid pace.</p><p>It’s impossible
    to keep up with everything that changes, and even if you could, I wouldn’t recommend
    it. Don’t take this to the extreme, but it’s good to learn a new framework or
    programming language every once in a while.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that you have
    to become an expert in all of these programming languages or frameworks. It’s
    good to experiment with some of them and see whether you like them.</p><p>You’ll
    gain a lot of new insights into how certain problems are solved in other programming
    languages or frameworks that will help you grow as a programmer.</p><h2>Wrapping
    It Up</h2><p>When it comes to being able to distinguish yourself as a programmer,
    there are numerous habits that you could build. We’ve gone over six of these habits
    that the majority of developers don’t have.</p><p>These are the habits that will
    make you stand out:</p><ul><li><p>Clean up your code</p></li><li><p>Think about
    the next person who has to look at your work</p></li><li><p>Don’t do more than
    needed</p></li><li><p>Plan your code</p></li><li><p>Document your work</p></li><li><p>Never
    stop learning</p></li></ul><p>Try building these habits for yourself, one at a
    time. Remember that it takes time and consistency to build them — it won’t happen
    overnight.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>

  :title: What programming language has the happiest developers?
  :content: '<p>There are a lot of stereotypes in the IT world, like “PHP is the worst
    language” or that “Python is for beginners”. Thankfully, we can find the truth
    using github and data from developer surveys.</p><h3>Data acquisition</h3><p>Github
    is a platform familiar to any developer. Not only can it be used as a versioning
    tool, but also to gather repository and project statistics, user profile data
    and comments. That way we can access the information about age, gender and profile
    photos. Microsoft Face API is just the right tool for the job.</p><p>Github provides
    a list of the 25 most popular repositories and displays top 5 contributors. Eigencoder
    <a href="https://github.com/trestletech/eigencoder">app</a>, which I will be using,
    detects 30–80 profile photos from each repository and analyzes them.</p><h3>Gender</h3><p>The
    Face API has the ability to detect gender from facial structure. The results here
    are quite one sided. AI and Webdev languages have at least some female energy.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*_3_thVNlkQ-Dxx8gkGhF5Q.jpeg" alt=""></p><h3>Age</h3><p>The
    age metric turned out to be interesting. Older languages should be presumably
    used by older programmers, but *Java *has the youngest devs.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*zRrgaS-gRVC0Zq0ILDf8jA.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><h3>Smiles</h3><p>Every programmer has a language he doesn’t like,
    so much so he can’t even smile for his profile photo. Face API measures the amount
    that you are smiling, using a value between 0 and 1.</p><p>It looks like R developers
    are the happiest, followed closely by Go, C# and Python. Java devs, on the other
    hand, don’t seem to be enjoying their craft.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*HSdkddBaAfIPRrH5ECTKpA.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><h2>Comments analysis</h2><p>Tobias Hermann analyses the comments and
    the words that developers of each respective<a href="https://github.com/Dobiasd/programming-language-subreddits-and-their-choice-of-words">
    *language subreddit</a> *use.</p><h3>Happiness</h3><p>Most positive are the Clojure,
    Lisp and Scala developers.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*GdPLGoeqly7gMXXW.png"
    alt=""></p><h3>Swearing</h3><p>You will hear the most swearwords among the PHP
    communities (that comes as a no surprise I think). Second “best” is Javascript,
    followed by Java on the third place. Mathematical language devs seem to be at
    ease the most.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*NheGJcDjk4hDVyKK.png"
    alt=""></p><h3>CodinGame 2020 Developer survey</h3><p>And like a small cherry
    on top I will look at the happiness levels of devs in each industry. TOP 3 according
    to the <a href="https://www.codingame.com/work/codingame-developer-survey-2020/">codingame</a>
    survey are:</p><ol><li><p>Data scientists/Machine learning specialists</p></li><li><p>Game
    developers/Engineers</p></li><li><p>Development teachers and academic researchers</p></li></ol><h3>To
    wrap up…</h3><p>The data analysis didn’t turn out very scientific results, but
    it can provide some level of insight. Languages like PHP, Html and R are used
    mainly by women, C and C++ then almost exclusively by men.</p><p>The C++ language
    has the oldest devs, whereas Java the youngest.</p><p>And the happiest seem to
    be those who use R, Go, C# and Python.</p><p>But of course.. the whole happiness
    and meaning you find in your job depends on your orientation in life, goals and
    aims. Someone could thrive in the machine learning industry, others prefer game
    development for the constant novelty and so on. Anyway, leave a comment if you
    feel like you are an exception in the statistics, and you are i.e. a young C++
    dev, I would love to see that!</p><p>See also: Post-mortem analysis of this article<a

  :title: Top 3 most popular programming languages in 2018 (and their annual salaries)
  :content: <p>Considering the extensive number of the modern <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/programming">programming</a>
    languages, deciding which one to take by its horns and master can be a strenuous
    task.</p><p>Before deciding on the ‘best’ language to go for, you should evaluate
    several factors, including your personal preferences and choices.</p><p><a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/bautistaaa/lm4jx-how-to-build-a-simple-slack-clone-in-firebase-and-angularjs/">Bautista</a>,
    who has more than four years of experience in web development and currently teaches
    people his skills, says that “one of the best ways to choose the right <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/programming-language">programming
    language</a> in 2018 for your use case is to study what is taking place in the
    technology industry.”</p><p>The industry will give you important trends and signals
    you can use to arrive at your decisions. For example, if you know the programming
    languages that make the most money in 2018 or are the most popular in 2018, you
    can suitably adjust the sails to focus on them.</p><p>In this post, we are going
    to evaluate some sources with the intention of coming up with the top three most
    in demand programming languages 2018.</p><p><strong>1. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/javacript">JavaScript</a></strong></p><p>JavaScript
    is a dynamic programming language that is mostly used for adding interactivity
    on websites.</p><p>It’s usually painted as “beginner friendly,” something which
    has enhanced its increased usage in the developer community.</p><p>Stack Overflow,
    a popular website that developers use to share their skills, usually does a yearly
    survey to get useful statistics from the developer community — from their salaries
    to favorite technologies.</p><p>In January 2018, the website surveyed more than
    100,000 developers and revealed some interesting statistics.</p><p>Here is the
    <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#most-popular-technologies">Stack
    Overflow chart</a> that categorizes the programming languages according to their
    popularity:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*-hcKuuxiLLijVCaX"
    alt=""></p><p>As you can see above, the survey revealed that JavaScript is the
    top programming language 2018, at 69.8% — for the sixth consecutive year.</p><p>GitHub,
    the code-sharing website used by millions of developers from around the world,
    also mentions that JavaScript is the most commonly used programming language.
    In a report at the end of 2017, <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">GitHub</a>
    stated that most of its users rely on JavaScript for their repositories.</p><p>Here
    is the GitHub chart showing the popularity of the programming languages:</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*wyH0Qr8K1HIePqhR" alt=""></p><p>Globally,
    the Stack Overflow survey found out that JavaScript developers make about $55,000
    per year. However, developers using the language in the U.S. earn about $98,000
    per year.</p><p><a href="https://www.indeed.com/salaries/Javascript-Developer-Salaries">Indeed.com</a>,
    a popular employment search website, estimates that a JavaScript developer in
    the U.S. takes home an average of $110,945 per year.</p><p><strong>2. Java</strong></p><p>Java
    is a versatile general-purpose programming language that is used to create cross-platform
    applications. Regardless of the platform you want to use for deployment — desktop,
    mobile, or web — Java will meet your needs.</p><p>The TIOBE Programming Community
    Index, which gauges the popularity of the programming languages based on the search
    engine results, places Java as the most popular language, as of July 2018.</p><p>Here
    is a chart of the TIOBE index:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*i2jUcZTIL7eQw_BA"
    alt=""></p><p>According to the Stack Overflow survey, Java’s popularity stands
    at 45.3%, which is the second-best (if HTML, CSS, SQL are not considered — which
    are mainly non-standalone, supportive languages to the main languages).</p><p>In
    the U.S., the survey found out that Java developers make about $100,000 per year.
    Similarly, <a href="https://www.indeed.com/salaries/Java-Developer-Salaries">Indeed.com</a>
    estimates that a U.S.-based Java developer makes an average of $100,873 per year.</p><p><strong>3.
    Python</strong></p><p>Python is a powerful high-level programming language that
    is gaining immense popularity in 2018. Because of its general-purpose nature,
    it’s extensively used for a wide range of tasks, including web development, machine
    learning, and analyzing data.</p><p>Stack Overflow found out that 38.8% of its
    users mainly use Python for their projects. According to the website’s survey,
    Python’s popularity surpassed that of C# in 2018 — just like it surpassed PHP
    in 2017.</p><p>On the GitHub platform, Python surpassed Java as the second-most
    used programming language, with 40% more pull requests opened in 2017 than in
    2016.</p><p>Worth mentioning, the continued interest in the field of artificial
    intelligence could be fueling the demand for Python. In fact, Stack Overflow calls
    it the “<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/?_ga=2.199625454.1908037254.1532442133-221121599.1532442133">fastest
    growing</a> major programming language.”</p><p>Here is a chart showing the incredible
    growth of Python:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*5sXl34xnPk7LW6YP"
    alt=""></p><p>Globally, the Stack Overflow survey found out that Python developers
    make about $56,000 per year. In the U.S., <a href="https://www.indeed.com/salaries/Python-Developer-Salaries">Indeed.com</a>
    estimates that they make an average of $114,811 per year.</p><p><strong>Wrapping
    up</strong></p><p>JavaScript, Java, and Python are evidently the best programming
    languages to learn for jobs in 2018.</p><p>Although the survey reports may differ
    slightly, the three top ranked programming languages are <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/projects/premium/programming/">worth
    learning</a> and including in your developer’s toolbox, especially if you want
    to take your career to the next level.</p><p>You can use this information about
    the most popular programming languages 2018 to assess whether your programming
    skills are aligned with the industry trends and the language you can use when
    starting to build a new software system, especially if you intend to collaborate
    with other developers.</p><p>Which programming language do you like using? Why?</p><p>Please

  :title: 7 Practical Tips for Cheating at Design
  :content: '<p>Improving your designs with tactics instead of talent.</p><p>Every
    web developer inevitably runs into situations where they need to make visual design
    decisions, whether they like it or not.</p><p>Maybe the company you work for doesn’t
    have a full-time designer and you need to implement the UI for a new feature on
    your own. Or maybe you’re hacking on a side-project and you want it to look better
    than <em>yet-another-Bootstrap-site.</em></p><p>It’s easy to throw your hands
    up and say,* “I’ll never be able to make this look good, I’m not an artist!”*
    but it turns out there are a ton of tricks you can use to level up your work that
    don’t require a background in graphic design.</p><p>Here are seven simple ideas
    you can use to improve your designs today<em>.</em></p><h2>1. Use color and weight
    to create hierarchy instead of size</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4590/1*KYZikUrx9F02cJU9kpn_gQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>A common mistake when styling UI text is relying too much on font
    size to control your hierarchy.</p><p><em>“Is this text important? Let’s make
    it bigger.”</em></p><p><em>“Is this text secondary? Let’s make it smaller.”</em></p><p>Instead
    of leaving all of the heavy lifting to font size alone, <strong>try using color
    or font weight to do the same job</strong>.</p><p><em>“Is this text important?
    *</em>Let’s make it bolder.*<em>”</em></p><p><em>“Is this text secondary? *</em>Let’s
    use a lighter color.*<em>”</em></p><p>Try and stick to two or three colors:</p><ul><li><p>A
    dark (<a href="https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/">but not
    black</a>) color for primary content <em>(like the headline of an article)</em></p></li><li><p>A
    grey for secondary content <em>(like the date an article was published)</em></p></li><li><p>A
    lighter grey for ancillary content <em>(maybe the copyright notice in a footer)</em></p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3150/1*2YuCOOCjdMEJxg-Lb6G2FA.png" alt=""></p><p>Similarly,
    two font weights is usually enough for UI work:</p><ul><li><p>A normal font weight
    <em>(400 or 500 depending on the font)</em> for most text</p></li><li><p>A heavier
    font weight <em>(600 or 700)</em> for text you want to emphasize</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3150/1*AHrVF0vTtj-yoyhmBNHNLA.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Stay
    away from font weights under 400 for UI work</strong>; they can work for large
    headings but are too hard to read at smaller sizes. If you’re considering using
    a lighter weight to de-emphasize some text, use a lighter color or smaller font
    size instead.</p><h2>2. Don’t use grey text on colored backgrounds</h2><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3150/1*ajjrhpp-l3GDG7ne7Am8fw.png" alt=""></p><p>Making
    text a lighter grey is a great way to de-emphasize it on white backgrounds, but
    it doesn’t look so great on colored backgrounds.</p><p>That’s because the effect
    we’re actually seeing with grey on white is <em>reduced contrast</em>.</p><p><strong>Making
    the text closer to the background color is what actually helps create hierarchy</strong>,
    not making it light grey.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3150/1*CNaej5BrPr9lWTMAfllfdw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>There are two ways you can reduce contrast when working with colorful
    backgrounds:</p><h3>1. Reduce the opacity of white text</h3><p>Use white text
    and lower the opacity. This lets the background color bleed through a bit, de-emphasizing
    the text in a way that doesn’t clash with the background.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3150/1*OMntEW2V5jPXrZR6CjrBFQ.png"
    alt=""></p><h3><strong>2. Hand-pick a color that’s based on the background color</strong></h3><p>This
    works better than reducing the opacity when your background is an image or pattern,
    or when reducing the opacity makes the text feel too dull or washed out.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3150/1*d5Ft9yND08hTdmXgFTLQJw.png" alt=""></p><p>Choose
    a color that’s the same hue as the background, adjusting saturation and lightness
    until it looks right to you.</p><h2>3. Offset your shadows</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4590/1*LisFGBtYOvR-3cwFTzTDUw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Instead of using large blur and spread values to make box shadows
    more noticeable, add a vertical offset.</p><p>It looks a lot more natural because
    it simulates a light source shining down from above like we’re used to seeing
    in the real world.</p><p>This applies to inset shadows like you might use on wells
    or form inputs too:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3150/1*qWSsYovqBDKF87f1IVMHsQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>If you’re interested in learning more about shadow design, the <a
    href="https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/elevation-shadows.html">Material
    Design Guidelines</a> are a fantastic primer.</p><h2>4. Use fewer borders</h2><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4590/1*fNm6hXxnBvIcHGp9DQRdRQ.png" alt=""></p><p>When
    you need to create separation between two elements, try to resist immediately
    reaching for a border.</p><p>While borders are a great way to distinguish two
    elements from one another, they aren’t the <em>only</em> way, and using too many
    of them can make your design feel busy and cluttered.</p><p>The next time you
    find yourself reaching for a border, try one of these ideas instead:</p><h3>1.
    Use a box shadow</h3><p>Box shadows do a great job of outlining an element like
    a border would, but can be more subtle and accomplish the same goal without being
    as distracting.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3150/1*Pm5PyS0vZ65GuGu8erPRfA.png"
    alt=""></p><h3><strong>2. Use two different background colors</strong></h3><p>Giving
    adjacent elements slightly different background colors is usually all you need
    to create distinction between them. If you’re already using different background
    colors in addition to a border, try removing the border; you might not need it.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3150/1*9j89WYXMqsnb_A1v8heXaw.png" alt=""></p><h3>3.
    Add extra spacing</h3><p>What better way to create separation between elements
    than to simply increase the separation? Spacing things further apart is a great
    way to create distinction between groups of elements without introducing any new
    UI at all.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4200/1*7CEsoYdtFPjMBqpDB58HqQ.png"
    alt=""></p><h2>5. Don’t blow up icons that are meant to be small</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4590/1*57g05Gl-FjDtcCUtaPPOLw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>If you’re designing something that could use some large icons <em>(like
    maybe the “features” section of a landing page)</em>, you might instinctively
    grab a free icon set like <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a>
    or <a href="http://www.zondicons.com/">Zondicons</a> and bump up the size until
    they fit your needs.</p><p>They’re vector images after all, so the quality isn’t
    going to suffer if you increase the size right?</p><p>While it’s true that vector
    images won’t degrade in quality when you increase their size, <strong>icons that
    were drawn at 16–24px are never going to look very professional when you blow
    them up to 3x or 4x their intended size.</strong> They lack detail, and always
    feel disproportionately “chunky”.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4080/1*dJyk3SNvrxuTEuZa7fiY0g.png"
    alt=""></p><p>If small icons are all you’ve got, try enclosing them inside another
    shape and giving the shape a background color:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4080/1*Og6TmKmbZg7qauQymzhxBQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>This lets you keep the actual icon closer to its intended size,
    while still filling the larger space.</p><p>If you have the budget, you could
    also use a premium icon set designed to be used at larger sizes, like <a href="http://www.heroicons.com/">Heroicons</a>
    or <a href="https://useiconic.com/">Iconic</a>.</p><h2>6. Use accent borders to
    add color to a bland design</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4590/1*uwsVo34TWzKM91Gyqsh88Q.png"
    alt=""></p><p>If you’re not a graphic designer, how do you add that dash of visual
    flair to your UI that other designs get from beautiful photography or colorful
    illustrations?</p><p>One simple trick that can make a big difference is to add
    colorful accent borders to parts of your interface that would otherwise feel a
    bit bland.</p><p>For example, along the side of an alert message:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*jEivJuYRI3PbrGYVccKkHA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>…or to highlight active navigation items:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*7Pf5gu0r3uPi7W5vR9dcWQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>…or even across the top of your entire layout:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/1*YMrMBgjpbuTs_WqdbhymNg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>It doesn’t take any graphic design talent to add a colored rectangle
    to your UI, and it can go a long way towards making your site feel more “designed.”</p><p><em>Have
    a hard time picking colors? Try choosing from a constrained palette like <a href="https://dribbble.com/colors">Dribbble’s
    color search</a> to avoid feeling overwhelmed by the endless possibilities of
    a traditional color picker.</em></p><h2>7. Not every button needs a background
    color</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3060/1*SIfuJd-3ZFYyA_W1Nme1Yw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>When there are multiple actions a user can take on a page, it’s
    easy to fall into the trap of designing those actions based purely on semantics.</p><p>Frameworks
    like Bootstrap sort of encourage this by giving you a menu of semantic styles
    to choose from whenever you’re adding a new button:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3124/1*2xkDfSjvq7Xyb_ceInrMpw.png"
    alt=""></p><p><em>“Is this a positive action? Make the button green.”</em></p><p><em>“Does
    this delete data? Make the button red.”</em></p><p>Semantics are an important
    part of button design, but there’s a more important dimension that’s commonly
    forgotten: <strong><em>hierarchy.</em></strong></p><p>Every action on a page sits
    somewhere in a pyramid of importance. Most pages only have one true primary action,
    a couple of less important secondary actions, and a few seldom used tertiary actions.</p><p>When
    designing these actions,** it’s important to communicate their place in the hierarchy.**</p><ul><li><p><strong>Primary
    actions should be obvious.</strong> Solid, high contrast background colors work
    great here.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Secondary actions should be clear but not prominent.
    *</em>Outline styles or lower contrast background colors are great options.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tertiary
    actions should be discoverable but unobtrusive.</strong> Styling these actions
    like links is usually the best approach.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/1*_tq33tZkr3DZuZgP08Jcrw.png"
    alt=""></p><p><em>“What about destructive actions, shouldn’t they always be red?”</em></p><p>Not
    necessarily! If the destructive action isn’t the <em>primary</em> action on the
    page, it might be better to give it a secondary or tertiary button treatment.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/1*1CxYaUc6Bk-pTRXH5TQonw.png" alt=""></p><p>Save
    the big, red, and bold styling for when that negative action actually <em>is</em>
    the primary action in the interface, like in a confirmation dialog:</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/1*cuYcwjOO26sKHImHaY6yFA.png" alt=""></p><h2>Enjoy

  :title: Why Product Thinking is the next big thing in UX Design
  :content: '<p>Life’s too short to build something nobody wants…</p><p>When thinking
    of User Experience, we often think of a simple, beautiful, and easy to use feature-set
    of a product, that makes the user’s life easier. But as a matter of fact, features
    are merely a small, fragile part of the product. They are only a few of many thinkable
    solutions for a user’s problem the product tries to solve. Thinking in products
    means thinking in specific user’s problems, in jobs to be done, in goals, and
    in revenues.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2060/1*4PXWHQnm3UbmuKp_StqmWg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The core user experience is not a set of features; in fact, it is
    the job users hire the product for. Uber’s core user experience is to get a taxi
    easily at any time. The countdown, displaying when exactly the taxi will arrive,
    is a suitable feature that expands this experience. But Uber’s product works regardless
    of this feature. The countdown, on the other hand, cannot live without the product
    (the certainty to get a taxi easily at any time). There is a one-way interrelationship
    between feature and product: Features don’t work without the product. This is
    why designers should think in products first.</p><p><em>“Think in products, not
    in features”</em></p><h2>Uncover the jobs the product is hired for</h2><p>A product
    has a core user experience, which is basically the reason the product exists.
    It fulfills a need or solves a problem people have. By that, it becomes meaningful
    and provides a certain value. If the problem is non-existant, or the solution
    doesn’t fit to the problem, the product becomes meaningless and people won’t use
    the product; which in turn leads to the downfall of the product. Wrong solutions
    can be fixed, but non-existant problems aren’t adjustable at all. So, how can
    we be sure to tackle a real problem? Alas, we can‘t be 100% sure, but we can minimize
    the risk a lot by observing and talking to people. Hence, uncovering the problem
    and building solutions customers really want.</p><p><em>„It’s not the customer’s
    job to know what they want“</em> — Steve Jobs</p><p>Clay Christensen, for instance,
    once tried to improve the sales of milkshakes. He tried to make them sweeter,
    offered them in different tastes, and slightly increased the size of the cups.
    Nothing worked out, until he started observing the customers who bought milkshakes.
    He found out that the job the customers hired the milkshake for was in fact to
    make their morning car ride to work less boring. The big benefit a milkshake has
    is that it is a thick drink that lasts longer than any other drink and stuffs
    the stomach. This was the real problem; the customers had no idea about it. In
    the end Christensen came up with the solution to make the milkshake even thicker,
    which led to an increase in sales numbers. <a href="http://ipony.de/?p=3495%5D">http://ipony.de/?p=3495</a></p><p><em>„Fall
    in love with a problem, not a specific solution“</em> — Laura Javier</p><h2>Think
    in products and build the right features for the right people</h2><p>Thinking
    in products helps building successful features. By defining the problems the product
    tackles, it answers the question “why do we build this product?”. Defining the
    target audience “who has these problems?” and defining the solution “how are we
    doing this?” will give enough guidance to create a new feature. Setting up a goal
    will help to measure the success of this feature.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3480/1*iftlg0lnE417o6Q9l7CATg.png"
    alt=""></p><h3><strong>The Problem-Solution-Fit</strong></h3><p>Products become
    meaningful when the provided solution fits the uncovered problem. This solution
    describes the way how a problem will be solved. Thus, the problem-solution-fit
    defines the core user experience of a product. The concrete features are extending
    this experience and support the core experience, but they cannot replace it. Interaction
    Design and Visual Design can make a product beautiful, easy-to-use, delightful
    or make it stand out in the competition, though it can’t make the product meaningful.
    This is why a proper problem-solution-fit is so critical for the success of a
    product.</p><h3>The Product Definition</h3><p>When thinking in products, UX designers
    should be able to answer the following questions first: What problem do we solve?
    (User problem). For whom are we doing this? (Target audience). Why are we doing
    this? (Vision). How are we doing this (Strategy) and what do we want to achieve?
    (Goals). Only then it makes sense to think about what exactly we are doing (Features).</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4120/1*b-JlzTz6Mti8n5-BWTEq2Q.png" alt=""></p><h2><strong>The
    power of Product Thinking</strong></h2><p>Thinking in products gives designers
    the advantage of building the right features for the right people. It helps understanding
    the user experience of a product as a whole; not purely as Interaction- and Visual-
    Design of features. It makes sure designers tackle real user problems and herewith
    reduce the risk of building something nobody wants. It gives the power to make
    the right decisions whenever it comes to building features.</p><p><em>“Building
    features is easy, building the right features for the right people is challenging”</em></p><p>Product
    Thinking enables UX designers to ask the right questions, to build the right features
    and to communicate with stakeholders more efficiently. It enables designers to
    say „no“ and to be hesitant before adding new features. Whenever a new feature
    is requested or someone has an idea for a new product, designers are able to ask
    the right questions, before drawing wireframes or crafting fancy layouts: “Does
    it fit into the product?”–“Does it serve a real user problem?” –“Do people want
    or need it?–Let’s find out first!” This will keep the product slim and effective.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Thinking
    in products makes sure designers build the right features for the right people
    and tackle real problems people have. It empowers to make the right decisions
    and is the foundation of building successful products users want. Product Thinking
    establishes a fruitful relationship between Product Management and UX Design and
    therefore leads to stronger products. This is why Product Thinking is going to
    be the next big thing in UX Design.</p><p><em>Nikkel <a href="https://twitter.com/JAF_Designer">@JAF_Designer</a>

  :title: 10 cheat codes for designing User Interfaces
  :content: "<p>I’d probably assume that most of us started in UI design with the
    littlest knowledge or nothing at all. But even though the odds were against us
    at the start, we managed our way through numerous design books and articles to
    understand how colors, typography, layout etc works. I remember how it is established
    in us at Make Technology, a UX driven company, that Design can’t be simply explained
    by colors, shapes, and text. It is a process that has a “Why” behind it, that
    whenever we create a text bigger, add a shadow, or change the color, there has
    to be a reason of why things have to be.</p><p>Thus in this article, I’ll be sharing
    a list of things I’ve learned from different companies, designers, things I’ve
    learned in designing user interfaces, and new discoveries I found along the way:</p><p>**Disclaimer:
    The following “Don’t” samples provided doesn’t necessarily mean they’re wrong.
    It’s our basis of how we can improve from a good design solution to a much better
    one *\U0001F600</p><h2><strong>1. This text is important, make it bigger!</strong></h2><p>When
    faced with content that needs font hierarchy, making the text bigger to give emphasis
    and importance usually doesn’t solve the problem, just like the one below:</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*zeL3V5_Xjr0R6EweICq1YQ.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Font hierarchy is just not about small to big font sizes. It is
    about the <strong>right</strong> <strong><em>mix of size, weights, and colors
    that creates contrast. Bigger contrast, the better.</em></strong></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4096/1*yqVwmecQQmn6fB6yRjv94A.jpeg\"
    alt=\"Apologies if the photo comes in low res format ✌️\"><em>Apologies if the
    photo comes in low res format ✌️</em></p><h3>So how do I create better contrast?</h3><ul><li><p>Don’t
    use one kind of weight with different font sizes to create contrast and hierarchy.</p></li><li><p>Instead,
    use bolder and darker style for primary content, or smaller and lighter for secondary
    content (less important).</p></li><li><p>Create three kinds of text colors that
    varies from dark to light (see example below). Usually I use my base color as
    body text color.</p></li><li><p>Don’t be afraid to apply big font gaps to your
    items (i.e. 24px header, 16px body text, 10px meta etc). Bigger gap = better contrast.</p></li><li><p>Check
    out <a href=\"http://www.modularscale.com\">Modularscale</a> an online calculator
    you can use to create better font hierarchy.</p></li><li><p>Remember, contrast
    is = size + weight + color.</p></li><li><p>Lastly, make sure to check its contrast
    ratio. You can use this <a href=\"http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/\">calculator</a>
    to check its accessibility.</p></li></ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*J9cLqeIrNQ3j3FzQrMnxzg.png\"
    alt=\"from my base color, I move from darker for headlines to lighter for ancillary
    content.\"><em>from my base color, I move from darker for headlines to lighter
    for ancillary content.</em></p><h2>2. Don’t create multiple shades of black</h2><p>Don’t
    make your life difficult by moving your color picker up and down to produce different
    shades of black text over white background.</p><p>We all know that using black
    text color (#000) causes eye strains for readers, and so our solution is to create
    darker variants as an alternative. But instead of color picking 3 or more hex
    color values, we can use black with different opacity as a solution:</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3444/1*l0W8gs5yDqzWGEH0lwsBtw.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>In my example above, I used black as my primary color (#000) and
    decreased its opacity depending to where it will be applied (i.e. primary content,
    secondary content, etc)</p><p>***<em>Update (July 2020): *</em>This kind of tweak
    works best on a white background, so I would suggest utilizing different shades
    of black instead for it is more scalable than opacity \U0001F4AA\U0001F3FD (yes
    this is me contradicting my thoughts, cuz why not? we learn!!)*</p><h2>3. Do the
    math for understanding colors</h2><p>Most of us suck at picking the right color
    combinations, and whenever we see a design with a well orchestrated color palette,
    we question ourselves <em>“How the F they did it?”</em> (just like the one below):</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Wti5_ENOwQ0Vb6_YgKBmjw.png\"
    alt=\"[t](http://momoandsprits.com/selfservice-company-web-illustrations/)aken
    from momoandspirits\"><em><a href=\"http://momoandsprits.com/selfservice-company-web-illustrations/\">t</a>aken
    from momoandspirits</em></p><p>Until I learned that understanding colors is not
    just for those who have the gift of design since the beginning of time, that a
    simple addition and subtraction at Hue, Saturation, Brightness (HSB) will do the
    magic <em>(we will be using HSB for this formula instead of RGB)</em>. You can
    easily get rid of the boring white over colored backgrounds, and turn it into
    a Picasso work like the one below:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3016/1*0MEEXvT1nTVIxtFNDdXwlQ.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><h3>So where does the addition and subtraction in HSB comes in?</h3><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*6mow0PlBFMP0iBnG4dB34Q.jpeg\"
    alt=\"Two approaches for understanding colors\"><em>Two approaches for understanding
    colors</em></p><p>There are actually two approaches we can do, and as we can see,
    both options has the same base color #B9F4BC (circle background) but differs when
    it comes to Folder and Strip color. As we start, always remember that the first
    number corresponds to Hue, followed by Saturation and lastly, Brightness.</p><h3>Option
    A</h3><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5128/1*74tlybKnuD3QLq-GYOAYiA.png\"
    alt=\"Option A\"><em>Option A</em></p><p>In Option A, we can see that we kept
    the Hue value *<em>123 *</em>all through out the shapes (circle, folder, strip)
    while the Saturation and Brightness is where the change happens.</p><p>Now, as
    we focus on the Saturation of the base which is <strong>24 *<em>and its Brightness,
    *</em>96, *<em>both values changed when we created darker green for the Folder.
    From Saturation of *</em>24</strong> it became <strong>40 *<em>(increment of +16)
    and from Brightness of *</em>96</strong> it became <strong>82 *<em>(decrement
    of -14), which shows us that *</em>*a change in saturation whether incremental
    or decremental needs an inversely proportional adjustment to brightness, in order
    to create a good contrast (vice versa)</strong><em>. And the same thing happened
    in Strip, using the Folder’s Saturation and Brightness as base value, we moved
    from *</em>40** to <strong>44 *<em>(increment of +04), and decreased from *</em>82
    *<em>to *</em>75</strong> (decrement of -07) for Brightness.Thus, leads us to
    the formula:</p><blockquote><h1>Darker Value = Increment in Saturation is a decrement
    in Brightness</h1><h1>Lighter Value = Decrement in Saturation is an increment
    in Brightness</h1></blockquote><p>This formula helped me every time I’m in wonder
    of what right colors should I use on my designs. I learned that the best starting
    point is to have a base color, and from there, start the adjustments in Saturation
    and Brightnesswhile keeping the Hue value the same.</p><h3>Option B</h3><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5128/1*7Nb4p-N2E24q1xCTNwDZ8Q.png\"
    alt=\"Option B\"><em>Option B</em></p><p>In Option B, the same principle is still
    applied (the formula we had above) but the Hue values change. And the terminologies
    RGB and CMY which we used to pass by in various design materials, will now make
    sense for us.</p><p>RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue, while CMY is Cyan, Magenta,
    and Yellow. These terminologies haven’t made any importance for me when I first
    started, until I came across this discovery of using RGB and CMY for color combinations.</p><p>Now
    In Option B, if we want to have a darker variation of the base color, all we need
    to do is move our color picker to the direction where the nearest RGB is located
    in our color palette, or move it the direction of CMY for lighter variation. For
    example:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*dEL58mn2oo546s3oCG-C3Q.png\"
    alt=\"Color Picker\"><em>Color Picker</em></p><p>Since we want to create a darker
    variation of our base color #B9F4BC (circle background) which is to be applied
    in our Folder icon, we need to move our color picker to the direction where the
    nearest RGB is located (which is Blue in this case). But if we want to have a
    lighter version of our Folder, we will be moving our picker to the left, near
    CMY (in this case Yellow).</p><p>*<em>More often RGB leads to darker variation
    and CMY for lighter one</em></p><p>After moving the color picker to our desired
    variation, we now apply the formula in Option A, which results us to having this
    color combination:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*xFJji20nmU2k5NB1NjL05A.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2488/1*QPP5vQxaP18yKlMDckyDqA.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><blockquote><h1>Red, Green, Blue (RGB) + Option A formula = Darker
    variation</h1><h1>Cyan, Magenta, Yellow (CMY) + Option A formula = Lighter variation</h1></blockquote><h2>4.
    Use spacing to separate groups</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2208/1*kpIkcNoPiyCVgPwVoZgq6g.jpeg\"
    alt=\"Be a generous space giver\"><em>Be a generous space giver</em></p><p>Aside
    from adding a line between two groups to show separation, using a generous space
    between is a better and easier solution.</p><p>As what the Law of Proximity states:</p><blockquote><h1>Objects
    that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.</h1></blockquote><p>From
    my example above, my goal is create a separation between my title and its writer
    by using a large space gap between them which is 24px.</p><h2>5. Use colors to
    separate rows</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2488/1*lvdKMx2DuwQ8E1U3v23Wig.jpeg\"
    alt=\"Colors as separators\"><em>Colors as separators</em></p><p>Doing row interfaces
    could be boring at times to design, since it only requires duplicating the component
    for n times. But on the user side, reading them can be difficult specially if
    there’s no great distinction between one row to the other. Thus aside from using
    lines, adding color background in rows can be a lot helpful for users in reading,
    and also will be more enjoying to do for us designers \U0001F44D</p><h2>6. Multiply
    instead of Drop shadow text</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*Iby-zWJwGxdR0PFRl467Dw.jpeg\"
    alt=\"Header design\"><em>Header design</em></p><p>It’s quite challenging designing
    header components or adding text over an image specially if the image background
    will be dynamic (or can be changed from time to time).</p><p>Usually the common
    solution for text with dynamic image background is adding drop shadow, but it
    doesn’t help user’s readability. It adds more visual clutter around the letters
    and words because they fill up the spaces in between them.</p><p>For some, black/white
    color overlay is the solution which is a helpful hack for these kinds of designs.
    But recently, I’ve discovered about using Multiply as blend tool for a gradient
    fill.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3024/1*FeILhUoIzi2xxe3iVpjAiw.png\"
    alt=\"Specs for Multiply blend options\"><em>Specs for Multiply blend options</em></p><p>Doing
    it is much easier than creating a black background over the image and lessen its
    opacity. Also, having it grayed scale makes the other part of the image retain
    its natural color, and makes the part where the text is located a little bit darker,
    for text readability.</p><h2>7. Line Length</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2876/1*vkoWZ1l8BuhVH5kapAEMJg.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>The common thing most designers do is making the line length longer
    so that it may fit its container. But doing so, creates eye strain for our users
    unlike having a 45–65 characters per line which is the ideal.</p><p>If you ever
    came across the dilemma of making the length shorter to make it ideal but will
    result to a big white space at the right side like the one below:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2124/1*keGR7l-EGER0p03SupmYKA.png\"
    alt=\"with big white space at the right\"><em>with big white space at the right</em></p><p>Don’t
    hesitate to do so, and make the whole text column center aligned to its container,
    so that you can remove the white space.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2100/1*x-Bzz3RlnSVFVfXca71hIg.png\"
    alt=\"centered content\"><em>centered content</em></p><h2>8. Don’t reinvent the
    wheel</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2996/1*bShhh5jnPP8b5xVViXNT_g.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>What makes a design inconsistent is when it is not component based.
    It is when you came to realize that you’ve made 5 kinds of card interface, 10
    buttons, 5 heading title styles etc.</p><p>Before you start creating an interface
    for a specific content, try to look around your previously created designs, for
    you might see a pattern which you can recycle and use.</p><p>Instead of reinventing
    the wheel and create another card for an Art Group (example above), we can use
    the Article card and replace it with the Art Group’s content. This will save time
    for designers and also make the interface consistent.</p><h2>9. Use brand colors
    as accents</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2796/1*m7dCpHin2HX9uN3LqlBVew.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>We usually think that branding colors must occupy a big chunk
    of our interface colors. We are having a hard time where to showcase our client’s
    shocking neon yellow, orange, and pink branding colors in our clean and minimalist
    layout. The answer? use them as accent colors.</p><h2>10. Hang the bullets</h2><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2208/1*X0mKGU-XpzbTOrkLhChHBw.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>And lastly if you are creating a list design like the one above,
    make the bullets, glyphs, or number sit in the margin to highlight the list. This
    will make the user readability flow uninterrupted and more legible.</p><p>There’s
    still a long list of design cheatsheets I would like to add, but for now I hope
    these 10 design tips will help you in creating design interfaces. Also, feel free

    principle of organization that every human should adhere to, particularly people
    who design products. Day after day, I see companies break this rule, and it is
    100% of the time to their detriment. In this article I will explain what that
    rule is, and what it means to product and service design. I’ll also raise the
    possible implications of this phenomenon on organizational management, collaboration,
    and general performance. The psychological phenomenon I will be discussing in
    this article is known as Miller’s Law. Rather than just tell you what Miller’s
    Law is, I ask you to take part in this exercise for a more immersive learning
    lesson.</p><h2><strong>The Exercise…</strong></h2><h3><strong>Step 1</strong></h3><p><em>Read
    the italicized instructions before starting. Grab a pen and paper. This is an
    exercise where you will try to recall words you’ve just read, off memory.</em></p><p><em>Below
    is a list of 20 words. Read them to comprehension , and try to memorize as many
    as possible. Try to keep the words ‘</em><em>in your head</em><em>’. Do *</em>not**
    write the words. Spend about a minute. After you are done reading, scroll down
    until you see the word ‘STOP’. Then, read step 2.*</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2912/1*7peyer3zYA0-CZcsAjyU9g@2x.png"
    alt=""></p><p><em>STOP &lt; ··············································</em></p><h3><strong>Step
    2</strong></h3><p><em>Now, use your pen and paper to write down as many words
    as you can remember from the list. Think hard, but *</em>do not scroll back up**
    to view the words. If you scroll up, the experiment is ruined. Give yourself about
    half a minute…Once you have finished writing the words you tried to recall, scroll
    back up and check how many you got right.*</p><p>If you are like the vast majority
    of human beings, you will have remembered 5–9 of the words. Hundreds of experiments
    prove universality of this limitation on memory. When I first discovered this
    phenomenon, I knew it had huge implications on product design, because of the
    degree to which this limitation affects day to day tasks. This capacity for keeping
    ~7 bits of information ‘in the head’ short term, is known as <em>Miller’s Law</em>.</p><h2><strong>Miller’s
    Law · The Magic Number</strong></h2><p>In 1956 there was a paper written that
    became one of the most highly cited papers in psychology. Titled, <em>The Magical
    Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information,</em>
    it was published in 1956 by the cognitive psychologist George A. Miller of Princeton
    University’s Department of Psychology in <em>Psychological Review</em>. The crux
    of the paper suggests that the number of perceptual ‘chunks’ an average human
    can hold in working memory (a component of short-term memory) is 7 ± 2. This is
    frequently referred to as <em>Miller’s law</em>. Here is a summary of the article,
    sourced from wikipedia:</p><blockquote><p>In his article, Miller discussed a coincidence
    between the limits of one-dimensional absolute judgment and the limits of short-term
    memory. In a one-dimensional absolute-judgment task, a person is presented with
    a number of stimuli that vary on one dimension (e.g., 10 different tones varying
    only in pitch) and responds to each stimulus with a corresponding response (learned
    before). Performance is nearly perfect up to five or six different stimuli but
    declines as the number of different stimuli is increased. The task can be described
    as one of information transmission: The input consists of one out of n possible
    stimuli, and the output consists of one out of nresponses. The information contained
    in the input can be determined by the number of binary decisions that need to
    be made to arrive at the selected stimulus, and the same holds for the response.
    Therefore, people’s maximum performance on one-dimensional absolute judgement
    can be characterized as an information channel capacity with approximately 2 to
    3 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bits</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information">information</a>,
    which corresponds to the ability to distinguish between four and eight alternatives.</p></blockquote><p>Moreover,
    the human mind can remember ~7 bits of information when completing a task that
    requires cognitive effort. This is critical, because humans are constantly performing
    tasks, and trying to juggle various stimuli in the mind when doing so. One of
    the key concepts behind Miller’s Law is ‘chunking’, which basically means assembling
    various bits of information into a cohesive gestalt. For example, the word · <em>p
    e n c i l</em> · is actually a ‘chunk’ of letters, organized into a perceptual
    gestalt. If the letters were rearranged · *c n l i p e · *it would be six separate
    chunks of information. Chunking is a critical element of information organization,
    and is the basis for our UX and organizational rule.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3606/1*PgZGGwR8UkLPnog2NcyliA@2x.png"
    alt=""></p><h2><strong>The Rule</strong></h2><p><em>Always organize elements of
    information in categories no larger than 9, but preferably ~5 chunks.</em></p><p>The
    more chunks of information you add to an ‘interface’, the more difficult it becomes
    to ‘work’, using the information at hand. This is <strong>especially critical
    for first time users, because they haven’t had the ‘practice’ needed to encode
    the interface into long term memory, or, for the behaviour to become habitual</strong>.
    I constantly see this rule being broken by giants like Facebook, Google, and Wordpress.
    Don’t even get me started on automobile interface design. The ~5 bit chunk rule
    also compliments minimalism as a rigorous design philosophy. To expound, due to
    the limitations of working memory, as a product becomes more feature-full it inevitably
    becomes more difficult to use, because the user has to manage more information
    while operating the product. This makes <strong>good</strong> information design
    so critical.</p><p>Millers Law also highlights the importance of foresight and
    proper planning in the design process, because as you add more features to a product
    — your interface must be able to accommodate those new features without breaking
    the visual foundation of what you built. Rebuilding a foundation takes immense
    time and resources.</p><p>Another perceptual phenomenon observed in relation to
    Miller’s Law is known as the <em>primacy</em>, and <em>recency effect</em>. These
    terms are used respectively to describe how we remember items sensed at the beginning
    and end of an experience, more than ones in the middle. For example, if I were
    to show you a list of words, you would more likely remember the words at the beginning
    of the list, and the end. This is also known as the <em>serial position effect</em>.
    From wikipedia:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Serial position effect</strong> is the
    tendency of a person to recall the first and last items in a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Search/series">series</a>
    best, and the middle items worst.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_position_effect#cite_note-1">[1]</a>
    The term was coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus">Hermann
    Ebbinghaus</a> through studies he performed on himself, and refers to the finding
    that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall">recall</a> accuracy
    varies as a function of an item’s position within a study list.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_position_effect#cite_note-Ebbinghaus-2">[2]</a>
    When asked to recall a list of items in any order (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_recall">free
    recall</a>), people tend to begin recall with the end of the list, recalling those
    items best (the <strong>recency effect</strong>). Among earlier list items, the
    first few items are recalled more frequently than the middle items (the <strong>primacy
    effect</strong>).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_position_effect#cite_note-3">[3]</a><a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_position_effect#cite_note-Murdock-4">[4]</a></p></blockquote><p>This
    observation raises huge questions in business and design. If people remember more
    at the beginning and end of an experience, how do we enhance the positives, and
    mitigate the negatives at these respective times? When does an experience truly
    begin and end? Should we be organizing more important elements at the beginning
    and end of lists due to their increased retention? These are all valid questions
    that UX designers and executives should ask when inventing or developing their
    product.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3604/1*n5o78Gu9qEh4J2ui2GY4Ig@2x.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Millers Law can be applied to any aspect of your life that involves
    performing a mildly complex task. By reducing the amount of elements in your reach/access
    — and keeping them organized by relevant chunks not exceeding 9 bits, your brain
    will be able to remember exactly <em>where</em> things are so you can access its
    functionality. When lists of items grow too large, they become very difficult
    to mentally map them, requiring the user to do more cumbersome searching.</p><p>The
    adherence to Miller’s Law is especially relevant in the light of lean methodologies
    and recent trends in tech and UX. Users want and need a trial before they purchase
    something — it’s that simple. If they don’t experience the value within the first
    day or week of using it — they won’t buy. Since new users do not have lengthly
    time to learn <em>where</em> everything is — information design needs to be planned
    and well thought out before development happens.</p><h2><strong>Millers Law Beyond
    Information</strong></h2><p>We live in a world with an exponentially increasing
    amount of information. By not organizing it <em>properly,</em> or eliminating
    some completely, it ultimately degrades our ability to complete critical tasks
    for the purposes of survival (navigation/gaining income). That is why it’s so
    useful to omit items, products, and services from your life that aren’t giving
    a quality return on investment. This falls in line with the <em>Pareto principle</em>,
    the idea that 80% of your outcomes comes from 20% of your investments. Are you
    juggling too many tasks per day to be efficient? Is your team using too many tools
    to collaborate? Do you have too many members on your team? Are you overloading
    your new employees with information, leading to confusion?</p><p>Millers law teaches
    us that humans have a finite amount of information they can process, and that
    information overload will lead to distraction that negatively affects performance.
    Companies should look for ways to organize information in a way that is much more
    digestible for their customers and employees. This could be by eliminating tools
    or applications that are producing cognitive overload, reducing the amount of
    members on a team, or even organizing your departments based on our knowledge
    of working memory.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4810/1*fKydAaHAho7Rkfs2Us-pVA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>This is especially true in new science of the concept of <em>flow,</em>
    made famous by* <em>psychologist</em> *Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. *Flow *is a word
    Mihaly coined to describe a state of concentration or ‘absorption’ with a specific
    task that humans ultimately find rewarding, pleasurable, and fulfilling. He describes
    it as an optimal state where we perform at our best and truly live ‘in the moment’.
    One sure way to kill flow is by increasing distractions in the workplace. So,
    do you think that by giving your employees more tools, that it actually enhances
    performance? Miller’s Law teaches us time and time again this is not the case.
    When it comes to completing tasks, less is more.</p><h3><strong>Actionable Insights</strong></h3><p>Turn

  :title: The 50/30/10/10 Rule for How to Wake Up Earlier and Work on Your Dream
  :content: '<p>The 50/30/10/10 Rule for How to Wake Up Earlier and Work on Your Dream</p><p>I
    am not a morning person whatsoever.</p><p>Late last year, I began waking up at
    5:30 AM to write for an hour then drive to work at an engineering firm. It was
    the hardest fucking thing I had done in a long time. But I did it.</p><p>And you
    know what?</p><blockquote><p>I bet you could too.</p></blockquote><p>Imagine how
    much better your day would be if you accomplished your hardest, most important
    work first thing in the morning. The rest of your day would be a breeze. You could
    relax in the evening without feeling like a bum or stressing because you let another
    day slip by without doing what you planned.</p><p>My story of waking up early
    consists of a 50/30/10/10 split of determination, preparation, execution, and
    luck.</p><p>Let me explain…</p><h2><strong>The 50% Determination</strong></h2><p>For
    most of the population, 5:30 AM is not a normal time to be awake. There’s no switch
    you can flip to make yourself consistently wake up that early, especially if doing
    it for your own reasons (i.e. not doing it to avoid being fired).</p><p>Basically,
    it’s going to take some effort.</p><p>It sounds extremely cheesy, but if you want
    to wake up earlier, you’ve got to <strong><em>really want it.</em></strong></p><p>Several
    years ago, I tried waking up earlier to write for my blog before work. I did it
    once and it felt amazing — then I never did it again.</p><blockquote><p>I didn’t
    want it bad enough.</p></blockquote><p>It’s hard to wake up early when you have
    a 7 to 5 PM day job in engineering. It’s much easier to skip writing, go to work,
    consider the day a success, and not work on your own dreams.</p><p>At some point,
    you’ve got to become obsessed with whatever your dream is. For me, that was writing.</p><p>Currently,
    I wake up at 5:30 AM every weekday morning (I give myself an extra hour or two
    to rest on the weekends). I write, then head to work. This article is a product
    of my early rising habit.</p><p>What changed?</p><blockquote><p>I realized I wanted
    to be a writer.</p></blockquote><p>I was no longer satisfied being some mook trying
    to make money online and half-assing it.</p><p>I love engineering, but I don’t
    want to do it forever. I want to be a writer. I still suck at writing, but I want
    to get better. I need to get better. <strong>I’m obsessed with getting better.</strong></p><p>I
    knew if I wanted to be a better writer and change my life, I had to make it a
    priority. That became my determination for waking up earlier.</p><p>If I didn’t
    wake up earlier, I couldn’t write.</p><p>If I couldn’t write, I wasn’t a writer.</p><p>If
    I wasn’t a writer, I wasn’t chasing my dream.</p><p>Until you get to this obsession,
    until you have this revelation, you’ll keep convincing yourself waking up early
    isn’t worth it. You’ll press the snooze and stay in bed.</p><p>How bad do you
    want it? That’s what comes first.</p><h2><strong>The 30% Preparation</strong></h2><p>Determination
    alone brought me about halfway to waking up early consistently. The rest was preparation,
    execution, and luck.</p><p>There were precisely five things I started doing that
    helped prepare me for waking up early.</p><h3><strong>1. Going to bed earlier</strong></h3><p>Most
    people function best on a set amount of sleep. For some lucky few, that’s 6 hours.
    I tend to function better on at least 7–8 hours. I’m guessing maybe you do, too.</p><p>I
    realized that if I planned to wake up 2 hours earlier than normal, and I normally
    sleep 8 hours, I better get to bed 2 hours earlier to keep the status quo and
    my body functioning properly.</p><h3><strong>2. “Winding down” before bed</strong></h3><p>It’s
    hard to convince your body it’s time to fall asleep if you’re operating full throttle
    until you hit the sack. I created a wind-down routine for myself that lets my
    body know it’s time to start preparing for sleep.</p><p>About an hour before bed,
    I stop using any tech devices. On the rare occasion I break my routine, I always
    make sure to dim my phone or laptop screen.</p><p>Then, I’ll make myself a hot
    cup of tea, meditate for about 10 minutes, and get into bed.</p><p>Once there,
    I’ll read from a dimly lit Kindle until I reach a good stopping place or my eyes
    can’t keep themselves open.</p><p>At this point, it’s night-night for Jason.</p><h3><strong>3.
    Planning my morning the day before</strong></h3><p>When I first tried waking up
    early, I’d find myself procrastinating — checking social media and fumbling to
    do something useful. This led to many unsuccessful attempts at waking up early.</p><p>Planning
    my mornings the day before, so that I knew exactly what to work on, helped tremendously.
    I get right to work and don’t waste any time or energy.</p><p>Operating this way,
    my mornings feel like a success, and I want to keep waking up early.</p><h3><strong>4.
    No more drinking caffeine after 2pm</strong></h3><p>This is a rule I implemented
    for myself after reading about <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sleep-newzzz/201312/new-details-caffeine-s-sleep-disrupting-effects">the
    effects of caffeine on sleep.</a> I’m sure this is slightly different for everybody,
    but it works for me.</p><h3><strong>5. Exercising during the day</strong></h3><p>It’s
    proven that <a href="https://sleep.org/articles/exercise-affects-sleep/">those
    who exercise sleep better</a> on a consistent basis. I always try to tire myself
    out with a good workout at some point in the day. Add in all the other stuff above,
    and when it’s time for bed, I have no troubles conking out.</p><p>I’m not saying
    you must do these five things if you want to wake up early, but they helped me
    significantly. At the very least, some sort of plan for waking up early is essential.
    Incorporate some of my preparation ideas above along with your own.</p><h2><strong>The
    10% Execution</strong></h2><p>Now, when the time comes to finally wake up, most
    of the work has already been done for me. The execution piece is straight-forward.
    Here’s how mine looks:</p><p>I set an alarm the night before and say to myself…</p><blockquote><p>“I
    have to get up at five-thirty tomorrow to write.”</p></blockquote><p>Don’t skip
    this step. It might seem silly, but trust me, the mental pep-talk helps.</p><p>Then,
    in the morning upon hearing my alarm, I get up and immediately leave the bedroom.
    No snoozing for this guy. From the moment I reach for my alarm, I keep myself
    in motion and roll out of bed.</p><p>*<em>Don’t *</em>lay in bed checking social
    media, email, or whatever. Just get up and leave the bed.</p><p>*<em>Do *</em>give
    yourself something to look forward to after waking up. For me, that’s a hot cup
    of coffee before getting down to business.</p><p>*<em>Try *</em>setting your alarm
    across the room if you struggle with snoozing. I used to do this but don’t anymore.
    For some strange reason, it actually didn’t work for me, though I’ve heard others
    who do it with success. I found it to be a fun game running to the alarm and seeing
    how fast I could dive back into bed. My brain is weird sometimes.</p><h2><strong>The
    10% Luck</strong></h2><p>As much as I’d like to contribute my success entirely
    to my own actions, I’d be lying.</p><p>About a month after consistently waking
    up early, I felt a dip in motivation. Not everything was going my way:</p><p>I
    was working longer hours at my day job.</p><p>I bought and moved into a new home.</p><p>Things
    were hectic.</p><p>Things were stressful.</p><p>I wanted to sleep in.</p><p>For
    most, these would be viable excuses to give up. However, my (ex-)wife and I had
    just adopted a new puppy. I’ll be damned if that little guy didn’t help me through
    my short slump to stay on habit.</p><p>Every morning without fail, our new puppy,
    Mose, would wake up between 4:30 AM and 5:30 AM having to relieve himself. Not
    wanting the dog to think it was OK to shit on the carpet, I made sure to wake
    up and let him outside. Once I was up, I figured I might as well continue with
    my writing habit.</p><p>Sometimes, a little bit of luck goes a long way.</p><p>Though,
    maybe luck isn’t the right way to phrase this. Maybe “accountability” would be
    better.</p><p>Having a partner to keep you accountable can make a world of difference.
    For me, that happened to be Mose.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*IClgqmm_s-gG-4aEdvMvSQ.jpeg"
    alt="Hard to hate a face like that."><em>Hard to hate a face like that.</em></p><p>Even
    the obsessed and highly disciplined can fall victim to the perfect storm of life’s
    problems. Prepare for this by having a back-up: an accountability partner to carry
    you through those tough times.</p><p>Create your own luck, so-to-speak.</p><p>And
    now, it’s bedtime for this guy. How about you? See you tomorrow bright and early.</p>'

    Turn OFF (almost) all notifications</h2><p>Open the Apple Settings App, then go
    to the Notifications Section. You’re going to need to get good at opening the
    Settings app, so learn to find this icon:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*j4Dp85Nw8fhfY0S07e3Guw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Go app by app, turning off all notifications.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*1VA6GSvzS1_cw5wJowTFJA.png"
    alt="No badges, almost all notifications off. See below for exceptions."><em>No
    badges, almost all notifications off. See below for exceptions.</em></p><p>By
    the end, the vast majority of your apps should have a notifications setting that
    looks like this, i.e with no notifications:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2236/1*PxSyw_f0NmOoCVL2vCsVxA.png"
    alt="Please, please, please: No notifications is best, but at least turn badges
    off."><em>Please, please, please: No notifications is best, but at least turn
    badges off.</em></p><p>There are only a very few reasons to leave notifications
    on for a particular app. Here are those reasons:</p><ul><li><p><strong>For all
    delivery apps</strong>, leave notifications on. These notifications are supposed
    to only come when you want them to, i.e. if you’re standing on the corner trying
    to get a Lyft. Apps in this category: Uber, Lyft, Postmates, Grubhub, Caviar.
    Of those, Postmates is the biggest offender of spamming you with unwanted interruptive
    notifications. Consider deleting that app.</p></li><li><p>If you get very few
    <strong>text messages</strong>, turn off badging on your Messages app but leave
    banners on. Since you’re setting your phone up to have very few notifications,
    you’ll actually end up seeing most of your text messages on your home screen as
    they come in (previously, they were probably swamped by other notifications).
    Then, the unread badge for messages is just overkill to create anxiety about messages
    you already saw. If you get lots of text messages, then turn off all notifications
    and treat text messages like an inbox that you only check at set intervals. If
    you are one of those people sending hundreds of text messages throughout the day,
    then you are crazy and throwing your life away.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*hm389dAanW_vLLg771cvjQ.png"
    alt="Never allow badges!"><em>Never allow badges!</em></p><ul><li><p>Leave notifications
    on for your <strong>calendar app</strong>. Not missing appointments is basically
    the entire point of a cell phone.</p></li><li><p>Leave notifications on for <strong>Maps
    and Google Maps</strong>. These apps only notify you when you’re actively getting
    directions.</p></li><li><p>Leave notifications on for <strong>phone calls</strong>.
    Although, consider turning them off and updating your voicemail to say that phone
    calls are a dead medium. My voicemail says: “<em>You have reached my voicemail
    which means you tried to call me which means you are a dinosaur. Please upgrade
    your life and try me via text or email.</em>” (It doesn’t really say this.)</p></li><li><p>For
    all the notifications that you left on, go back and <strong>make sure badges are
    turned off</strong>. Badges are the red dots with numbers in them that give you
    anxiety that there’s something important going on in that app. You’ll live longer
    if you never see another badge.</p></li></ul><p>I led with this advice to turn
    off notifications because it’s the most powerful. Also, you’re never going to
    finish reading this post if you leave your notifications turned on.</p><p>These
    are the productivity reasons that should make you wary of notifications.</p><h1>1:
    Notifications are uncontrolled interruptions from your real goals. They prevent
    you from ever getting into a flow state. You should be in control of what you
    do and when — not your phone. I’m going to refer to this over and over as “<strong>your
    phone is a tool, not a boss</strong>.” See Appendix A at the end of this article
    for more.</h1><h1>2: The brain science behind learning requires sustained focus
    to <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2014/04/neural-activity-promotes-brain-plasticity-through-myelin-growth-study-finds.html">trigger
    myelin growth around active neural pathways</a>. That’s what brain plasticity
    is about. However, if you go around interrupting that process, you’ll never get
    the myelin growth that locks in whatever you were learning. Essentially, notifications
    lead to a stunted life.</h1><h1>3: Those red dots cause anxiety, and anxiety causes
    health problems like heart disease. It’s not hyperbole that I talked about life
    expectancy in the title of this post. Not specific to red dots, but <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20120731/mild-anxiety-may-shorten-persons-life#1">mild
    anxiety was shown to increase mortality by 20% over a ten year period</a>.</h1><h2>#2.
    Hide social media slot machines</h2><p>‘Slot machine apps’ is a pejorative phrase
    to refer to apps that <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/2012/03/want-to-hook-your-users-drive-them-crazy.html">use
    variable rate rewards</a> to try to trigger mindless and addictive behavior. That’s
    how the app tries to become your boss — although maybe <em>boss</em> isn’t even
    a strong enough word. These are virtual drugs and due to societal oversight, your
    dealer (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat) is allowed to pose as a respectable
    member of society.</p><p>Thankfully, you can configure all of your social media
    to eliminate the addictive elements.</p><ul><li><p>Move Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat,
    Instagram, Pinterest, Periscope, LinkedIn and Tumblr into a folder on your second
    screen. These are addictions.</p></li><li><p>Some people call this folder ‘Social’
    or ‘Media’. For a while, I titled my folder <em>Worthless</em>. That was overly
    judgmental. I’d recommend calling this folder <em>Leisure</em> so that you’re
    being clear with yourself about when to open it.</p></li><li><p>This setup goes
    a little bit deeper, though: hide your favorite social apps on the second screen
    of <em>that</em> folder.</p></li></ul><p>This <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/distracted-in-2016-reboot-your-phone-with-mindfulness-9f4c8ad46538#.nkm16mi7i">last
    trick comes</a> from <a href="undefined">Tristan Harris</a>.</p><p>Here’s what
    I mean. When your addictions are in the first screen of a folder, they’re still
    visibly calling out to you. Still bad:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*kYVfeaKUUzvfPbd8Ex28mA.png"
    alt="Source: [Tristan Harris](undefined)"><em>Source: <a href="undefined">Tristan
    Harris</a></em></p><p>Instead, move your apps to the second screen of that folder,
    like so (the first screen has just one app, the second screen has the rest):</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2250/1*xuzHYjo0nCbx7JVCFAElcw.jpeg" alt=""></p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2250/1*20L-KMqugjD3j8W9u83X5g.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>This
    second-screen-of-folder-on-second-screen strategy requires that at least one app
    be visible. When you reach this decision point for social media apps, you obviously
    should choose LinkedIn. It’s the least addictive.</p><p>Extra credit for people
    that are actual productivity nuts: just delete all your social media apps.</p><h2>#3.
    Hide messaging slot machines</h2><p>This is the same strategy as #2, just for
    messaging apps. Messaging apps also have a built-in variable rate reward — that’s
    what makes them slot machines.</p><ul><li><p>Move your mail apps, Slack, Messages,
    WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger into a folder on your second screen. You decide
    when you check these. Live a life without interruptions!</p></li><li><p>I call
    my folder Messages. The default iPhone folder name suggestion is Productivity.
    <em>That’s an outright lie</em>.</p></li><li><p>Follow the same trick from #2,
    hide all but one of the apps on the second screen of the folder.</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2250/1*aFLb9ZCpmft-2cJMLaHq7Q.jpeg" alt=""></p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2250/1*S5JIBhosXOFAaZYoV2UVKg.jpeg" alt="I
    check these on my own schedule and have all notifications turned completely off."><em>I
    check these on my own schedule and have all notifications turned completely off.</em></p><p>The
    productivity secret for inbox management is to decide when you want to check your
    messages. Then, process them all in one big batch. Batch processing puts you in
    control. Unfortunately, most people live life reactively, constantly checking
    their inboxes for messages to react to. For you to reach your full potential,
    you need to switch to a batch processing mindset for all of your inboxes.</p><p>These
    messaging apps should never interrupt you. This goes back to the brain science
    justification in #1. You want to block off your day so that you have some contiguous
    time dedicated to being smart and creative (no interruptions) and then other blocks
    dedicated to rapid task processing (email, etc.). Cal Newport calls this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X47ZVXM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1&?tag=coachtony-20">Deep
    Work</a> (in a very good book).</p><p>Productivity nuts: consider deleting all
    of these apps. People who set a schedule for when and where they check their inboxes
    often realize they can do all of their emailing from a proper computer. For Slack
    users, private messages and channel notifications are meant to be asynchronous
    — that means you don’t need immediate alerts.</p><h2>#4. Disable App Review requests</h2><p>You
    open an app intending to get work done, and then that app prompts you to leave
    a review. This is an unwanted interruption, and your job is to remove as many
    interruptions as possible.</p><p>So disable these unwanted Review Requests.</p><ul><li>Go
    to Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; iTunes &amp; App Stores.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*OrdCF6czFceNi77OxOXfCQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Is it crazy how we think of computers as productivity devices but
    then allow so many unproductive features? I think it’s crazy. This isn’t just
    some app-developer hack, it’s actually a<a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/system-capabilities/ratings-and-reviews/">
    built-in feature provided by Apple</a>. That’s how blind Apple is to the damage
    caused by interrupting your work flow.</p><p>What’s happening with review requests
    is that when you use free apps, you are actually entering a partnership with the
    app developer where you are working on their behalf, often by clicking on advertisements,
    or in the case of app reviews, by acting as marketing.</p><p>Apps with more positive
    reviews get ranked higher by Apple. As a consequence, app developers tend to interrupt
    you with review requests just as you’re doing something productive.</p><p>Do you
    care about the morality of opting out of this partnership? A savvy user can often
    leach off of the hard work of app developers and the money of investors without
    giving anything back. I’ve been doing that with the MoviePass service — seeing
    twice as many movies as I paid for, all subsidized by some venture capital investors.
    (Unfortunately, that gravy train <a href="https://investorplace.com/2018/10/new-funds-hmny-stock/">seems
    to be ending</a>.)</p><p>When you or I do take advantage, we’re basically stealing.
    This sort of stealing is not illegal, but is it bad for your health? The impact
    off morality on longevity is muddy. As close as I could find was <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-beast/201302/do-religious-people-really-live-longer">research
    on religious vs. non-religious people within the same country</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Religious
    Americans are reported to have more robust immune systems, lower blood pressure,
    and better recovery times from operations, (although these claims have been disputed).</p></blockquote><p>If
    you’re worried about the effect of morality on your longevity, here a few workarounds.
    Manually go to the App Store, look through your recently updated apps, and add
    reviews to each of them. Share your favorite apps with your friends (as I’m doing
    in this post). Or, opt for the pro or paid versions. I’m finding that I almost
    always prefer to pay for an app.</p><h2>#5. Turn on Do Not Disturb</h2><p>Most
    people should have their phone permanently on Do Not Disturb.</p><p>Do Not Disturb
    is not as severe as you might think, thanks to a sub-feature to “Allow Calls From
    Favorites.” As a result, you can still allow certain people to interrupt you or
    wake you up.</p><p>The trick to getting the Do Not Disturb feature to work all
    day is to turn it on from the same time to the same time, such as from 9am to
    9am. I tested it and that works (I was worried it would effectively turn itself
    on and off again in the same minute).</p><p>If, however, you do want strangers
    to be able to contact you (for example, if you work in sales), then just set Do
    Not Disturb for your sleep and leisure time.</p><ul><li><p>Go to Settings &gt;
    Do Not Disturb</p></li><li><p>Do Not Disturb works a little differently on your
    Mac versus on your iPhone. On the iPhone, you just need to toggle it on and make
    sure you don’t toggle the Scheduled option. But on a Mac, Do Not Disturb is always
    scheduled, so turning it on all day requires hacking the schedule to be something
    like 9am to 9am. Many of you though will prefer to just have it on for a set time,
    say 6pm to 9am.</p></li><li><p>Allow calls from your favorites. Now your Favorites
    list actually takes on more meaning: this is your whitelist of people who you
    would allow to interrupt you.</p></li><li><p>There’s a Repeated Calls option to
    allow repeat callers to get through. Do not select this. We absolutely do not
    want to train telemarketers to think this will work.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*QGM11KNsKsqKZ_xvVUDPZw.png"
    alt="You might want to double check who is on your favorites — I added my dog’s
    vet in order to make sure those calls always came through."><em>You might want
    to double check who is on your favorites — I added my dog’s vet in order to make
    sure those calls always came through.</em></p><p>The justification here is similar
    to the steps above. Limited interruptions is smart for a number of reasons, including
    the science of brain plasticity, the health impact of anxiety, and the productivity
    gains of optimizing for deep work (all covered in more depth in Appendix A below).</p><p>What
    the above Do Not Disturb setting allows you to do is to take a ‘whitelist’ strategy
    to interruptions. So rather than banning telemarketers one-by-one (‘blacklisting’),
    you pre-select the very limited number of people who you would allow to interrupt
    your day. For me, that’s my immediate family, my dog walker, and my dog’s vet.</p><h2>#6.
    Be strategic about your wallpaper</h2><p>The absolute best wallpaper is an all
    black background. Choosing black destroys the idea that your phone is some shiny
    toy that you need to be looking at all the time.</p><p>Plus, with OLED screens
    (most new iPhones), black actually saves battery (<a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/11/10/extreme-test-shows-oled-iphone-x-with-dark-mode-saves-nearly-60-battery-over-3-hours">as
    much as 60%</a>). If you chronically run out of battery or are a true productivity
    nut, then black is the best option for you.</p><ul><li>Go to Settings &gt; Wallpaper
    &gt; Choose a New Wallpaper &gt; Stills. The all-black option is right there at
    the end.</li></ul><p>If you can’t stomach making a thousand dollar phone look
    that ugly, choose the black with rainbow stripe option that’s right next to the
    black option in the Stills. That’s what I’ve done for all the screen shots in
    this article.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2250/1*xuzHYjo0nCbx7JVCFAElcw.jpeg"

    Pick Still (saves battery life) and Set Both.</p></li></ul><p>One problem with
    inspirational images is that words often make your phone feel cluttered. It’s
    better to have an image, like a mountain or a person working out, than it is to
    have a quote or motivational phrase. For example, here’s a reasonable set of affirmations
    that just don’t show up well behind various iPhone icons and widgets.</p><p><img

    affirmations, bad background."><em>Nice affirmations, bad background.</em></p><p>If
    you are going to have affirmation or motivational text, a quick hack is to make
    the background yourself in Instagram Stories. Instagram will let you save the
    Story to your phone’s Photos.</p><p>In this case, try to stick to just a single
    word, and place that word low enough that it shows up below your Do-Not-Disturb
    message. If you take this approach, consider two things:</p><ol><li><p>Try just
    using this for your Lock screen rather than your Home screen. Text often works
    better on your Lock screen than it does behind the apps on your Home screen.</p></li><li><p>Try
    creating a new wallpaper every few weeks that has the same affirmation, but a
    different background. That way you don’t become blind to your affirmation.</p></li></ol><p>Here’s
    an example <a href="undefined">Jonathan Howard</a> sent me when he was reviewing
    a draft of this article:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*tWTOGB92Izygpezs"
    alt="Credit goes to [May Alba](undefined) who made this for [Jonathan Howard](undefined)"><em>Credit
    goes to <a href="undefined">May Alba</a> who made this for <a href="undefined">Jonathan
    Howard</a></em></p><p>If you still haven’t found a suitable strategy, pick an
    image with a dominant color that tells a color story to prompt one of the below
    emotions.</p><ul><li><p>Red: Passionate, Aggressive, Important</p></li><li><p>Green:
    Natural, Stable, Prosperous</p></li><li><p>Blue: Serene, Trustworthy, Inviting</p></li><li><p>Black:
    Powerful, Sophisticated, Edgy</p></li><li><p>White: Clean, Virtuous, Healthy</p></li></ul><p>Don’t
    pick orange (cheap) or yellow (warning). If you’re not sure? Pick Red. All of
    these color choices will drain your battery more than a black background, but
    you may find the emotional gain to be worthwhile.</p><p>The reality for me is
    that I alternate between a black background and a meaningful picture. There’s
    some possible science supporting the value of small changes to your work environment
    to create a boost in productivity. Unfortunately, I can’t find a citation, although
    I’m 90% certain I read this in <a href="undefined">David Rock</a>’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Brain-Work-Strategies-Distraction-ebook/dp/B002Q1YE3K/?tag=coachtony-20">Your

    small amount puts your brain on alert (but not so much that you’re anxious).</p><h2>#7.
    Turn off Raise to Wake</h2><p>The Raise to Wake feature lets you quickly see notifications
    on your lock screen just by lifting your phone.</p><p>This is a bad idea. You

    sure you’re the boss and your phone is your tool.</p><h2>#8. Add the Screen Time
    widget</h2><p>The Screen Time widget is new from Apple and it helps show you where
    your time is going. Ideally, the Social Media category will be non-existent. Unsurprisingly,
    I’m not going to be able to find a screen shot where that is true.</p><p>To install
    the Screen Time widget:</p><ul><li><p>Swipe to the Today Screen by swiping right
    from your home screen.</p></li><li><p>At the bottom of the Today screen, select
    Edit. This will bring up a list of apps that have widgets.</p></li><li><p>Tap
    the green plus button for Screen Time to enable the widget, and then tap and hold
    on the three-horizontal-lines button to reorder the widget to be near the top.
    By the end of this article you’re going to have three widgets at the top of your
    Today Screen: Google Calendar, Weather, &amp; Screen Time.</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*HbBelTPakVyVN0_AmoxbRQ.png" alt=""></p><p>You’re
    going to use this widget as a reality check against your own biased memory.</p><p>This
    article is going to recommend a few more widgets later, and then recommend that
    you build the habit of checking the Today View by swiping right from your home
    screen (conceptually, it lives to the left of your home screen).</p><p>It does
    seem to be roughly true that what gets measured gets done. There are a number
    of variants of that quote, but my favorite is “<a href="http://www.thebusinessofgood.org/articles/september-quote-john-e-jones/">What
    gets measured gets done, what gets measured and fed back gets done well, what
    gets rewarded gets repeated</a>.”</p><p>A goal for many of the steps in this article
    is for you to use your phone less, and to use social media apps much, much less.</p><p>This
    widget is how you’ll know if you’re succeeding. I consider it the feedback part
    of the above quote. Then hopefully the reward is an intrinsic satisfaction in
    your own life and productivity.</p><p>In addition to installing the widget, you
    should set yourself a goal for social media usage. Imagine you had a child and
    were setting a limit for how much television they could watch each day. Is one
    hour reasonable? Probably. Is six hours reasonable? No.</p><p>Now, instead of
    this child, consider instead that you are setting limits for yourself, and that
    social media has replaced your television watching time. How much “leisure” time
    each day do you think is appropriate for yourself? If you’re not sure, choose
    thirty minutes. That’s enough time to scan your Facebook and Instagram, drop tons
    of likes on your friends, tweet once, get the gist of the news, and consume a
    huge dose of <a href="https://twitter.com/dog_rates">We Rate Dogs</a>.</p><h2>#9.
    Add content restrictions</h2><p>Sometimes it’s helpful to block yourself from
    certain websites. I have zero pride preventing me from treating myself like a
    toddler in need of parental controls. The reality is that we all could use some
    strict blocks to prevent our worst habits.</p><p>On the iPhone, the feature to
    block specific websites is hidden inside of Apple’s Limit Adult Websites feature.</p><p>I’m
    not trying to make any point at all about your adult website usage. I just want
    to help you find the feature (and it’s the most deeply buried feature in this
    article).</p><ul><li>Go to Settings &gt; Screen Time &gt; Content &amp; Privacy
    Restrictions &gt; Web Content and then select “Limit Adult Websites.”</li></ul><p>Turning
    on this feature allows you to then add specific websites, which don’t have to
    be adult websites at all.</p><p>What you should consider is whether you have any
    habitual behaviors around checking specific websites and then use this feature
    to break those habits. For example, I used to live in San Francisco and so had
    a habit of checking the website for the daily paper. That’s the one site I block
    because I don’t want to have that habit anymore.</p><p>Additionally, I was a huge
    Grantland reader before it was shut down by ESPN. I still type that URL into my
    browser just out of pure muscle memory.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*D3HS4P8sXJOnUq5Mmhp9jw.png"
    alt="Don’t be shy about turning off certain websites. Disabling bad life choices
    is a great strategy."><em>Don’t be shy about turning off certain websites. Disabling
    bad life choices is a great strategy.</em></p><p>If I were designing content restrictions
    for productivity, I’d have one called Google-only, which would allow you to Google
    any term and then click any result. But you’d be blocked from going directly to
    any sites or clicking deeper into any site.</p><p>However, since I’m not the boss
    at Apple, the solution above is the best available approach and is probably ideal
    for most people. I’ll give a more hardcore solution next.</p><h2>#10. (Optional)
    Use restrictions to turn off Safari</h2><p>None of you are going to do this… but
    I tried a month with no access to a web browser. If you are up for this, I definitely
    want to hear from you.</p><p>The theory is that the browser is one of the addictive
    slot machines that draws your attention and wastes your time.</p><p>So I used
    parental controls to disable Safari.</p><p>In practice, I would very occasionally
    need a web browser, so I’d download the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-chrome/id535886823?mt=8">Chrome
    app</a>, do my browsing, and then delete the Chrome app.</p><p>If this method
    of reclaiming your phone at all appeals to you, here’s the secret:</p><ul><li>Go
    to Settings &gt; Screen Time &gt; Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions &gt; Allowed
    Apps and then disable Safari.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*LfyYD7DO_sLmXdpSEOcHkQ.png"
    alt="This screen shot is only for the hardest of hardcore phone addiction-breakers."><em>This
    screen shot is only for the hardest of hardcore phone addiction-breakers.</em></p><p>When
    I tested this, I used Chrome as my occasional browser because the path for removing
    access again was shorter. I trusted myself more to delete the Chrome app than
    to remember to find the Safari restriction option that’s hidden behind five taps.</p><h2>#11.
    Organize your apps and folders alphabetically</h2><p>There are four ways to organize
    your apps: by function, by color, by random chance, and alphabetically.</p><p>You’re
    going to organize your screens by function, and you’re also going to organize
    apps into folders by function. The home screen is for tools only. The second screen
    is apps organized into folders. The third screen is for junk, namely Apple apps
    you aren’t allowed to remove.</p><p>However, on each screen and within each folder
    you have to make additional decisions about organizing. You should <strong>choose
    alphabetically</strong>.</p><ul><li><p>On your home screen, organize all of your
    apps by name, with numbers (like 1Password) coming before letters.</p></li><li><p>In
    your folders, organize the apps hidden behind the first screen alphabetically
    as well.</p></li><li><p>On your second screen, organize your folders alphabetically.</p></li><li><p>I’m
    going to leave it mostly up to you on how to organize apps beyond the first screen.
    Probably, they should mostly be inside folders.</p></li><li><p>I think it’s a
    bad sign if you have apps spilling out into a third screen. Put them in folders!
    The only thing on the third screen should be apps that you can’t uninstall. On
    the latest iOS, you can actually uninstall all the Apple apps except for Wallet,
    Safari, Find iPhone, and App Store. I put all these Apple apps into a folder on
    my third screen, mostly as a precaution in case I need them one day. In practice,
    I mostly just use Wallet and get to that through the right-hand button shortcut
    (double press).</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*dNH4B9tueBCbbmPotPNcsQ.png"
    alt="We’ve barely scratched the surface of why this home page looks the way it
    does."><em>We’ve barely scratched the surface of why this home page looks the
    way it does.</em></p><p>The phrase “your phone is a tool, not your boss” is implying
    that you’re the boss. But it’s more subtle than that.</p><p>We want to set your
    phone up so that your rational brain is the boss, and your emotional, addictive,
    worst-decisions brain is asleep or blocked.</p><p>The best explanation for this
    is in the book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00555X8OA/?tag=coachtony-20">Thinking,
    Fast and Slow</a> (or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman-book-review.html">just
    read the NYT book review for a good overview</a>). The author lays out a model
    for the brain as having two systems.</p><p>The Fast system is our default. It’s
    effortless, instinctual, and functional for staying alive, but also the source
    of most of our worst impulses. It’s the system that likes slot machine apps.</p><p>The
    Slow system is what we think of as our rational brain. It’s analytical, but requires
    effort and intention to access.</p><p>When I train meditation in my <a href="http://bit.ly/2BwcC8S">Heavy
    Mental program</a>, I train a verbal way of moving the thoughts that come up during
    a meditation into our Slow system. That way we can analyze the thought, and then
    drop it. The entire trick is that activating your language center always activates
    your Slow system.</p><p>Here, we’re doing something very similar. When you go
    for an app, I want you to have the actual name of the app in mind. That way it’s
    easier for you to be acting rationally and intentionally. That’s the main reason
    to adopt an alphabetical organizing structure.</p><p>The second good reason is
    that alphabetical is less brittle. Organizing by function is hard because sometimes
    apps have more than one function. Organizing by app name is intellectually trivial
    in comparison.</p><h2>#12. Choose Gmail</h2><p>For the vast majority of people,
    the ideal phone setup is to embrace Google Cloud services (mail, calendar, photos,
    maps) and pair them with Apple hardware.</p><p>If you’re on some other setup,
    like Apple email or Outlook, then stick with that. It’s not worth switching.</p><p>You
    can often configure the Apple apps to connect to the Google services. But it’s
    always better to just use the Google-specific app. In this case, I’m going to
    talk about Gmail.</p><p>Don’t use Apple’s Mail product. Google’s actual Gmail
    app just works more smoothly, especially search.</p><p>And don’t bother with any
    app that promises any sort of “smart” filtering or sorting of your email. Relying
    on somebody else’s algorithms is hugely overrated.</p><ul><li><p>Get <a href="http://gmail.com/">a
    Google account</a> (you probably already have one).</p></li><li><p>Download the
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480?mt=8">Gmail
    app</a>.</p></li><li><p>Put the app in that “Messages folder” we created in Step
    #3.</p></li><li><p>And make sure notifications are turned off (also Step #3).</p></li><li><p>Then,
    delete Apple’s mail app. Apple has only recently started letting you delete built-in
    apps. Take advantage of it!</p></li><li><p>Go to Gmail from your computer and
    disable your inbox tabs. You probably think Google is helping you by automatically
    categorizing your incoming email, but you’ll be way better off developing the
    habit of unsubscribing and manually filtering.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*7Z8QuKnhRM1MasSnenguAg.png"
    alt=""></p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2584/1*JR4hj_jhMRp91p6GvpQTxw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>I hosted a Q&amp;A with Marshall Hughes, who is our most prolific
    <a href="https://www.coach.me/Marshall/882?ref=DbvXq">Inbox Zero coach</a>. Yes,
    that’s a type of coach — a lot of our coaches zero (do you like my pun?) in on
    specific behavior changes.</p><p>In the Q&amp;A, everyone wanted to ask Marshall
    about email automation tools. And Marshall was adamant that every experience he
    had with clients using automation tools turned out badly. Clients who chose automation
    were bailing on essential inbox habits. They’d given up on the most important
    habit of all, which is to say no to email by constantly unsubscribing and manually
    filtering.</p><p>So, paired with the settings above, you should be working on
    your email habits. That means primarily unsubscribing and blocking aggressively.
    I get a lot of extra email too that I consider FYI — for example, I like having
    a history of all of the newsletters we send out, but I don’t need to read each
    one as they come in to my inbox. I filter those into folders and only check those
    folders occasionally.</p><h2>#13. Choose Google Calendar</h2><p>Sticking with
    the Google Cloud theme, use the native Google Calendar app and ignore Apple’s
    Calendar app.</p><ul><li><p>Install the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-calendar-time-planner/id909319292?mt=8">Google
    Calendar app</a>.</p></li><li><p>This is an app where you’re going to keep notifications
    on and just turn off badging. Never allow badging anywhere.</p></li><li><p>Then
    enter the Google Calendar settings.</p></li><li><p>You can change the start of
    the week from Sunday to Monday (or in a few locales, Saturday). I’m a Monday person.
    I don’t understand how any person thinks the week starts on Sunday given that
    Sunday is literally part of the weekEND. But whatever, people have strong opinions
    on this and I can’t dissuade them.</p></li><li><p>Disable “Show declined events.”
    You declined the event so that you wouldn’t have to think about it.</p></li><li><p>Disable
    “Show event illustrations.” That’s a nonsense feature.</p></li><li><p>Then, go
    into Default event duration and set the default to 30 minutes. You don’t need
    an hour for most meetings. If you’re the one creating the meeting, you can be
    in charge of saving your and everyone else’s time.</p></li><li><p>Last, add the
    Google Calendar widget to the top of your Today screen: head over to your Today
    screen (swipe right from your home screen) &gt; scroll down to the edit button
    &gt; turn on Google Calendar &gt; Move Google Calendar to the top.</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2250/1*CMELfmRV9TddKFd37F2M3g.jpeg" alt=""></p><p><img

    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2250/1*al0JOEgTxklJ2hX6CnQknQ.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>The
    two most important subtleties are trying to shorten meetings and building a Today
    screen that’s worthy of a daily habit.</p><p>The Today habit is just you starting
    your day by getting a summary of what’s planned (and later, what the weather is
    like). If you can build this habit, then you can use it to trigger new habits.</p><p>In
    the <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-create-any-habit-with-advice-from-the-four-greatest-habit-masters-9b96528db259">Tiny
    Habits method</a>, checking your calendar would be called an anchor habit. Above
    in the Screen Time section, I’ve already attached a new, not-quite-natural habit
    of checking your Screen Time widget. The reason I think that will work is because
    I trust that you will naturally want to check the calendar and weather, thus triggering
    the new and less natural habit of checking additional widgets.</p><p>On the short
    meetings front, this is literally a chance to save yourself hours each day by
    making the meetings you go to shorter and more focused. The key to focus is to
    have a clear goal, and push directly toward that goal.</p><p>I have one friend,
    a CEO, who wants the time on his calendar to be as precious as the time on a U.S.
    president’s schedule (he told me this during a different administration). If a
    meeting only needs seven minutes, then just give it seven minutes. A different
    friend, also a CEO, set a company policy that if a meeting invite didn’t include
    goals, an agenda, and pre-meeting preparation, you could skip it. The acronym
    there is GAP — no GAP, no need to attend.</p><p>Last, in my screenshot there’s
    a massive amount of time blocked off called “Reserved.” I’m unapologetic about
    scheduling time on my calendar for deep work. You can’t squeeze deep work into
    fifteen minute gaps — you need to carve out contiguous blocks of time. For most
    office workers, I use what Cal Newport calls a “bi-modal day.” That’s where half
    of my day is for deep work and the other is for shallow work, i.e. meetings, email,
    phone calls.</p><h2>#14. Replace Apple Maps with Google Maps</h2><p>Apple Maps
    has gotten better, but it’s still not as good as Google Maps. You’re only going
    to use Apple Maps when you use Siri (it’s Siri’s permanent default).</p><p>Every
    other time, you’re going to use Google Maps.</p><ul><li><p><a href="http://pple.com/us/app">Install
    the Google Maps app</a>.</p></li><li><p>Add Home and Work addresses to My Places
    in the app. This will involve connecting to a Google account. If you have trouble
    and are using a custom Google domain, then you may need to enable some permissions
    from the site admin panel. In that case, these are the <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/apps/QL9LPYc-_bM">instructions
    that helped me</a>.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*kqe3IcMeS5ks1vXT0cVA1Q.png"
    alt="Not my real address."><em>Not my real address.</em></p><ul><li><p>Go to Google
    Maps Settings &gt; Navigation settings and turn “Keep map north up” on. This is
    a power setting for people who actually aspire to build their sense of direction.</p></li><li><p>Add
    Google Maps to your home screen. This is another one of those tools-over-drugs
    apps.</p></li></ul><p>This is yet another example of preferring the Google Cloud.
    And the custom settings for Home and Work are just small time-savers. There’s
    not a huge additional productivity explanation.</p><h2>#15. Install the Gboard
    keyboard for faster typing</h2><p>This will let you type faster through swiping.
    The <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/New-Record-for-Fastest-Typing-Set-on-Galaxy-S-with-Swype-153274.shtml">world
    record</a> for typing on a phone is set through the swipe method: just swipe your
    finger over the letters of the word you’re trying to type. The keyboard will figure
    out what you mean.</p><p>At first this will feel a little uncomfortable, but it
    will quickly become second nature.</p><p>Gboard, from Google, also has <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/429335/10-things-you-should-know-about-googles-gboard-keyboard/">a
    bunch more features</a> too like GIF and emoji search.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gboard-search.-gifs.-emojis/id1091700242?mt=8">Install
    the Gboard app</a>.</p></li><li><p>Now go to your Apple Settings &gt; General
    &gt; Keyboard &gt; Add New Keyboard.</p></li><li><p>It’s easy to accidentally
    cycle back to the old default keyboard, so delete that (don’t worry, you can get
    it back). Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard &gt; Edit. Then delete the
    default one. It’s probably named as a language, like <em>English (United Kingdom)</em>.</p></li><li><p>If
    Gboard isn’t showing when you go to type a message (perhaps you skipped the above
    step), then hit the globe icon to switch to it.</p></li><li><p>I also set my keyboard
    to black before knowing that I could delete the default Apple Keyboard. That helped
    me know visually which keyboard was active. You can also set your keyboard theme
    by opening the Gboard app and heading to themes.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2250/1*HyaTaXsXG6YXSHMzS8OGiw.jpeg"

    likely to write things down on my phone. This is me setting my One Priority for
    the day.</em></p><p>I found that I was so unhappy with the Apple keyboard peck-typing
    that I’d avoid using it altogether. I’m a fast laptop typist, so I’d always postpone
    writing until I got to my desk.</p><p>Now, with swiping, I’m just a little bit
    faster and that’s the difference between not typing anything and being willing
    to type a longer message.</p><p>Where that ties into productivity is what a lot
    of people call the “touch it once” principle. Especially with email, you want
    to avoid reading the same email twice. So if I happen to read a message that needs
    a response, I want to give that response right away.</p><h2>#16. Switch to Google
    Photos</h2><p>This is the last of the settings to use the Google Cloud over Apple’s
    built-in options.</p><p>The main benefit of Google Photos is that the search is
    amazing. They use machine learning to categorize all of your photos so that you
    can later search them. For example, without any work I can find all my selfies
    by just searching for the word <em>me</em>. And I often pull up pictures of my
    dogs by searching for <em>dog</em>. I have even had someone pull up photos of
    a specific handcrafted <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=greenland+kayak+paddle&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjwku2fhdfdAhWyTt8KHb4wAekQ_AUIDygC&biw=1389&bih=780">*greenland

    turning off iCloud storage for photos: Apple ID &gt; iCloud &gt; Photos. However,
    when I did this, I ran into trouble so I’ve left it on. This step isn’t crucial.</p></li><li><p>Most
    people will need to pay for Cloud photo storage (this is true for iCloud also).
    I’m currently on <a href="https://drive.google.com/settings/storage?hl=en">Google’s
    $1.99/month plan</a> for 100GB, but am close to needing to upgrade to their $9.99/month

    Eloise, a pure-bred French Bernard, and Eggs, a mixed Aussie Shepard.</em></p><p>I
    end up storing my photos in four places: Google photos, iCloud, laptop and Dropbox
    sync. That’s because I’m paranoid. I should probably take them out of Dropbox.</p><p>Of
    those, Google Photos is far and away the best experience for looking at my photos,
    thanks to the machine learning behind Google’s search. This is an example of where
    a messy-by-design organization structure beats rigid one. Search is more reliable
    and faster than you trying to manually categorize every photo.</p><h2>#17. Use
    Evernote for all note taking, to-do lists, everything</h2><p>If you already love
    your note taking app and to-do list app, then fine, stick with those. This is
    a recommendation where habits beat tools. Don’t switch if you already have strong
    habits.</p><p>However, if you don’t use a note taking app or to-do list app, or
    are unhappy with what you do use, let me give you a guiding theory that will lead
    you to Evernote: go messy and trust search.</p><p>Put your to-do list in Evernote,
    either by creating one long note that you edit every day or a new note for each
    day. Then put all your other notes in Evernote too. Don’t bother particularly
    with categorization. Instead, just trust that you’ll be able to find whatever
    you want later through Evernote’s search.</p><p>What you end up with is a messy
    but long-term functional system. The other approach, constantly switching apps,
    systems, and categorization schemes always breaks. Always.</p><p>One power of
    a messy to-do list is that not everything has to be a check list item. You can
    mix in quick drafts and longer notes to yourself. Or, as I’ve recommended in my
    <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/replace-your-to-do-list-with-interstitial-journaling-to-increase-productivity-4e43109d15ef">Interstitial
    Journaling technique</a>, to live mindfully, you should literally intermix short
    journal entries and to-do list items.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote-stay-organized/id281796108?mt=8">Install
    the Evernote app</a>.</p></li><li><p>Place it on your home screen.</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*IDZrNecdNFhJLgafdGdMEg.png" alt="Here’s
    an example of mixing todo-lists and journaling. This is called Interstitial Journaling."><em>Here’s
    an example of mixing todo-lists and journaling. This is called Interstitial Journaling.</em></p><p>The
    problem with most productivity systems is that they break. As a result, a lot
    of productivity nuts spend a lot of their time creating new productivity systems
    over and over again. This, obviously, is not productive.</p><p>For that reason,
    where possible, I suggest that you choose messy systems over rigid systems. The
    ultimate messy system that I know you’re all familiar with is the paper notebook.
    A paper notebook gives you incredible flexibility: you can take notes however
    you want, write drafts, sketch outlines, draw pictures, write to-do lists, etc.
    A to-do list app just doesn’t allow for that.</p><p>The downside to paper notebooks
    is that it’s impossible (or at least very hard) to find an old note.</p><p>All
    of that is the argument for merging your to-do lists with your notes, and then
    putting them all into a single cloud-backed note taking system with good search
    features.</p><p>Although Evernote has advanced features that may or (probably)
    may not be a pleasure to use, the basics work well and reliably. I recommend starting
    with free and then upgrading ($60/year) if you bump into a limit on bandwidth
    or offline availability.</p><h2>#18. The case for Calm as your go to meditation
    app</h2><p>I learned to meditate from Headspace. That’s a good option. But guided
    meditation is something that you’ll graduate from quickly. Most people I know
    who meditate don’t still need a daily guide.</p><p>Once you graduate to meditating
    on your own, Calm is the much better option because of their built-in timer and
    tracking. I was an advisor in the early days of Calm specifically because of my
    experience building habit tracking apps.</p><ul><li><p>Install the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calm/id571800810?mt=8">Calm
    app</a>.</p></li><li><p>Calm is good enough and important enough to pay for. It’s
    $59.99/year.</p></li><li><p>Find your way to the Open Ended Meditation in the
    Meditation section. Select one with a bell playing every few minutes (my setting
    is for 5 minutes). That way you can sit and meditate for a set period of time
    while also being confident that your phone hasn’t run out of battery.</p></li><li><p>Also
    find your way to the Breathe option in the More section. This can be a very effective
    way to reset your body.</p></li><li><p>I also prefer not having any background

    is a productivity and performance practice. The explanation for why is a little
    long, so <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/tagged/meditation">I’m mostly
    just going to point you to longer articles we’ve published in Better Humans</a>.
    However, here’s the quick pitch for why the Calm app is about performance and
    not just “calm.”</p><p>A lot of people talk about meditation as a relaxing or
    spiritual practice. That’s fine for them. But you’re reading a productivity article,
    so I’m focused on what meditation does for your productivity.</p><p>The core concept
    comes from the world of deliberate practice, which is when you identify the components
    of skills that are important to your success, and then practice those components
    individually. I want you to approach meditation as a practice session for a skill
    that you’re going to use to help your productivity.</p><p>You should read our
    full article on <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/the-complete-guide-to-deliberate-practice-3a70319be3af">Deliberate
    Practice</a> to get a feel for how to design practice for all important life skills.</p><p>With
    meditation, you’re practicing a two-step process that you will use outside of
    the meditation. The first step is becoming aware of where your mind wandered,
    acknowledging the thought and then putting the thought down. Call that Awareness.
    The second step is bringing your focus back to your point of focus (usually your
    breath). Call that Focus.</p><p>This Awareness-Focus loop is what you are practicing
    during a meditation session. A lot of people feel bad if their mind wanders during
    meditation. But you should actually feel good. The more often your mind wanders,
    the more times you get to practice this Awareness-Focus loop. I tell people what
    they are doing is mental pushups. The more wandering they do, the more pushups
    they get in.</p><p>Now that you’ve practiced, here’s a way to then apply the Awareness-Focus
    loop in ways to be more productive by <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/this-meditation-exercise-builds-mental-muscle-and-cures-procrastination-2f15faade9f3">beating
    procrastination</a>.</p><h2>#19. Install the right goal tracker for you</h2><p>There
    are basically two philosophies for how to use a goal tracker. Both involve picking
    a set of small goals or habits and marking them off in the app each time you do
    them.</p><p>In the Quantified Self philosophy of goal trackers, you are tracking
    your goals simply out of curiosity because you want to get more information about
    yourself. (The word Goal in Goal Tracker doesn’t even come into play.)</p><p>The
    second philosophy is focused on a goal-oriented behavior-change mindset where
    you are using the goal tracker for motivation and accountability in order to get
    yourself to adopt a new behavior and become a better person.</p><p>I simply do
    not understand the Quantified Self philosophy — don’t they want to improve? Every
    time I go to a Quantified Self event, I feel like I’m surrounded by aliens who
    love data but not growth.</p><blockquote><p>“I got all this data about myself.”
    &gt; “And then what?” &gt; “Nothing.”</p></blockquote><p>It just doesn’t make
    sense.</p><p>So my goal tracker recommendation is for a goal tracker I built.
    It is the foundation of the Coach.me community. Most users and most coaches started
    out by forming habits through this goal tracking app.</p><p>Install the<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coach-me-goal-tracking/id530911645?mt=8">
    Coach.me app</a> and consider tracking a few of the <a href="https://medium.com/coach-me-app/top-100-habits-to-track-in-2018-4940bf459d5">101
    most tracked habits in 2018</a>.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*_dyRNLwbs-ap8GbI8J8gbg.png"

    alt=""></p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*7Te465BXOUK59MjRmjwG8w.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Obviously, I’m talking from my own book here. This article is the
    product of prior work that started with this goal tracker and then morphed into
    coaching and personal development publishing. There are many links out there to
    projects we built at Coach.me or articles we published at Better Humans.</p><p>So,
    with the caveat that I’m deeply biased, my position is that I’ve seen all the
    other goal trackers and generally they all use similar formulas and then differentiate
    just a tiny bit on what graphs they show you.</p><p>However, we put every ounce
    of our design effort into something different: your psychology and motivation.
    That includes how we trigger reminders, how we try to avoid triggering guilt,
    how we introduce variable rate rewards for your own good, and how we handle when
    a goal is too challenging for you.</p><p>If you’ve read this far in the article,
    I think you will have picked up on my philosophy, which is that I want to see
    results.</p><h2>#20. Store all your passwords in a password manager, probably
    LastPass</h2><p>Trying to remember hundreds of passwords is a waste of time. Using
    the same password for all your accounts is the fast track to getting hacked.</p><p>There
    are a number of good third-party password managers that are much easier to use
    than Apple’s built in Keychain. If you are already using one, then stick with
    it. This is a principle (covered also in Appendix A) that habits are more important
    than tools. The benefits of your habits around your current password manager outweigh
    the feature benefits of switching to a different manager.</p><p>I use 1Password
    but that’s not what I’m going to recommend to you. I signed up with them a long
    time ago when they had a pay-once option. But now they’ve moved to a subscription
    model that’s quite a bit more expensive than other better options.</p><p>So, if
    you are looking to use a password manager for the first time, then install LastPass.
    It’s the probably best for most people and definitely the least expensive at $24/year.</p><p>Download
    LastPass <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">here</a>. You’re going to need to
    set it up in three places: as an app on your phone, as an app on your computer,
    and as an extension in your computer’s web browser.</p><p>On your iPhone, you’ll
    also need to configure LastPass to fill passwords in Safari. Select your password
    manager from iOS Settings &gt; Passwords &amp; Accounts &gt; Autofill Passwords.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*OVMQB7iA0FfqCyb3Dbq05w.png" alt="Most
    people will be happiest with LastPass."><em>Most people will be happiest with
    LastPass.</em></p><p>The theory behind the value of a password manager comes down
    to pragmatic security and reduced cognitive load.</p><p>Your parents used to memorize
    people’s phone numbers. Now nobody does that anymore. It should be the same with
    passwords — you have better things to remember. That’s a cognitive load reduction.</p><p>Plus,
    password managers can save time. A common trap is to half-way embrace unique passwords
    for each app or site, but then find yourself constantly forgetting and having
    to go through a lost-password routine. This is wasted time.</p><p>On the security
    front, most people who don’t use a password manager end up reusing passwords.
    So when a hacker gets your password to one site, they get it for all sites. Password
    managers aren’t immune to getting hacked either, but at least if you use a popular
    one you’re likely to hear about it when the hack happens.</p><h2>#21. Use Numerical
    as your default calculator</h2><p>After accuracy, the must-have feature for calculators
    is a history. Otherwise you’re going to make a typo and not notice.</p><p>Unfortunately,
    Apple’s calculator does not ship with a history feature. So:</p><ul><li><p>Install
    the lovely <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/numerical-calculator-without/id804548449?mt=8">Numerical
    app</a>.</p></li><li><p>Put it on your home screen. This continues the your-phone-is-a-tool-not-a-boss
    trend for your home screen. When you unlock your phone, you want to feel like
    you’ve picked up a tool that’s completely under your control, rather than like
    you’re on a bender and have just walked into a casino. You’re going to love Numerical
    without obsessively using it.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*wtIiLLYpjJaTKJ5hVXclRA.png"

    apps below."><em>If the low power % in this screenshot causes you anxiety, we’ll

    the top? That’s a history. Having that history saves you time and reduces your
    errors because you can spot when you’ve fat-fingered an entry. Reduce your anxiety
    and live longer.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20120731/mild-anxiety-may-shorten-persons-life#1">Even

    is the same citation I used in the section about turning off notifications.)</p><h2>#22.
    Put the Camera app in your toolbar</h2><p>Technically, this is quadruply redundant.</p><p>You
    can swipe down to get the camera from your control center, tap the camera on the
    lock screen, or swipe left from your lock screen.</p><p>That last, swipe-left
    from the lock screen is really convenient. Practice that. But also add the camera
    to your toolbar.</p><ul><li><p>Move the camera app to the toolbar.</p></li><li><p>While
    you’re at it, go into Settings &gt; Camera and turn on Preserve Settings. This
    means that the app will remember the last mode you were in, i.e. video or photo.</p></li><li><p>Also
    in Camera settings, if you have enough storage, max out the resolution on Record
    Video and Record Slo-mo.</p></li><li><p>Last, in Camera settings, most people’s
    pictures will be framed better if they turn on grid mode. Do that.</p></li></ul><p><img

    camera is a great tool for happiness and gratitude. I’m not talking about preening
    in front of the camera all day. I’m talking about capturing the most interesting
    moments of your day for posterity and to share with others.</p><p>Using your camera
    regularly also helps you develop an eye for detail.</p><p>The general theme of
    this article is to set your phone up to be more present in the world. Looking
    for pictures to take is one way to be more engaged with your surroundings. Stopping
    a meal so that you can capture your food, however, is not the path to living in
    the moment.</p><p>If you are wanting to post pictures to Instagram and Facebook,
    you can consider the placement of the Camera app to be a replacement habit that
    allows you to schedule your social media usage. Take a picture in the Camera app
    and then post it later, during your allotted leisure window.</p><h2>#23. Install
    a Doppler Radar app</h2><p>What does 70% chance of rain mean? Sometimes it means
    there’s a 70% chance of rain over 100% of your area. But it can also mean there
    is 100% certainty of rain, but only over part of your 70% of your area.</p><p>That’s
    confusing. And so the only sane way to check the weather is to compare it to the
    Doppler radar. These radars visualize the rain and the direction that the rain
    is heading. That way you can eyeball for yourself if the rain is actually going
    to affect you.</p><p>Download the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/noaa-weather-radar-live/id749133753?mt=8">NOAA
    Radar app</a>.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2250/1*16MiLzwYt_LcfWj-5WcaSA.jpeg"
    alt="This Doppler shows rain in the NYC area, but nowhere near where I live in
    Brooklyn."><em>This Doppler shows rain in the NYC area, but nowhere near where
    I live in Brooklyn.</em></p><p>While you’re setting up weather, you should place
    this Doppler app on your home screen, and then go to your Today screen and turn
    on Apple’s Weather widget.</p><p>A big part of productivity is planning. You’ve
    heard a million people complain about how inaccurate weather forecasting is. So
    here’s the solution: be your own forecaster.</p><h2>#24. Use this Pomodoro app</h2><p>The
    idea behind Pomodoro is to be fully focused for a set period of time, usually
    twenty-five minutes, and then have a five minute break.</p><p>This is a way to
    train yourself to avoid procrastination. You end up constantly pushing yourself
    a little bit harder to make it to the end of your work period, knowing that you’ll
    get a short reward after.</p><p>The rules of Pomodoro aren’t complicated, but
    it’s still nice to have a dedicated app. There are two good ones, but I prefer
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/be-focused-pro-focus-timer/id961632517?mt=12">BeFocused
    Pro</a> for $2.99 because it can easily categorize your Pomodoros. For example,
    I’m currently in a Pomodoro that I marked for the Writing category.</p><ul><li>Install
    the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/be-focused-pro-focus-timer/id961632517?mt=12">BeFocused
    Pro app</a> and put it on your home screen.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*lKEiufJj90zHRO6CviQgrQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>When do you use Pomodoro? It’s useful for when you are doing individual
    work, like checking your email or working on a project. You wouldn’t use this
    method during a meeting.</p><p>This is one of a handful of strategies in this
    article for beating procrastination. My intention is that you use all of them
    at once. For example, the Meditation section is mostly focused on meditation as
    training that allows you to catch and overcome the feelings that lead to procrastination.</p><p>Pomodoro
    comes at procrastination from a different perspective. It makes for a smaller,
    more achievable goal. A lot of people get down on themselves if they can’t go
    an entire 8-hour work day without procrastinating. Pomodoro helps you set a more
    achievable goal, say 25 minutes. And if that’s too long, make your Pomodoro even
    shorter. You can always start small and build up to your final goal.</p><p>(The
    third main strategy for beating procrastination is next — using Brain.fm for background
    noise.)</p><h2>#25. Use Brain.fm for background noise</h2><p>A lot of people have
    trained themselves to listen to music while they work. But almost all research
    says that performance is poorer in the presence of a background sound.</p><p>One
    obvious benefit, though, of music is social. You put on your headphones and people
    know not to bother you. I often wear headphones with no sound just to indicate
    to my coworkers that I’m busy.</p><p>The research, however, on <a href="http://musicatwork.net/music-at-work-distracting-or-beneficial/">music
    as a background noise</a> is that it’s tricky — there are occasional benefits
    to productivity but also many, many pitfalls. There is another approach: an emerging
    field of auditory science used to boost focus and reduce mind-wandering.</p><p>Brain.fm
    is the best of these brain music options.</p><ul><li><p>Download the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brain-fm-music-for-the-brain/id1110684238?mt=8">Brain.fm
    app</a>.</p></li><li><p>It’s free for a week and then $49.99 per year.</p></li><li><p>Use
    their focus music while you work if you’re suffering from lack of focus or procrastination.</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2250/1*Cl7rwjiRUGQABkfWce0D4g.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>Since
    I come from the world of coaching, I spend most of my time helping people apply
    behavior changes. As a result, I often end up in a place where I think I see certain
    advice working, but I don’t necessarily understand or trust the scientific explanation
    for why that advice works. That’s the case with Brain.fm.</p><p>My experience
    with Brain.fm is that it’s amazing and works exactly as advertised. Sometimes,
    without sound, my brain will have a tendency to wander. With the Brain.fm focus
    music, it some how shuts down that wandering during any dead spots in my work
    (like if I’m waiting for an app to load). As a result, I have more sustained periods
    of focus.</p><p>However, I find their explanation of the science to be inscrutable.
    It sounds exactly like the type of pop-culture brain science that lots of people
    spout. This doesn’t bother me, as long as it works.</p><blockquote><p>The music
    is designed to have effects on neurophysiology via unique acoustic features woven
    into the music (Brain.fm holds patents for key aspects of this process). Examples
    include modulations optimized to evoke entrainment of neural oscillations, filtering
    to exclude distracting sound events, or smooth movement in virtual space to direct
    attention or avoid habituation.</p></blockquote><p>However, Brain.fm have run
    studies funded by the National Science Foundation that back up my experience,
    which is that Brain.fm is better than silence and silence is better than music.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*OEDF4N7HVvjAeOEg.jpg" alt=""></p><p>I
    need to emphasize that this is a corporate-run study that magically ended up with
    a self-serving result. So, more than the science, I just want you to take my word
    for it enough to try it out for yourself (remember, there’s a free trial).</p><h2>#26.
    Subscribe to these podcasts</h2><p>Your podcast app should be on your home screen
    and you should train yourself to listen to podcasts during your commute, while
    cleaning, and during light cardio.</p><p>If you listen to podcasts on the bus
    or subway, here’s an important, little-known fact. It’s preferable to just listen!
    You don’t also have to be playing games and scrolling Instagram. Be a <strong>single-tasker</strong>.</p><p>The

    development until I’ve seen it tested by a third party.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/foundmyfitness/id818198322?mt=2">Found

    and rubbing it in your face. Paired with Gretchen, I feel like you’ll get the
    full emotional range of how to approach life. Jocko’s a no nonsense guy and sometimes
    you need to just quit debating and go take an action.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-unmistakable-creative-podcast/id352721366?mt=2">Unmistakeable
    Creative</a> with <a href="undefined">Srinivas Rao</a>. Most of his interviews

    href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-tim-ferriss-show/id863897795?mt=2">Tim
    Ferriss</a>. Of course you should listen. I thought <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYaMtGuCgm8">episode
    #2</a> was life-changing and have been hooked ever since.</p></li></ul><p>Do not
    approach your podcast subscriptions as if you need to listen to every episode.
    Instead, pick and choose the most recent episodes that feel relevant to you.</p><p>I’ve
    never heard anyone who shares my reasoning for why and how to listen to productivity
    and health podcasts. Most people just think having more information is inherently
    good. That’s not my reason.</p><p>Information is never enough for making important
    changes. You need to get emotionally hooked, amped up and committed. The podcast
    format gives you a chance to connect with advice at an emotional level and really
    feel the social proof. That matters.</p><p>Second, most advice only works for
    some people some of the time. I’ve written before that <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/why-picking-yourself-back-up-is-the-1-self-improvement-strategy-fe287eb283b1">you
    should approach personal development advice as if it only has a 10% success rate</a>.
    The obvious implication is that you’ll always be needing to try lots of approaches
    until you find the one that works for you. Given that observation, it feels entirely
    natural to me that you would listen to both Jocko Willink and <a href="undefined">Gretchen

    there. But if you accept that difficulty (and this is the part of my theory that
    feels like pop brain science), then you realize that you need to start looking
    for ways to rewire your emotional core.</p><p>Then, having accepted that rewiring
    your emotions is part of most behavior design, I’ve started to notice things —
    like that most self-improvement advice is not very rational. That’s by design.
    A self-improvement book is mostly emotional rewiring. That is exactly why you
    need to read the entire book rather than cheating with a summarized version.</p><h2>#28.
    Use Safari this way</h2><p>I’ve tried and like Firefox Focus and Google Chrome,
    but there’s a problem. Either you’ll end up cutting and pasting URLs that auto-opened
    in Safari or you’ll end up having to manage individual app’s preferences about
    how to handle a URL click.</p><p>Skip those complications. Safari is good.</p><p>There’s
    a secret, super rad option in Safari called Reader mode. This mode strips out
    all of the in-article ads, clutter and junk. I find that it does a great job and
    saves me from fat-fingering ads that have been placed inside the body of the article.</p><p>Here’s
    the before and after on an article in Reader mode.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2250/1*oXkO2oGbmD-uLabz_45Flw.jpeg"

    alt="Good bye Car Ad, Hello Steph Curry Article."><em>Good bye Car Ad, Hello Steph
    Curry Article.</em></p><p>To turn on reader mode once, there’s a little four line
    icon at the top left of Safari. I’d managed to find that on my own.</p><p>What
    I hadn’t realized was that if you long press on that icon, you’ll get an option
    to turn on Reader mode permanently for that site. This is amazing and completely
    changed my experience of reading articles on my phone.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*hmf_Y7eqC-r8qNOgWiSI_A.png"
    alt="Long press on the Reader icon on the top left. Then turn it on for the current
    site or all sites."><em>Long press on the Reader icon on the top left. Then turn
    it on for the current site or all sites.</em></p><p>There are two things that
    you’re setting up here.</p><p>One is that you’ll flat out save time by not seeing
    or accidentally tapping any ads. That’s a small productivity gain each day.</p><p>The
    second is related to being in charge of your phone. You don’t want to see ads
    because you don’t want your phone telling you what to buy and when. Advertising
    on your phone breaks the tool-not-boss rule.</p><h2>#29. Organize your home screen
    for deep learning over shallow learning</h2><p>You’ve hidden all of your shallow
    social media experiences in a folder on your second screen. Now, build a replacement
    habit for those dead times in your day when you would be tempted to be on Twitter
    or Facebook.</p><p>Pick the media that actually makes you smarter and then put
    apps for that on your home screen.</p><p>My apps are Medium, Kindle and Podcast.
    Maybe you include the Washington Post (although that’s probably an anxiety producer
    that doesn’t actually need to be checked all day).</p><p>These are your deep learning
    apps and you just need to make sure they are easier to find than your old, shallow,
    addictive apps.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*y-ZYrlepRxTgezrJpY1uCg.png"

    is hiding on this screen. When do you listen to that? My recommendation is to
    do deep listening, i.e. pick an album and listen to it while single tasking.</em></p><p>Replacement
    habits are a very common strategy in behavior design. The underlying brain science
    is that it’s <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/668583/why-forming-a-new-good-habit-is-easier-than-breaking-a-bad-one">easier
    to create a new habit than to delete an old habit</a>.</p><p>In fact, you don’t
    ever really delete old habits. You might stop using the neural pathway for your
    old habit, but the neurons are still there, waiting for a moment of weakness.
    Eventually those cells will die out. But there isn’t actually a way for you to
    train them to death.</p><p>That’s why we use replacement habits so often. You
    can train a new, strong habit that supersedes your old habit. In this article,
    we’ve come at social media usage in a bunch of ways, all of which work together.
    We’ve tried to short circuit your existing habits by moving the apps, we’ve added
    accountability through Screen Time, and in this section, we’ve finally introduced
    the replacement habit that you’ll do instead.</p><h2>#30. Track steps this way</h2><p>Skip
    this step if you already have a way you track steps. Lots of you have Fitbits
    or other ways to do this.</p><p>If you aren’t already using a pedometer, your
    iPhone will automatically track steps for you in the Health App. However, you
    don’t want to have to open that app in order to see your step count.</p><p>So,
    you’re going to need to install an app that comes with a Today screen widget.
    My recommendation is Pedometer++.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*IjhiZVTT5VlkpFKlcgsXzw.png"
    alt=""></p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*wVUc_fJhGvh95Wro_DwliA.png"
    alt="Widget and in-app views."><em>Widget and in-app views.</em></p><ul><li><p>Go
    to Settings &gt; Privacy&gt; Motion &amp; Fitness and make sure that Fitness Tracking
    is turned on.</p></li><li><p>Then install the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pedometer/id712286167?mt=8">Pedometer++
    app</a>.</p></li><li><p>Add the Pedometer++ to your Today home screen.</p></li></ul><p>You’re
    building up reasons now to check your Today screen daily. That’s good.</p><p>Also,
    I went looking for some research to include here on the benefits of 10,000 steps.
    Unsurprisingly, the pleasing roundness of that number owes more to marketing than
    to any particular science (9,901 steps is practically just as good).</p><p>There
    is quality research on the health benefits of even tiny amounts of walking (much
    less than 10,000 steps): <a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/publicaffairs/news/2015/04/04-30-15_short_walks_offset_hazards_of_sitting_too_long.php">trading
    two minutes of sitting per hour for two minutes of walking per hour reduced mortality
    by 33%</a>.</p><p>That’s not a justification for doing a full more-is-better 10,000
    steps though. The science for doing more walking is mixed, and requires piecing
    together your own projections. For instance, this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14715035">2004
    Arizona State paper</a> classifies people who walk 10,000 steps as active and
    people who walk 12,500 as highly active. But they leave it up to you to cross
    reference other studies on the health benefits of being in either activity category.</p><p>So,
    my recommendation is to wait on the science and trust your gut instead. For most
    people, walking feels good. It’s a chance to use your body, to build up pride
    in a consistent amount of activity, to listen to podcasts, to see your town or
    city. Those should be reason enough.</p><h2>#31. Prefer time restricted eating
    over calorie counting</h2><p>You’ve heard losing weight is calories in, calories
    out (CICO). And then you might have also heard this <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/why-caloric-restriction-fails-9dc18fe9cf23">is
    wrong</a> <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/debunking-the-calorie-myth">or
    at least misguided</a>.</p><p>The official position in the Better Humans publication
    is that CICO is just the wrong framing. Rather, instead, you need to think: <em>to
    lose weight, I need to burn fat.</em></p><p>Our position is that weight loss is
    all about putting your body into fat-burning situations.</p><p>Calorie restriction,
    it turns out, is not guaranteed to lead to a fat-burning situation. It can instead
    lead to a lower metabolism.</p><p>What does lead to fat loss then? Low carb diets
    and fasting. And the most common form of fasting is time-restricted eating, where
    you fit all your eating into an 8 hour window and then fast for the next 16 hours.
    People refer to this as 16:8.</p><p>Additionally, my experience watching people
    diet (I ran a <a href="https://medium.com/coach-me-app/pursuit-of-the-perfect-diet-be4809e34563">15,000
    person diet</a> study and have had more than 100,000 dieters come through Coach.me),
    is that time restricted eating is an easier behavior change. Basically, it’s easier
    to train your body to skip breakfast than it is to give up carbs, not for a month,
    but for the rest of your actual life.</p><p>Of course, you can combine both approaches.
    But if you had to pick one, I’d start with time restricted eating.</p><p>If you
    absolutely want to go Low Carb, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/myfitnesspal/id341232718?mt=8">download
    MyFitnessPal</a> and upgrade ($49.99/year) so that you can track macros. You want
    to keep your carbs below about 50g. If you don’t pay for the upgrade, you’ll only
    be able to see calories and I’m telling you that’s not effective.</p><p>But really,
    where I want you to start is just to skip all of that food restriction stuff and
    start with time restricted eating. As an example, I try to stop eating before
    8pm and then don’t start again until noon the next day.</p><p>To track all of
    this, use an app called Zero and put it on your home screen.</p><ul><li><p>Install
    the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zero-fasting-tracker/id1168348542?mt=8">Zero
    app</a>.</p></li><li><p>When you stop eating today, open the app and start your
    fast.</p></li><li><p>Don’t eat again until your fasting counter hits 16 hours.</p></li></ul><p><img

    explanation</a> why fasting leads to burning fat and why simple calorie restriction
    leads to lower metabolism comes from <a href="undefined">Dr. Jason Fung</a>.</p><p>Consider
    that your body has two primary sources for fuel. One is glycogen, i.e. the carbs
    you eat. And the other is stored fat. Your body uses insulin to switch from one
    source to the other.</p><p>Specifically, when you are in a fed state, i.e. you
    ate recently, your body releases insulin, which inhibits your body from burning
    fat. Dr. Fung’s uses a train track visualization below and I always try to keep
    in mind which track I’m intending to be on.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ngop5o8I_kfu7vQCAe5ahQ.jpeg"

    alt=""></p><h2>#32. Schedule Night Shift starting 4 hours before you normally
    go to bed</h2><p>Night shift “shifts” the colors of your display away from the
    blue spectrum and toward the warmer (redder) spectrum. That’s supposed to help
    you sleep better.</p><ul><li><p>Go to Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt;
    Night Shift.</p></li><li><p>Schedule Night Shift starting four hours before your
    normal bed time.</p></li><li><p>Move the warmth slider all the way to the right
    (More Warm).</p></li></ul><p>The standard advice seems to be to avoid screen time
    and blue light starting two hours before your bed time.</p><p>However, my experience
    with sleep coaching is that people are often going to bed much later than they
    should, often because of a phone addiction. Starting Night Shift four hours earlier
    gives you an opportunity to both go to sleep more easily and also to shift your
    bed time up. If you find yourself going to bed earlier, then just get up earlier.
    Congratulations, you’ve become a morning person.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*YoeXoVmrv3aD-b1AXMNxcw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The case against screens is strong. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/4/1232">Here
    a quote from one study</a>:</p><blockquote><p>We found that the use of these devices
    before bedtime prolongs the time it takes to fall asleep, delays the circadian
    clock, suppresses levels of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin, reduces the
    amount and delays the timing of REM sleep, and reduces alertness the following
    morning.</p></blockquote><p>All bad.</p><p>The science for the red shift as a
    solution to all of the above negative effects is much more iffy. In fact, Night
    Shift is a pretty silly feature. The studies say blue light is bad. But at the
    time the Night Shift feature was built, nobody had done proper testing of red
    light. It turns out <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa2016231">red light
    is also bad</a>.</p><p>So, the reason I like this feature is because it’s a prompt
    to start working on your evening routine to head to bed. Basically, it’s just
    a color coded reminder. That’s it.</p><h2>#33. Set up Medical ID</h2><p>The Medical
    ID feature makes key medical information available to strangers when your phone
    is locked.</p><p>If you are incapacitated during a medical emergency, a stranger
    can go to your power-off screen (long press right button and volume up on modern
    iPhones). That’s where your Medical ID info will be.</p><ul><li><p>Go to Health
    App &gt; Medical ID &gt; Edit</p></li><li><p>Everyone should add an emergency
    medical contact.</p></li><li><p>Your medications and medical conditions would
    be public to anyone who picks up your phone. If that worries you, put a note instead:
    “Call emergency contact for medications and medical conditions.”</p></li><li><p>Knowing
    your blood type doesn’t appear to be very helpful in an emergency situation. <a
    href="https://www.quora.com/How-fast-can-paramedics-find-out-what-my-blood-type-is-in-an-emergency-situation">Paramedics
    aren’t carrying blood</a> — they pump you with fluids instead. Then when you reach
    the hospital, they’ll give you the universal donor, O-negative.</p></li><li><p>I
    labeled myself an Organ Donor and went through Apple’s DonateLife integration.
    Then I tweeted about it. The more people who sign up for Organ Donation, the more
    likely your own life is going to be saved. So the selfish step here is to use
    your own organ donation status to encourage other people to become organ donors.</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2062/1*TDmB21NxwqH5EYU7Q8F1Lg.png" alt=""></p><p>I
    see Medical ID as having three practical benefits to you, in order of likelihood.</p><ul><li><p>A
    kind stranger finds your lost phone and calls your emergency contact.</p></li><li><p>You
    have a life-threatening situation, and the doctors call your emergency contact.</p></li><li><p>You
    influence someone else to become an Organ Donor and then they end up donating
    an organ to you. The literal likelihood of this is very, very low.</p></li></ul><h2>#34.

    is going to get weird and darkly introspective.</p><p>Originally, I’d looked into
    changing Siri’s voice because somebody had told me that men are more likely to
    be cruel to a female-voiced AI. You know what I mean about getting frustrated
    when Siri or Alexa makes a mistake. Alexa, especially, likes to butt in and is
    just begging to be told to shut up. I’m constantly having to tell Alexa, “Alexa,
    stop.” but how close am I to cracking and yelling “Shut up, bitch?”</p><p>I don’t
    treat any woman in my life that way and I don’t want to start with a robot.</p><p>I
    couldn’t find any research at all to back up this idea of gendered cruelty to
    robots, although I did find <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/i-judge-men-based-on-how-they-talk-to-the-amazon-echos-alexa.html">published
    anecdotes</a>:</p><blockquote><p>When Jeremy barked orders at his personal assistant,
    she didn’t flinch, but I did. Something about the sound of his sharp, commanding
    tone — directed not at me, but still, at a woman — repulsed me. In the few weeks
    we had been dating, he had never spoken to me this way. But could he? Hearing
    Jeremy make ungrateful demands didn’t make him seem powerful or important. He
    sounded entitled and difficult, like someone who enjoyed commanding for the sake
    of commanding. He would ask her to do things he could easily do himself, almost
    as if to prove that he could. Surely, it would take less time to reach out and
    hit the light switch by the door than to bark “ALEXA. LIGHTS ON” every time he
    entered the apartment.</p></blockquote><p>Not finding more established research,
    I backtracked to to the person who’d originally told me this. Her sources were
    multiple backchannel discussions from people who work on these AI products. People,
    not just men, say the rudest, cruelest things to female AIs, much ruder and cruder
    than they do to male AIs. If I can get one of these AI product people on the record,
    I’ll add it to this post.</p><p>Our relationships to robots is so weird and interesting
    and scary — there’s deep cultural conditioning, new robot etiquettes, power dynamics,
    etc.</p><p>At heart, I’m worried about developing patterns with my female AIs
    that I don’t have with my female friends, peers and colleagues. And what if those
    AI patterns transfer over to my human interactions?</p><p>You might think the
    opposite, why can’t I practice treating my female AIs with respect and grace?
    I don’t have a good answer. I just know that this dynamic is worth examining in
    yourself.</p><p>Was this too weird of a tangent? This is honestly the type of
    shit I think about all day.</p><h2>#35. Change your phone’s name</h2><p>The default
    is something like, “Tony Stubblebine’s iPhone.” That exposes your privacy when
    you have your hotspot turned on, and advertises to the entire world that you don’t
    know how to customize your phone.</p><p>There are three strategies for choosing
    a new name:</p><ol><li><p>Entertain the people around you. For example, “<a href="https://wifinames.net/funny-wifi-names/">Pretty
    Fly for a Wifi</a>.”</p></li><li><p>Advertise your services, “$15 off coach.me
    w/ HOTPROMO”</p></li><li><p>Inspire yourself with positivity. I got this idea
    from an old Hippie Cafe in San Francisco that named everything after an affirmation.
    To order the enchiladas you’d end up saying something like “I Am a Glamorous Goddess.”
    You can browse <a href="http://places.singleplatform.com/cafe-gratitude/menu">their
    old menu for inspiration</a>, or just take my recommendation. I chose “I Am Focused”
    and now my phone shows up as “I Am Focused.”</p></li></ol><p>Here’s how to set
    this yourself:</p><ul><li>Go to the Settings app and then navigate to General
    &gt; About &gt; Name.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*6efQvoSR_vb-mcB1Gh0o-A.png"
    alt="NSA-car-on-the-corner is someone using strategy #1."><em>NSA-car-on-the-corner
    is someone using strategy #1.</em></p><p>Positive self-talk is actually surprisingly
    effective. I always thought it was too woo-woo, but then I tested it out with
    some people at work. They all said it was more effective than anything we’d ever
    done, including journaling, meditation, sleep, priority setting, and morning routines.
    People have a lot of negative self-talk that they don’t like, but which they haven’t
    taken the time to train theirselves out of.</p><p>If you’re interested in positive
    self-talk, I got my start with <a href="https://www.panoply.fm/podcasts/bythebook/episodes/57z4vTurheGOsMSKsAwWkY">this
    By the Book episode</a>, where they read and tested a book about changing your
    self-talk.</p><p>Of course, training yourself to be more positive isn’t as simple
    as changing the name of your phone, but it’s a start.</p><h2>#36. Turn off advertising
    tracking</h2><p>If you turn off advertising tracking, then the ads you see won’t
    be specifically targeted to you and what advertisers know about you. The point
    here is that getting less targeted ads is good. You want to spend money on your
    own terms.</p><p>This is a variant on “your phone is a tool, not your boss”. When
    you want to spend money, you want to use your phone for research and then make
    a purchase based on that research. You do not want the other way around, where
    your phone is telling you or brainwashing you what to buy. You are the boss.</p><ul><li>Go
    to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Advertising. Turn on Limit Ad Tracking.</li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*414Zm934x3JqEolEh4Mxpw.png" alt=""></p><p>You’re
    still going to get advertising in some places, but almost all of the advice I’ve
    given here includes paying for the ad-free version of the apps you use.</p><p>Paying
    for ad-free apps probably saves you money, as you’re less likely to buy something
    you don’t want.</p><h2>#37. Set auto-lock to the maximum time</h2><p>When you
    stop using your phone, it’ll auto-lock to prevent some stranger from grabbing
    your phone and digging through your private info. That’s basically a good feature,
    but most often the result is that you end up locking yourself out.</p><p>Most
    people keep their cell phones on their person — so keeping your phone locked is
    not a huge security risk. We’re only talking about five minutes — that’s the maximum
    auto-lock setting. If you check your phone on the way into your gym, walk to your
    locker, put your phone in your locker, change into your workout clothes, lock
    your locker and walk away, your phone has probably already locked itself. (Plus,
    most of you actually take your phone out to the gym with you!)</p><p>So the strategy
    here is to save yourself the few seconds it takes to unlock your phone by extending
    the auto-lock time.</p><ul><li><p>Go to General &gt; Settings &gt; Display &amp;
    Brightness &gt; Auto-Lock.</p></li><li><p>Max out auto-lock to 5 minutes.</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*osGJBvA0ixdX0rCA0xHqLQ.png" alt="“Never”
    would be too aggressive."><em>“Never” would be too aggressive.</em></p><p>My take
    on the value of saving time here is that those few seconds of waiting for a phone
    to wake up is when you are at risk for getting distracted. So, worst case this
    setting saves you a few minutes of time (<a href="https://www.freshrelevance.com/blog/how-often-do-people-really-check-their-mobile-phones">research
    says you check your phone 25 times per day</a>). But best case, it saves you from
    30 minutes of goofing off.</p><h2>#38. Set your personal hotspot password to a
    random three-word phrase</h2><p>Sometimes you need to share your hotspot password
    with a close friend or loved one. A random three-word phrase is something you
    can say out loud that they won’t have trouble spelling.</p><p>This is also a more
    general trick for creating quality passwords that are easy for you to say or remember.
    Think about your router’s password for example and how you’re always having to
    share it with guests. Sharing a three-word phrase is so much easier than a string
    of random letters and numbers.</p><p>The debate about the security of this strategy
    for passwords ranges from <a href="http://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/">very
    positive</a> to <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/03/19/multi-word-passphrases/">just

    this is not my actual password."><em>I did an edit pass to try to remove my private
    info from this article — so this is not my actual password.</em></p><p>I spent
    a summer driving all over the United States, totaling 9,000 miles while working
    from a campervan. I know a thing or two about internet access from weird spots.
    In almost all places, using my phone as a hotspot beat out trying to find local
    wifi. My phone was faster and more convenient. This setting is about making your
    hotspot even easier to use, especially when you are connecting new devices to
    it or sharing it with traveling companions. That can actually be a real productivity
    win.</p><h2>#39. Turn on Control Center everywhere</h2><p>Swipe down from the
    top-right of your screen and you’ll have access your Control Center which contains
    toggles for wifi, bluetooth, flashlight and more.</p><p>Apple wants to give you
    the option to turn this behavior off when you’re inside of a different app. That’s
    a mistake.</p><p>The main reason to have always-on access to the control center
    is so that you can toggle wifi on and off. Direct, manual toggling of the source
    of your internet is an important way to control the speed of your app experiences.</p><ul><li><p>Go
    to Settings &gt; Control Center. Enable Access Within Apps.</p></li><li><p>While
    you’re here, go to Customize Controls. You might want to add some more options.
    I put my alarm and timer here since I use both and want shortcuts.</p></li></ul><p><img

    videos should always play in portrait mode.</em></p><p>There have been dozens
    of times where I’ve wondered why an app was slow and then realized the culprit
    was either the wifi or the cell signal. As someone who travels a lot, I often
    find that I get the best internet speeds when I’m willing to take direct control
    of switching between wifi and cell service. Sometimes one of those is much stronger
    than the other.</p><p>When you are using your phone as a tool, then fast internet
    is a direct link to productivity. That’s the main reason to have access to the
    Control Center.</p><h2>#40. Turn on Background App Refresh</h2><p>This setting
    used to clog up your bandwidth and kill your phone battery. But we’re in a new
    era of fast bandwidth and better batteries. So turn it on.</p><p>The upside is
    that you’ll have one less thing to manage, and all of your apps will stay updated
    automatically.</p><ul><li>Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Background App Refresh
    and make sure everything is toggled on.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*6aKlh3oeSWW-k59AMOPjDg.png"

    budget</strong>. When automation works well, you’re saving your brain cycles to
    do something better. That’s the case here.</p><h2>#41. Delete Garage Band</h2><p>GarageBand
    was 1.8GB when I went to check my installed apps. On a new phone, I’m not planning
    to do a lot of managing my storage, but 1.8GB is enough to get my attention.</p><ul><li><p>Go

    alt="Never used Uber? That’s how you can tell this is a new phone."><em>Never
    used Uber? That’s how you can tell this is a new phone.</em></p><p>This is the
    sort of thing that’s better to do now, while your focused attention is on setting
    up your iPhone. You’re saving yourself time down the road when you run out of
    storage at an inopportune time.</p><h2>#42. Develop verbal memory for talking
    to Siri</h2><p>Some people take right away to talking to Siri, and other people
    don’t.</p><p>The problem is the mental version of muscle memory. If you’ve never
    talked to Siri, then it’s hard to muster the new behavior in those occasional
    times where it would be useful.</p><p>Here’s what I suggest: go through the script
    below a few times and see if anything sticks. You can turn on Siri by long pressing
    the button on the right of your iPhone. In parentheses, I’ve listed the phrase
    that will reverse the alarm or reminder that you just set.</p><ul><li><p>Set alarm
    for tomorrow at 8am. (Turn off alarm)</p></li><li><p>Remind me to check the oven
    in 35 minutes. (Remove reminder to check the oven)</p></li><li><p>How old is Malcom
    Gladwell?</p></li><li><p>Timer for 10 minutes (Turn off timer)</p></li><li><p>What
    is 20% of 46?</p></li></ul><p>Now do something to make calling people easier.
    Set a nickname for a loved one, like your mom.</p><ul><li><p><Person’s full name>
    is my mom</p></li><li><p>Text my mom love you</p></li></ul><p>What we just did
    here is a tactic called deliberate practice. When most people read about an iPhone
    trick, they will try to store the trick away in their memory, hoping that they
    will remember that trick down the road.</p><p>I want you to consider a much more
    effective approach. If you ever think you want to use a new trick or behavior
    later on, try practicing it first. The practice makes later recall so much more
    likely.</p><p>This is really a life philosophy to build in practice time for all
    of your life and work skills. For a very deep dive, see <a href="undefined">Jason
    Shen</a>’s <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/the-complete-guide-to-deliberate-practice-3a70319be3af">Complete
    Guide to Deliberate Practice</a>. This is the same article I recommended in the
    Meditation step.</p><h2>#43. Set up these Text Replacement shortcuts</h2><p>There
    are basically two keyboard shortcuts that everyone should have. One is for your
    email address and the other is for your home address.</p><p>Once you get used
    to the power of shortcuts, you’ll probably start adding more.</p><p>Go to Settings
    &gt; General &gt; Keyboard &gt; Text Replacement</p><ul><li><p>Add your full address.
    I used the shortcut: <em>ma</em></p></li><li><p>Add your full email address. I
    used the shortcut: <em>em</em></p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*slsot1o6CrQhKaz3Ltjk6Q.png"
    alt="It’s easy to make the mistake of getting the phrase and shortcuts reversed.
    You should test these right after adding them."><em>It’s easy to make the mistake
    of getting the phrase and shortcuts reversed. You should test these right after
    adding them.</em></p><p>Now when you type either of those shortcuts, you’ll get
    an option to autocomplete to your full text replacement.</p><p>This is a pure
    and simple productivity hack. No discussion necessary.</p><h2>#44. Set your address</h2><p>There
    are at least (at <em>least</em>) five places where your phone will pull your home
    address.</p><p>If you went through the Google Maps section, then you added a home
    address there.</p><p>If you went through the Text Replacement section, then you
    set a shortcut for your address.</p><p>There are still three more places to set:</p><ul><li><p>Go
    to Settings &gt; Apple Id Etc. &gt; Payment &amp; Shipping.</p></li><li><p>Go
    into Settings &gt; Wallet &amp; Apple Pay and check your Shipping Address option.</p></li><li><p>Also,
    Siri pulls your home address for your personal entry in your contacts. Go into
    Contacts and then edit your own entry in order to make sure it’s current.</p></li></ul><p>Boom.
    Now you’ve saved yourself some typing down the road. That’s productivity.</p><h2>#45.
    Backup this way</h2><p>Yes, you should have backups even though practically every
    app you install stores your data in the cloud. But backups do make it much easier
    to set up a new phone when you upgrade (or lose it).</p><p>I strongly suggest
    iCloud backups — they’re cheap. I’m on the $10.99/year package for 20GB and creeping
    toward the next level which is just another $0.99/month for another 30GB.</p><ul><li>Go
    to Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; iCloud.</li></ul><p>There should be options there
    to manage your iCloud storage and which apps get backed up. You should back up
    most of them given how cheap storage is.</p><p>I used to resist paying for backups,
    but the math on the time savings alone is great. You’ll pay a few tens of dollars
    to save yourself hours of work when you upgrade your phone. And then you’ll save
    yourself a huge headache if you actually do lose your phone completely.</p><h2>Appendix
    A: Principles</h2><p>Below are the principles that come up over and over again
    in this article. Where possible, I’ve tried to cite science.</p><p>However, many
    of these principles come through my work at Coach.me. We started as a gamified
    habit tracker, and through that experience, we helped a few million people form
    a few tens of millions of new habits. The vast majority of those people were motivated
    by productivity or health.</p><p>And then, also through Coach.me, I ran a brain
    training group that worked individually with 2,000 people and, separately, started
    a behavior design coaching certification that’s produced coaches who’ve worked
    more than with 20,000 clients.</p><p>So, the principles that don’t have citations
    are, <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/opinion-the-big-lebowski-well-thats-just-like-your-man-26BRrSvJUa0crqw4E">well,
    just, like, my opinion, man</a>.</p><h3>#1. Your phone is a tool, not a boss</h3><p>No
    need to lead with science here — this starts as dead simple philosophy. What’s
    the point of life? Abdicating your life to be a servant of your phone is a shitty
    approach.</p><p>Moreover, a lot of research points out that your phone is not
    a very good boss. See <a href="undefined">Tristan Harris</a>’ <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3">How
    Technology is Hijacking Your Mind</a> or <a href="undefined">Linda Stone</a>’s

    Apnea</a>.</p><h3>#2. Shave seconds to break procrastination</h3><p>There are
    a handful of exercises in this article that have very small surface-level productivity
    gains. Does it really matter if you save one second every time you open your phone?</p><p>I
    say yes. In my experience training people to break procrastination or enter flow
    states, those pauses are prime times for you to get distracted. In those cases,
    a two second pause can turn into a 30 minute break.</p><p>If any programmers are
    reading this, what is the honest answer to how long it takes to run your automated
    tests? Is it the literal time that the tests run, or the time of the break you
    take while the tests are running?</p><h3>#3. Conserve cognitive budget</h3><p>From
    my piece on <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/superhuman-cognitive-stamina-9c8cab847d9e">Superhuman
    Cognitive Stamina</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Every decision, big or small, every moment
    of mental focus, and every act of comprehension is part of your day’s cognitive
    stamina. Let’s call that your <strong>cognitive budget</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>Many
    people look at this as the Steve Jobs turtleneck story. What did he wear to work
    every day? A black turtleneck. So while you were spending your cognitive budget
    getting dressed, he was saving his up for when he got to work.</p><p>So, on your
    phone, you want to look for places to eliminate decisions ,because you’ll use
    those decisions somewhere else.</p><p>This <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?pagewanted=all">NYT
    piece is the right primer</a> on the research that says willpower is limited.
    This other NYT piece is the right primer on Carol Dweck’s work that points to
    the opposite conclusion, that<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/opinion/sunday/willpower-its-in-your-head.html">
    self-belief determines if willpower is a limited resource</a>. Science is so frustrating
    — two seemingly opposing views. I believe willpower is limited, but trainable.</p><h3>#4.
    Messy systems beat rigid systems</h3><p>When you spend time in the productivity
    world, you start to realize how much time people spend playing around with productivity
    systems.</p><p>Part of this is that a lot of productivity nuts are pursuing productivity
    as a hobby — essentially, they are role-playing a world where they are more successful.
    So for them, it’s fun to constantly tweak systems and try new tools.</p><p>However,
    the other reason people spend so much time changing tools and systems is that
    rigid tools and systems break. When they break, it’s almost always easier to just
    start over from scratch with a new system.</p><p>So, where possible, try to use
    a messy system. Those will tend to be less fragile. In this article, the most
    common messy systems were backed by a strong search feature.</p><h3>#5. Habits
    beat tools</h3><p>A strong habit is a case where you can do something automatically
    and effortlessly. That’s so valuable. It’s very rare that a new tool has a feature
    that’s more valuable than your old habit.</p><p>Many productivity reviews say
    the opposite. They say you should definitely try the newest and latest thing.</p><p>They’re
    wrong. If you have a habit based around an old tool, then you should be unapologetic
    about sticking with that tool.</p><p>If any programmers are reading this, a good
    tool to examine would be your text editor. I alternate between Sublime and Vim.
    I want to be a Sublime user, but my muscle memory around Vim shortcuts is so good
    that I still find I’m much more productive in Vim which was publicly released
    in 1991 and which I’ve been using since 1996.</p><h3>#6. Optimize for deep work
    &amp; deep learning</h3><p>I’m strongly influenced by Cal Newport’s book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X47ZVXM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1&?tag=coachtony-20">Deep
    Work</a> and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics-ebook/dp/B000W94FE6/?tag=coachtony-20">Flow</a>.</p><p>Cal
    comes from the perspective of deep work often being your most productive and valuable
    work. Mihaly’s research was actually just focused on happiness. Deep work is when
    people report the deepest levels of satisfaction.</p><p>Both of them recognize
    how difficult it is to do deep work or deep learning. Those moments don’t come
    by accident, and when they do, they are easily disrupted.</p><p>A lot of the advice
    in this article is meant to make it just a little bit easier for you to focus,
    to get into flow, and to achieve deep thinking and deep accomplishments. The main
    strategies are to eliminate interruptions, replace shallow behaviors with deeper
    ones (reading vs. tweeting), and schedule leisure activities and shallow activities
    so that they don’t interfere with your deep work.</p><h3>#6. Yes, your phone does
    impact your longevity</h3><p>By default, your phone is set up to create anxiety.
    I referenced a study about <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20120731/mild-anxiety-may-shorten-persons-life">how
    mild anxiety leads to increased mortality</a> twice in this article.</p><p>You
    paid too much for your iPhone to let it kill you — that’s an outrageous side effect.
    So instead, eliminate the anxiety.</p><p>I gave a few examples of how your phone
    can change your diet and activity patterns in order to help you live longer. Use

    D: Updates</h2><p>Do you have anything to add or correct in this article? Let
    me know and I’ll make an update.</p><ul><li><p>October 13, 2018: Added a strategy
    to create affirmation-style wallpapers in Instagram Stories and then rotate them
    through your Lockscreen. Credit to <a href="undefined">Jonathan Howard</a>.</p></li><li><p>October
    16, 2018: One, otherwise very smart, reader suggested dropping Evernote in favor
    of Google’s Keep app given that I’m all-in on Google Cloud everywhere else. Unfortunately
    for Keep, it’s built with rigid note types that don’t let you insert todo-list
    items into a regular note. That makes it ill-suited for Interstitial Journaling.</p></li><li><p>October
    16, 2018: A number of people pushed me to try <a href="https://superhuman.com/">Superhuman</a>
    as a GMail client. It’s currently invite-only, so I’m not going to make it the
    default advice yet. In early testing, I think their unsubscribe feature fits neatly
    with my advice to get hands on about what email you receive rather than hoping
    that other people’s algorithms filter it correctly. Their unsubscribe feature
    works with a simple keyboard shortcut and then takes the best available unsubscribe
    route, which ranges from clicking the unsubscribe link to just blocking the sender.</p></li><li><p>October
    17, 2018: On Twitter, <a href="undefined">Lucas Diez</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasgdiez/status/1052758942865117184">made
    the case</a> that anger toward an AI is a sign you should go to a therapist and
    also that it would be better to leave Siri with a female voice so you can address
    your anger/bias problems head on. I think gendered behavior toward an AI is common
    and socially implanted, and that you should start by just being aware of it. That’s
    not to say you shouldn’t go to a therapist — more I’m predicting that you should
    go to a therapist because you actually have much bigger problems that a therapist
    would help with. I am sympathetic to the idea of addressing your bias head on
    and just learning to treat the Siri’s and Alexa’s of the world with polite respect.
    I’d love to hear more from other people about the case for a female voice.</p></li><li><p>October

    and some of the responses below poked the whole idea of the Google cloud. Here
    are a couple additional notes. Moving to the Google cloud is generally not more
    valuable than your existing habits. If you have a system you like that uses other
    services, then stay put with those services. Moving to the Google cloud does trade
    privacy for productivity. Google will use your data to advertise to you. However,
    this is a productivity article. If you wish it were a privacy article, then <a
    href="https://protonmail.com/">use Protonmail</a>. Last, it’s not consistent that
    I have you turn off Apple’s ad tracking while then making yourself fully available
    to Google’s ad tracking. This is a tradeoff. You can turn off Apple’s tracking
    with zero downside, so do it. With Google, I think it’s worthwhile to use their
    services and then fight ads in other places. The Reader feature in Safari basically
    hides most Google ads that you’d see on your phone. On your computer, try an ad
    blocker.</p></li><li><p>October 18, 2018: Reddit suggested <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a>
    over Evernote. This is a very good suggestion and is, I think, a close call. Bear
    appears better in every respect but one. The don’t make any versions for non-Apple
    products. Evernote is so key to me, that I want it available on times when I happen
    to have gone Linux, Windows or Android. Over the last ten years, I’ve only been
    a 90% user of Apple products. However, if you are confident that you’ll be a 100%
    user of Apple products, Bear looks better than Evernote.</p></li><li><p>October
    22, 2018: Reader <a href="undefined">Steven Zhang</a> pointed me to <a href="undefined">John
    Zeratsky</a>’s <a href="https://medium.com/time-dorks/distractions-are-a-nuisance-but-infinity-pools-are-the-real-problem-e84122d62c0c">concept
    of Infinity Pools</a>: “always-on, effectively infinite sources of information
    and entertainment.” I think this is an excellent, maybe superior, description
    of what I was called “slot machines” in the sections above.</p></li><li><p>October
    22, 2018: Several readers asked about using Apple’s Keychain instead of a third-party
    password manager. I thought <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3060630/ios/why-not-pick-keychain-instead-of-1password-or-lastpass.html">this
    Macworld article covered the answer pretty well</a>. One of many convincing points
    against Keychain:</p><blockquote><p>But while [Keychain is] broadly useful in
    OS X, as more developers have adopted it and there’s Keychain Access for direct
    lookups and retrieval, in iOS you have to drill down to Settings &gt; Safari &gt;
    Passwords to view, edit, or (swipe all the way to the bottom) add passwords. <strong>Further,
    you can’t invoke Keychain in Apple’s non-Web login dialogs, making it useless
    for common purposes.</strong> And while you can make up a password when you need
    one, it’s awkward to get to and can only be retrieved easily on a corresponding
    Web page.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>December 7, 2018: A few readers asked me
    about the Shortcuts app which allows for you to do some custom scripting of steps
    on your iPhone. The best place to hear about shortcuts that other people are writing
    is on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts">shortcuts subreddit</a>.
    You may have noticed during this article that I was a stickler for trying to find
    advice that had been tested. Since shortcuts were knew when I published this,
    I hadn’t yet found anyone that was definitely using the feature productively.
    I’m actually still in that situation — the feature sounds promising, but I want
    to see that verified in the wild (possibly by you responding with your own use
    case).</p></li></ul>'

  :title: Focus and Deep Work — Your Secret Weapons to Becoming a 10X Developer
  :content: "<p>“Woman getting s*** done” by rawpixel on Unsplash</p><p><strong>Or
    how to become one of those highly-paid “10x Rockstar Ninja” developers companies
    love to hire.</strong></p><p>It doesn’t matter if you’re working on a side hustle
    or if you’re a junior developer wanting to get noticed and promoted. It doesn’t
    matter if you’re a lead developer looking for a change of pace, from a corporate
    gig to a start-up or the other way around. It doesn’t matter if you’re jobless
    out of college.</p><p>As long as you’re a programmer, no skill is more important
    to your success than focused, deep work.</p><p>From Cal Newport’s book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2NXMePw\">Deep
    Work</a>:</p><blockquote><h1>*<em>“The Deep Work Hypothesis: *</em>The ability
    to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare and at the exact same time
    it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. … the few who cultivate this
    skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.”</h1><h1>—
    <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2NXMePw\">Deep Work</a> p.14</h1></blockquote><p>I’m
    going to use some points from Deep Work to tie together my thoughts on becoming
    a successful, in-demand developer. I highly recommend reading it if you’re in
    the technology field in any capacity.</p><h2>From Fear of Code to Lead Developer.</h2><p>I’m
    a self-taught programmer. But I didn’t start programming until my late 20s. I’ve
    always considered myself an artistic person and figured I’d end up in a creative
    field.</p><p>And I did. After college I started a company that did graphics and
    web design for small, local businesses. I was a pro at Photoshop and knew enough
    HTML and CSS to be dangerous.</p><p>But anything more complicated, requiring even
    a line of PHP, I had to outsource.</p><p>I was petrified of code for a very long
    time and left it to the folks with Computer Science degrees.</p><p>“One wrong
    keystroke and the client’s business could go up in flames…” I thought. I wasn’t
    too far off honestly (in the days before version control, there was no turning
    back with FTP).</p><p>Now I’m a lead developer for a Fortune 50 company working
    on a product that entertains millions of people every month.</p><p>How’d I get
    here in a few short years? \U0001F914</p><p>My “secret” is getting good at focus
    and deep work. There’s nothing special about me. I took the time to train myself
    how to focus on one specific thing, without distraction, for an extended period
    of time.</p><h2>Code is Art.</h2><p>Programming is very much a creative pursuit.</p><p>It
    may seem technical and dry to a regular person, but you <em>are</em> a creator.
    You’re creating something out of nothing. That “nothing” can be an idea in your
    head for an app or a feature request from a product manager.</p><p>That thing
    doesn’t exist yet, but you’re going to bring it to life. Not with paint or words,
    but with code (OK, <em>some</em> words, as long as they’re not reserved words).</p><p>If
    you have any desire to produce at a high level, then you have to practice.</p><p>The
    quantity and quality of your output increases when you get better at being able
    to stay focused for longer, intentional periods.</p><p>Art, music, and writing
    all require long periods of uninterrupted time where the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin\">myelin</a>
    thickens on those synapses between your brain cells. Programming is no different.</p><p>You
    get better with practice and time. And you can get a lot better, in less time,
    when you make your practice more effective.</p><h2>Yes, You Can Be a 10x Developer
    (But 5x, 2x and 1x Are Great Too)</h2><p>Let me preface this by saying that I
    hate buzzwords like “rockstar” “ninja” and “10x developer.” Every developer does,
    but companies and recruiters love to use them.</p><p>Despite the cheesiness, there
    is a lot of truth behind the “10x Developer” idea.</p><p>It doesn’t mean that
    one person can replace ten. It means that some developers get more done, with
    better quality, and in less time. They do it consistently over the long run without
    working any harder than anyone else.</p><p>This ability is <strong>not</strong>
    a natural gift. You aren’t born with it and it’s not something you can “turn on.”
    It’s a skill that <strong>you can, and must, practice and train</strong>.</p><p>I’ve
    been on the hiring side dozens of times and I will tell you any company would
    love to have an entire team of 10x developers. But that’s not reality.</p><p>There
    are more open developer jobs than there are qualified developers to fill them.
    Businesses are having trouble filling positions with *any *qualified developers,
    let alone (some multiplier)x developers.</p><blockquote><h1>“Senior executives
    believe that the lack of quality developer talent is one of the biggest potential
    threats to their growth.” - <a href=\"https://stripe.com/reports/developer-coefficient-2018\">The
    Developer Coefficient</a></h1></blockquote><p>It’s <strong>hard</strong> to find
    good talent.</p><p>Most companies will knock down the door for a 10x developer
    but they’re happy hiring 5x, 2x, and even 1x developers.</p><p>A 1x developer
    (yes, I made this up) is a developer who can do the job they’re hired to do. Nothing
    more, nothing less. Seriously. Any company will be delighted with that. Plenty
    has been written about the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=how+much+does+a+bad+hire+cost\">astronomical
    cost of a bad hire</a>.</p><h2>The 2 Steps You Need to Multiply Your Programming
    Skills with Focus and Deep Work</h2><p>It’s time to step up your career. There’s
    so much opportunity for you to get hired and thrive in a career you love.</p><p>If
    you’re the entrepreneurial type, the same lessons apply. More so because your
    livelihood depends on being effective with your time.</p><p>This is how you go
    from junior to senior developer. This is how you go from 0.5x developer to 5x
    developer. This is how you get your side project off the ground when you only
    have a 10 hours a week to work on it.</p><p>Hell, this is how you* survive.*</p><blockquote><h1>“To
    remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly
    learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don’t cultivate
    this ability, you’re likely to fall behind as technology advances.”</h1><h1>—
    <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2NXMePw\">Deep Work</a> p.13</h1></blockquote><h3>Learning
    to Focus is HARD.</h3><p>The first thing to realize is that learning to focus
    isn’t easy. You’re not going to be able to start producing novels of quality code
    from the start. Especially if you’ve never dealt with the reality of how easily
    distracted you are.</p><p>Learning to focus requires practice. Anything that requires
    practice means its difficult. If it wasn’t, you’d be good at it by default.</p><p>You’re
    going to struggle and that’s OK. We’ll start small.</p><h3><strong>Don’t Confuse
    Busyness with Productivity.</strong></h3><p>Deep work is not locking yourself
    in a dark room and forcing yourself to aimlessly navigate code for 14 hours at
    a time. Just because you’re doing <em>something</em> doesn’t mean it’s worth doing.</p><p>You
    need to figure out what’s important and what’s not. That’s beyond the scope of
    this post. If you’re going to spend the time learning how to focus, then do it
    on something that has a high return for the effort involved.</p><p>It’s like the
    sun and a magnifying glass.</p><p>Distracted work is your energy going in every
    direction like the sun. You can stand outside in the sun and you’re not going
    to get hurt.</p><p>Learn to concentrate that scattered energy with a magnifying
    glass and your ability to destroy goes from 0 to 10. We want to preserve that
    limited power for important things (the sun goes down eventually).</p><h2>Step
    1 — Removing Distraction</h2><p>Multitasking is a lie. You’re fooling yourself
    if you think you can write quality code while checking Slack messages or reading
    news in another window.</p><p>We live in a world of distraction. The technology
    we work on is a double-edged sword. There’s nothing like that sweet, sweet dopamine
    hit from a new notification.</p><p>“Cool, someone liked that I saw Hamilton.”
    But that’s poison to your ability to focus.</p><p><strong>Removing distraction
    is the foundation of focused, deep work.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Put your
    phone on silent</strong> or turn it off if you’re not in a position that has to
    be on-call. I use the <a href=\"https://www.forestapp.cc/en/\">Forest app</a>
    to prevent me from going on my phone. Face down, somewhere out of arm’s reach
    is good too.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Close Slack. *</em>This is a huge one for me
    because I have this OCD where I need to clear my queue of unread messages. Most
    of these messages are noise so its better for me to close Slack when working.</p></li><li><p><strong>Close
    any other apps</strong> that are going to distract you with notifications, like
    Outlook.</p></li><li><p>This is the hardest one of all — <strong>close any browser
    windows</strong> not relevant to your task. Now <strong>block all your favorite
    websites</strong>. I love the <a href=\"https://heyfocus.com\">HeyFocus app</a>
    ($20) but there are a bunch of free extensions out there.</p></li><li><p><strong>Headphones
    on</strong> — This keeps people from bothering you <em>(hopefully),</em> but also
    listening to the same album over and over is a great focusing tool. It might be
    a priming thing (signaling to your brain that its time to work) or a flow thing
    (the music puts you in a good mood). Either way, a lot of developers swear by
    this technique.</p></li></ul><h2>Step 2 — Pomodoro Technique (The Secret Weapon)</h2><p><img

    you have a panic attack thinking that you can’t go 8 hours without any distractions,
    don’t worry. We’ll be using the Pomodoro Technique to break up our day.</p><p>There
    are a lot of productivity techniques out there, but my favorite has been the Pomodoro.
    I’m going to paraphrase it below to get you started.</p><p>If you want the official
    rundown, check out <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2DhkHob\">The Pomodoro Technique</a>
    book, which gets more detailed and rule-oriented.</p><h3>Work for a 25 Minute
    Block (a Pomodoro)</h3><p>You’ll work for 25 minutes, undistracted, on one thing.
    That chunk of work is a one “Pomodoro.”</p><p>Use a Timer. I’ve used an <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Dj7vPo\">old
    school hourglass</a> before. If you want to be a true Pomodoro aficionado, then
    use a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2pr6X09\">tomato timer</a>.</p><h3>Then Take a
    5 Minute Break</h3><p>It is imperative that you walk away when its break time.
    Grab some water. Browse Hacker News. Go to the bathroom. Whatever it is, work
    is over. Disconnect from work completely.</p><h3>One Task Only in a Pomodoro</h3><p>This
    can be fixing a bug, planning out a new feature, or starting a video series to
    learn a new framework.</p><p>If the task is too big (like “make an app”) then
    you have to break it down into smaller chunks that take roughly 25 minutes.</p><p>Some
    tasks need several Pomodoros to complete. It might take three Pomodoros to code
    a feature and two more to write the tests.</p><p>Or you might need to batch similar,
    small tasks into a Pomodoro (ex — reply on 5 JIRA tickets).</p><p>The point is
    that the task, or tasks, have to be one “type” of work.</p><p>As an aside, the
    main reason we procrastinate is because we get overwhelmed by huge, insurmountable
    tasks. If your goal is to “Write a Book” you’ll never do it. When you break it
    out into smaller chunks like “Write an outline” or “Write 300 words” then the
    path becomes clearer. Starting is easier, and doable.</p><p>While this post has
    been about becoming a better developer, not procrastination, the truth is that
    many times they are the same thing.</p><h3>Work Without Distraction</h3><p>See
    Step 1. If you get distracted, the Pomodoro doesn’t count and you have to start
    over.</p><h3>Work Your Way Up to 25 Minutes</h3><p>25 minutes might be hard for
    you if you’ve never done this before. Start with 10 minutes and work your way
    up from there. Next one would be 15, then 20, then 25.</p><p>You can work your
    way up to 55-minute blocks when you really get good at this.</p><h3>Work Your
    Way Up to Multiple Pomodoros Per Day</h3><p>The first time you try distraction-free
    work, 25 minutes in a day might be all you can handle. That’s fine. Keep working
    your way up by adding a little each day.</p><h2>How Does This Make Me a Better
    Developer?</h2><p>Let’s be real. You’re not helping your career by jumping from
    your code editor to a chatroom to an email to a real-life conversation.</p><p>You
    *might look and feel *busy, and you might even ship some code once in a while.</p><p>But
    the fact is that a few hours of undistracted, deep work produces more quantity
    and quality than a full day of scattered, distracted work.</p><p>Start with one
    Pomodoro. Eventually you’ll be able to chain a few Pomodoros together.</p><p>Then
    you’ll chain a few days of Pomodoros together.</p><p>Then weeks and months.</p><p>You’ll
    find its easier to get into a flow state, and it will happen more often.</p><p>This
    is <strong>gold</strong>. This is when you have those “eureka” moments and breakthroughs.</p><p>This
    is when the hard thing that’s been kicking your ass becomes easy.</p><p><strong>This
    is when your coding skills level up exponentially.</strong></p><p>The demand for
    good, qualified programmers is higher than ever. The surest path to success is
    getting into the ritual of deep, focused work.</p><p>Try it out and let me know
    what you think. If you have other productivity techniques, post them below!</p><h3>Before
    You Go —</h3><p>I appreciate all of the love that this article is getting. There’s
    no better way to support me than to give me a follow on Medium (<a href=\"undefined\">Bar
    Franek</a>). It lets me know that I should write more!</p><p>Did you know that

  :title: What are people working on in coffee shops?
  :content: '<p>Almost every day I sit down in a coffee shop in Venice, California,
    to work on AboutTheStart.com.</p><blockquote><h1>I always wonder what everyone
    else is doing.</h1></blockquote><p>So this Tuesday around 12:30 pm, my friend
    <a href="http://andrewparr.com">Andrew</a> and I decided to ask everyone at the
    <a href="http://deuscustoms.com/cafes/venice/">Deus Ex Machina</a> coffee shop
    what they were doing <strong>at that exact moment</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*r02q17GGCoyh3JyjNnqoDA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>As you would imagine, getting out of your chair and interrupting
    every person you see hard at work is a pretty scary idea and enough to make you
    doubt if it’s even worth doing.</p><p>As a matter of fact, Andrew, who really
    liked the idea initially, didn’t want to do it once we were at the coffee shop.</p><p>Once
    he saw that the first few people I talked to seemed to be delighted by our experiment,
    he grabbed his notepad and started asking questions as well <em>(we included a
    surprising note on our experiment at the end of this article).</em></p><p>Nearly
    everyone we talked to told us that they too had always wondered what everyone
    else was doing.</p><p>We thought it would be nice to share our findings with you.
    Here’s a selection of answers:</p><blockquote><h1>I’m a <strong>production designer</strong>
    currently doing location scouting for a film. I’ve been driving around taking
    pictures and stopped here to create PDFs with the various locations I’ve found.</h1><h1>I’m
    a lifestyle and portrait photographer. I come here to do edits. I work better
    around people.</h1><h1>I’m a student who also started a non-profit to get grants
    for acrobatic gymnasts who need money for training.</h1><h1>I’m currently helping
    my friend with his bio.</h1></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*3Ba5E39bH_MWE4TqXWsZAQ.png"
    alt=""></p><blockquote><h1>I’m a writer, but I’m working on a construction project
    for a building I own in Venice, dealing with my contractors.</h1><h1>I’m messaging
    friends.</h1><h1>I work in tech, and I basically never work in coffee shops.</h1><h1>I’m
    writing a creative brief (I’m in music marketing). I feel inspired around other
    people.</h1></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*GAUaLVu_6T2yPkAmVE24og.png"
    alt=""></p><blockquote><h1>I’m a musician and I’m currently invoicing for royalties.</h1><h1>I’m
    writing a treatment.</h1><h1><em>(Note: a treatment typically is the step between
    scene cards and the first draft of a screenplay for a motion picture, television
    program, or radio play.)</em></h1><h1>I’m a creative director writing a pitch
    for a new client (an advertising account).</h1></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Zpm5tQa7O3_foTj08geUEQ.jpeg"

    to connect with all these people who were previously part of the background. We

  :title: An Ambitious Person’s Brutally Honest Take On Work-Life Balance
  :content: '<p>Photo Credit: Evan Kirby</p><h3>We hit rock bottom. Now, we’re happily
    married 12 years. Here’s what I learned.</h3><p>Jim was both a serial entrepreneur
    and a serial husband.</p><p>*<em>In his early 60s, he was on his sixth wife and
    third company. *</em>He was about 70 pounds overweight.</p><p>I happened to sit
    next him for dinner at an entrepreneurship conference. At age 28, I had just become
    a father, and I asked him a deep question that I was struggling with. “You have
    a 70-million-dollar company. Looking back, could you have been a better husband
    and parent and still built such a successful company?”</p><p>His answer was both
    short and shocking: “Can a woman be half pregnant?”</p><p>I smiled politely and
    gave an uncomfortable laugh. In my head, I thought to myself, “Bullshit! I will
    prove you wrong!”</p><p>That was nine years ago. Today, my daughter is 9, and
    my son is 7. Looking back on that night, my conclusion can be summed up in three
    words:</p><h2>Jim was right.</h2><p>“So this is how a marriage ends.”</p><p>That’s
    what went through my mind, five years after that conversation with Jim, as I hung
    up the phone in my hotel room after a lifeless conversation with my wife and business
    partner Sheena.</p><p>The idea that two people who were “meant for each other”
    could just grow apart never seemed like a suitable cause of separation. But now
    I was living the possibility of it, and I understood.</p><p>At some level, I longed
    for the arguments of the past, which would at least confirm that we both still
    cared. But willpower no longer worked as a way to create emotion. For the first
    time in the 13 years that I’d been with Sheena, I was losing hope. I was scared.</p><p>This
    phone call happened immediately after a five-month sprint in which Sheena and
    I worked seven days a week to meet an impossible business deadline. Everything
    else in our life suffered: our health, our relationship, our parenting, our sleep.
    Each of us had aged three years in three months and we could see it in the other.
    In order to recover and get through the days with energy, I didn’t need one nap,
    I needed two. It was our low point as a couple and my low point as an individual.
    We were so busy we couldn’t even argue. Disappointment turned into anger, which
    turned into apathy.</p><p>When things fall apart, there are two ways to get back
    up:</p><ol><li><p>Try to rebuild the life you had before.</p></li><li><p>Let go
    of who you were and become something new that you had never imagined before.</p></li></ol><p>I
    chose the second path. So did my wife.</p><p>I remember us taking long walks in
    the woods, having multi-hour conversations, and journaling daily. I read books
    about how others confronted loss, so I could learn how to let go and live. These
    books included <a href="http://amzn.to/2tRCdub">How We Die: Reflections of Life’s
    Final Chapter</a>, in which a surgeon shared a behind-the-scenes perspective of
    patients’ final days. I also read <a href="http://amzn.to/2pgP9Vc">Chasing Daylight:
    How My Forthcoming Death Transformed My Life</a> by the former CEO of KPMG, Eugene
    O’Kelly. I was shocked to learn how, after decades of working long hours, O’Kelly
    quickly and with no regrets shuttered all ties with KPMG upon learning of his
    terminal diagnosis. I also read books about spouses losing spouses and parents
    losing children.</p><p>My loss, of course, could not compare to actual death,
    but on an unconscious level I knew that part of me was dying. I felt real grief
    for the loss of goals I had been committed to for more than a decade, networks
    I had been a part of that no longer represented how I thought of myself, values
    that no longer served me, and beliefs about myself I no longer wanted. The period
    ended with both Sheena and I making serious changes to who we spent time with,
    how we managed our health, who we chose as role models, how we parented, and how
    we conducted our relationship.</p><p>For example, I took a deep dive into health.
    As a result, I learned that I had mild sleep apnea, a gluten allergy, and a vitamin
    D deficiency. I started tracking my physical movement, exercising regularly, and
    sleeping more. Sheena took a year off of working to be full-time with our son
    after he had to transfer out of two preschools and had become mute in any school
    environment.</p><p>I’m now proud Sheena and I have been together for 18 years
    and married for 12. We’re more financially secure than ever. Our son is thriving
    in a perfect program for him. And we love what we do on a day-to-day basis because
    it is deeply, intrinsically rewarding. Finally, we can both honestly say that
    the relationship is better than it’s ever been.</p><p>Jim was right because being
    great at something, to truly be one of the best in the world in a professional
    context, typically requires an ungodly amount of commitment over decades. It requires
    rising to and overcoming every challenge. This commitment often comes at a cost:
    to building friendships, to a deep relationship with your spouse, to your health,
    to your children, and to whatever else requires time and energy.</p><p>Ambition
    can become a vacuum that sucks in everything in its path. It’s what you think
    about in the shower, on your commute, or during any idle moment. I’ve read more
    than a hundred biographies of elite performers and have yet to find one who was
    not consumed with being world-class to the point of obsession and who didn’t reorient
    their life around their craft. I did not take Jim seriously nine years ago. That
    was a mistake.</p><h2>But Jim was wrong, too.</h2><p>Earlier this year, the wife
    of my partner and investor, Eben Pagan, sent an email that changed my life. She
    wrote:</p><blockquote><p>Every leader Eben invests in works with me to support
    the whole system working and succeeding. So we offer it as a contribution to your
    family dynamic feeling smoother and softer. When you and Sheena know how to find
    each other in difficult times, it only adds to your success in business.How does
    next week Tuesday sound?Much love, Annie</p></blockquote><p>Since then, I’ve talked
    weekly with <a href="http://annielalla.com/">Annie Lalla</a>, who happens to be
    a brilliant relationship coach, and those conversations have shown me that Jim
    was also wrong. One day as I was telling Annie about the difficulties of parenting,
    I realized that what I was actually doing was <em>resisting</em> being a parent.
    When challenges came up I thought to myself, “Arghh. Why is this happening? I
    can’t believe I have to deal with this.” I also realized that I had unconsciously
    accepted that I wasn’t ever going to be a great parent.</p><p>As I shared these
    thoughts with Annie — thoughts I hadn’t even been aware of just minutes prior
    — she asked me, “Why can’t you do both?”</p><p>“Here we go,” I thought to myself.
    “Where do I start?” I told her about Jim. I told her about the biographies. I
    told her about the low point in our marriage when I was trying to have it all.
    I told her that I didn’t really think it was possible.</p><p>But she pushed back.
    “That was in the past! You aren’t the same as you were five years ago. You have
    new experiences and lessons learned. And society isn’t the same either. There
    are new tools there, too. Right?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You are someone who likes
    to pioneer, right?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Society needs pioneering men like you
    who find new ways to balance and blend career and family. You can be a role model
    for the next generation.”</p><p>In the movie <em>Inception</em>, a group of agents
    plant thoughts in people’s heads while they’re dreaming. Those thoughts can grow,
    change the whole constellation of that person’s beliefs, and alter their decisions
    when they awaken. In that moment, I felt like I had been incepted.</p><p>Annie’s
    suggestion took hold. Nine years after that conversation with Jim, knowing what
    I know now, I began to believe I could do it differently. But I wondered <em>how</em>.</p><p>The
    answer I’ve come to for myself is what I call the Snowball Principle.</p><h2>The
    Snowball Principle And How To Have It All</h2><p>The Snowball Principle is the
    idea that we can have it all if we’re willing to:</p><ol><li><p>Get the fundamentals
    right FIRST and make them non-negotiable.</p></li><li><p>Have Big, Hairy, Audacious
    Goals (BHAGS), but be patient with them.</p></li><li><p>Replace all-or-nothing
    sprints with a marathon mentality.</p></li></ol><p>It’s the idea that if we<a

    do the right things consistently over a long period of time</a>, the future we
    want becomes more and more inevitable because our actions <a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/why-successful-people-spend-10-hours-a-week-on-compound-time-79d64d8132a8">compound
    upon one another</a>.</p><p>Just as a small snowball being rolled down the hill
    slowly picks up snow with each rotation and becomes a huge one:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*6VXzhjupcyOLZCCg."

    2009 world record for largest domino collapse ever.</strong></p><p>With both the
    snowball and the dominoes, the ending is inevitable.</p><p>One of my role models
    for the Snowball Principle happens to be one of my closest friends since high
    school. Cal Newport and I founded a company together when we were 16 years old.
    Over the years, one thing I’ve noticed about Cal is that he is incredibly consistent
    at what he commits to.</p><p>Cal wrote his first book while he was in college,
    and he has devoted a small amount of time to writing almost each weekday since
    then. As a result, over the last 16 years, he has:</p><ul><li><p>Written <a href="https://amzn.to/2s1bsQO">six
    bestselling books</a></p></li><li><p>Earned a computer science PhD from MIT</p></li><li><p>Obtained
    a tenured professorship at Georgetown</p></li><li><p>Become a father of three</p></li></ul><p>But
    wait, here’s the real cincher: He does all this while consistently shutting off
    work at 5 p.m. daily and taking weekends off.</p><p>I remember being skeptical
    of Cal’s approach when we were in our 20s. Why not just jump 100 percent into
    one thing? Why shut down work at 5 p.m. when you don’t have kids and you can fill
    up that time? I remember Cal once saying that his brain would only allow him to
    do about five hours of truly deep work per day. The first word that came to my
    mind was “lazy.”</p><p>After seeing Cal’s results compound, I’ve turned from a
    skeptic into a believer. After observing my own body’s energy when I do <a href="https://amzn.to/2Lp9H7X">deep
    and focused work,</a> I discovered that 5 hours per day is about right.</p><p>The
    chart below explains what I missed about the power of Cal’s approach. In the beginning
    of earning compound interest, you don’t see the <a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/why-successful-people-spend-10-hours-a-week-on-compound-time-79d64d8132a8">benefits
    of compounding</a>. Your results in the beginning are tightly correlated with
    your effort, but, by the end, the interest is doing almost all of the work for
    you.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*HwRS3Y1wwUPJSpXv."

    is a breakdown on each of the components of the Snowball Principle…</p><h2>Key
    #1: Get the fundamentals right FIRST and make them non-negotiable.</h2><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*g963qsYCJ4mLfDBP." alt=""></p><p>We
    are all human. And as humans, we have very similar psychological and physiological
    needs. There are six core areas that, barring some really bad luck, can essentially
    guarantee us a pretty good life if we get them to a sufficient level:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Health:</strong>
    Living a long life filled with vibrant energy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wealth:</strong>
    Accumulating enough money to live your ideal, sufficient lifestyle without worrying
    about the future.</p></li><li><p><strong>Relationships:</strong> Building a large,
    diverse, loving network of relationships with people you feel connected to.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Work:
    *</em>Having a job where you can work on your strengths and passion in a way that
    gives you autonomy, connection, and purpose.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Learning and
    Growth: *</em>Investing in the knowledge and skills that help you solve challenges
    in your life and career now and <a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/be-prepared-to-lose-your-job-in-the-future-if-you-dont-learn-this-one-skill-now-8a87ade2a268">into
    the future</a>.</p></li><li><p>**Purpose: <a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/if-you-dont-want-to-regret-your-life-30-years-later-make-this-one-choice-right-now-1cc137516df0">**Living
    a life full of meaning that matters</a>.</p></li></ol><p>These six needs are so
    intertwined that your degree of success in one either holds you back or multiplies
    your results in each of the other areas.</p><p>For example, if you have great
    health, but your relationships are full of conflict, you’ll feel unhappy. If you
    have great and loving relationships, but you’re deep in debt with creditors calling
    you all day, you’ll feel totally stressed out. Even if you’re rich and you have
    the wealth that everyone wants, it doesn’t mean much if you’re ill and bedridden.</p><p>Now
    flip this around, and look at it from the opposite perspective. Think about the
    opportunity of improving in each area rather than the costs of falling short.
    If you have great health, and your relationships are full of conflict, but you
    repair your relationships, think about how much better your life becomes. It’s
    not just a little better, right?** It’s a multiplier.** If you have good relationships
    but you’re stressed out about being in debt, and then you pay your debt off, think
    about how good that feels. Again, it’s not just a little better. <strong>It’s
    a multiplier.</strong></p><p>If we get all these six pillars right, we have a
    good life by almost anyone’s standard. But if even one of them are off, the whole
    thing is thrown.</p><p><strong>In retrospect, I would have focused on getting
    these fundamentals right FIRST, before setting huge professional goals with lower
    probabilities of success. I would’ve made things like getting an annual physical
    with blood work, a good night’s sleep, and adequate exercise non-negotiables.
    By non-negotiable, I mean not even entertaining excuses about urgent deadlines
    or it not being the right timing. Instead, I focused on my big, hairy, audacious
    goals first and justified sacrificing the fundamentals.</strong></p><p>The beautiful
    thing about meeting our physical and psychological needs is that they are more
    basic and doable than Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals. It doesn’t require lottery-level
    luck, 10,000 hours of deliberate practice, a certain IQ, or a particular net worth
    to strengthen your foundation. It just requires learning the basics of all of
    these needs and implementing a few habits that you do every single day to meet
    them. Difficult, but not impossible.</p><p>There are several epidemics happening
    in society at once: loneliness, obesity, depression, anxiety, and suicide. These
    epidemics not only impact the individuals who experience them, but their families,
    the government, and society at large. I can’t help but think that focusing on
    the fundamentals first would have a large impact on us not only as individuals
    but on a society as a whole.</p><p>Research is showing that many of these problems
    can be significantly reduced by getting a <a href="https://amzn.to/2L22ppV">good
    night’s sleep</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Jbzpif">exercising regularly</a>,
    <a href="https://www.foundmyfitness.com">eating a healthy diet</a>, and <a href="https://amzn.to/2L6kKlw">putting
    aside time for friends and family</a>.</p><h2>Key #2: Have Big, Hairy, Audacious
    Goals (BHAGS), but be patient with them.</h2><p>I still have big goals that I’m
    pursuing, but I’m pursuing them on<a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/im-36-and-i-just-realized-a-timeless-truth-i-missed-all-this-time-dafcfd2344b6">
    a different timescale</a>.</p><p>In my 20s, I focused on accomplishing certain
    goals by the time I was 30. Because of these arbitrary time limits, I had to focus
    more on my business and rush. As a result, Sheena and I hit milestones like BusinessWeek’s
    25 Under 25 and Inc.’s 30 Under 30 awards, and made over $1 million in revenue
    by the time we turned 30.</p><p>However, at 36 years old, I <a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/im-36-and-i-just-realized-a-timeless-truth-i-missed-all-this-time-dafcfd2344b6">don’t
    really care about these goals</a>, and I wonder why I sacrificed so much for them.</p><p>In
    retrospect, I should have tried less to keep up with other entrepreneurs’ revenue
    numbers and awards, and focused more on achieving goals that created value over
    time rather than goals that just sounded good.</p><p>Patience is hard, because
    it means putting off goals until further in the future. It means seeing peers
    pass you by in certain domains where they are 100-percent laser-focused. It means
    focusing on internal metrics rather than external metrics. It means <a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/if-you-want-to-be-massively-successful-do-not-set-ambitious-goals-according-to-studies-affa9cd39f5d">learning
    to appreciate the journey</a>.</p><p>Granted, there are certain businesses where
    speed is everything. But, when I look back on my own businesses, I see that the
    urgency I felt was more in my mind than anywhere else.</p><h2>Key #3: Replace
    all-or-nothing sprints with a marathon mentality.</h2><blockquote><h1><em>When
    asked what surprised him about humanity the most, the Dalai Lama replied:</em></h1><h1><em>“Man.
    Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money
    to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does
    not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or
    the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never
    really lived.”</em></h1></blockquote><p>Einstein famously said that compound interest
    is the eighth wonder of the world. Oddly, few people actually take advantage of
    this insight. Tens of millions of more people could be millionaires at retirement
    if they consistently saved small amounts of money starting when they were young.
    People could effectively be geniuses if they followed the <a href="https://medium.com/@michaeldsimmons/bill-gates-warren-buffett-and-oprah-all-use-the-5-hour-rule-308f528b6363">five-hour
    rule</a> and let knowledge compound upon itself by learning <a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/the-5-hour-rule-if-youre-not-spending-5-hours-per-week-learning-you-re-being-irresponsible-791c3f18f5e6">at
    least five hours per week</a>.</p><p>Yet few people actually do these things.</p><p>Why
    do we not do something that makes so much sense?</p><p>If I’m honest with myself
    and look back on my life, it comes down to the fact that I:</p><ol><li><p>Overvalued
    short-term sprints where I became focused on just one part of my life</p></li><li><p>Undervalued
    <a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/why-successful-people-spend-10-hours-a-week-on-compound-time-79d64d8132a8">the
    amazing compounding power of long-term habits</a></p></li></ol><p>It’s super compelling
    for the brain to think about what might happen if we just gave it our all financially
    and physically toward a goal for three months. But the reality is that <a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/if-you-want-to-be-massively-successful-do-not-set-ambitious-goals-according-to-studies-affa9cd39f5d">most
    goals always take longer</a> than we’d hope or expect and often were less important
    than we thought they were.</p><p>In the world of long-distance running, the idea
    of someone starting off a race by sprinting as fast as they can until they collapse
    from exhaustion is obviously stupid. Yet, when it comes to our careers, many of
    us follow this mentality.</p><p>Expert marathoners, on the other hand, purposely
    run slower than their full potential so that they can run longer and actually
    win the race.</p><p>We need to redefine hard work from how many hours we work
    in a week (the equivalent of our sprinting speed) to how how consistently hard
    we work over a long period of time.</p><h2>On Holistic Success</h2><p>In nine
    years, my firstborn will be an adult. The time has passed by so damn fast. Now
    I wonder to myself, “What kind of adults do I hope my children become?” In my
    career as an education entrepreneur, I wonder, “What do we want to train the next
    generation to be like?”</p><p>After going through my own personal transformation,
    my answer has changed.</p><p>We can all name numerous examples of billionaires,
    celebrities, and rock stars who achieved their big, hairy, audacious goals, but
    were personally miserable, sacrificed their health, sacrificed their family, or
    even sacrificed their morals.</p><p>And this misery isn’t limited to the individual
    realm. Just as we each suffer when we let ambition overtake our basic needs, we
    also suffer when we as a culture do the same. We see the environment being destroyed
    and morals being sacrificed by some of the most ambitious companies and people
    in our society. In the rush to release new technology before competitors, we see
    new technologies emerging, such as artificial intelligence, which may eventually
    have the power to wipe out humanity. Safety has become an afterthought.</p><p><strong>My
    hope for the next generation is that we get the fundamentals right first, both
    as individuals and as a society.</strong> My hope is that when we talk about success
    stories, we can move beyond overnight success stories or aha moments and talk
    more about the power of consistency over a long period of time.</p><p>When I was
    in my early twenties, I was constantly seeking out new, amazing experiences and
    concepts. Now, in my mid-thirties, I find that I’m <a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/while-everyone-is-distracted-by-social-media-successful-people-double-down-on-a-totally-underrated-5a86701e9a27">rediscovering
    old ideas</a> and seeing their value for the first time. Ideas like patience,
    focusing on the long term, and getting the fundamentals right aren’t complex or
    sexy. They aren’t the newest hack, but they are tried and true. They are the ideas
    that have been passed down through generations in stories like <em>The Tortoise
    and the Hare.</em></p><p>If we flip our priorities and focus first on the foundation,
    our BHAGs will be icing on the cake. Whether we achieve them or not, when we look
    back on our life, we’ll be able to say we lived <a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/if-you-dont-want-to-regret-your-life-30-years-later-make-this-one-choice-right-now-1cc137516df0">a

  :title: How does Ethereum work, anyway?
  :content: '<p>Source: r/ethereum</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Odds are you’ve heard
    about the Ethereum blockchain, whether or not you know what it is. It’s been in
    the news a lot lately, including the cover of some major magazines, but reading
    those articles can be like gibberish if you don’t have a foundation for what exactly
    Ethereum is. So what is it? In essence, a public database that keeps a permanent
    record of digital transactions. Importantly, this database doesn’t require any
    central authority to maintain and secure it. Instead it operates as a “trustless”
    transactional system — a framework in which individuals can make peer-to-peer
    transactions without needing to trust a third party OR one another.</p><p>Still
    confused? That’s where this post comes in. My aim is to explain how Ethereum functions
    at a technical level, without complex math or scary-looking formulas. Even if
    you’re not a programmer, I hope you’ll walk away with at least better grasp of
    the tech. If some parts are too technical and difficult to grok, that’s totally
    fine! There’s really no need to understand every little detail. I recommend just
    focusing on understanding things at a broad level.</p><p>Many of the topics covered
    in this post are a breakdown of the concepts discussed in the yellow paper. I’ve
    added my own explanations and diagrams to make understanding Ethereum easier.
    Those brave enough to take on the technical challenge can also read the Ethereum
    yellow paper.</p><p>Let’s get started!</p><h2>Blockchain definition</h2><p>A blockchain
    is a “<strong>cryptographically secure transactional singleton machine with shared-state.”
    **[1]</strong> **That’s a mouthful, isn’t it? Let’s break it down.</p><ul><li><p>*<em>“Cryptographically
    secure” *</em>means that the creation of digital currency is secured by complex
    mathematical algorithms that are obscenely hard to break. Think of a firewall
    of sorts. They make it nearly impossible to cheat the system (e.g. create fake
    transactions, erase transactions, etc.)</p></li><li><p><strong>“Transactional
    singleton machine”</strong> means that there’s a single canonical instance of
    the machine responsible for all the transactions being created in the system.
    In other words, there’s a single global truth that everyone believes in.</p></li><li><p><strong>“With
    shared-state”</strong> means that the state stored on this machine is shared and
    open to everyone.</p></li></ul><p>Ethereum implements this blockchain paradigm.</p><iframe
    src="https://medium.com/media/d064eece083fdc3fe9ef86974ce68e60" frameborder=0></iframe><h2>The
    Ethereum blockchain paradigm explained</h2><p>The Ethereum blockchain is essentially
    a <strong>transaction-based</strong> <strong>state machine</strong>. In computer
    science, a <em>state machine</em> refers to something that will read a series
    of inputs and, based on those inputs, will transition to a new state.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2536/1*HYjnPbo-_fqpgWhPHrmrow.png" alt=""></p><p>With
    Ethereum’s state machine, we begin with a “genesis state.” This is analogous to
    a blank slate, before any transactions have happened on the network. When transactions
    are executed, this genesis state transitions into some final state. At any point
    in time, this final state represents the current state of Ethereum.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2564/1*jZ-VRXBJtOnePofB0z2Q8A.png" alt=""></p><p>The
    state of Ethereum has millions of transactions. These transactions are grouped
    into “blocks.” A block contains a series of transactions, and each block is chained
    together with its previous block.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2344/1*l_H58_pGm3XGwGoQlO9FVQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>To cause a transition from one state to the next, a transaction
    must be valid. *<em>For a transaction to be considered valid, it must go through
    a validation process known as mining. *</em>Mining is when a group of nodes (i.e.
    computers) expend their compute resources to create a block of valid transactions.</p><p>Any
    node on the network that declares itself as a miner can attempt to create and
    validate a block. Lots of miners from around the world try to create and validate
    blocks at the same time. Each miner provides a mathematical “proof” when submitting
    a block to the blockchain, and this proof acts as a guarantee: if the proof exists,
    the block must be valid.</p><p>For a block to be added to the main blockchain,
    the miner must prove it faster than any other competitor miner. The process of
    validating each block by having a miner provide a mathematical proof is known
    as a <strong>“proof of work.”</strong></p><p>A miner who validates a new block
    is rewarded with a certain amount of value for doing this work. What is that value?
    The Ethereum blockchain uses an intrinsic digital token called “Ether.” Every
    time a miner proves a block, new Ether tokens are generated and awarded.</p><p>You
    might wonder: what guarantees that everyone sticks to one chain of blocks? How
    can we be sure that there doesn’t exist a subset of miners who will decide to
    create their own chain of blocks?</p><p>Earlier, we defined a blockchain as a**
    transactional singleton machine with shared-state**. Using this definition, we
    can understand the correct current state is a single global truth, which everyone
    must accept. Having multiple states (or chains) would ruin the whole system, because
    it would be impossible to agree on which state was the correct one. If the chains
    were to diverge, you might own 10 coins on one chain, 20 on another, and 40 on
    another. In this scenario, there would be no way to determine which chain was
    the most “valid.”</p><p>Whenever multiple paths are generated, a “fork” occurs.
    We typically want to avoid forks, because they disrupt the system and force people
    to choose which chain they “believe” in.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*O1fLdUJhfL5YOrUw0C0ivA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>To determine which path is most valid and prevent multiple chains,
    Ethereum uses a mechanism called the <strong>“GHOST protocol.”</strong></p><p><strong>“GHOST”
    = “Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree”</strong></p><p>In simple terms, <strong>the
    GHOST protocol says we must pick the path that has had the most computation done
    upon it</strong>. One way to determine that path is to use the block number of
    the most recent block (the “leaf block”), which represents the total number of
    blocks in the current path (not counting the genesis block). The higher the block
    number, the longer the path and the greater the mining effort that must have gone
    into arriving at the leaf. Using this reasoning allows us to agree on the canonical
    version of the current state.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3428/1*MZCUJTeZvgQsTDYPQOw_Vg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Now that you’ve gotten the 10,000-foot overview of what a blockchain
    is, let’s dive deeper into the main components that the Ethereum system is comprised
    of:</p><ul><li><p>accounts</p></li><li><p>state</p></li><li><p>gas and fees</p></li><li><p>transactions</p></li><li><p>blocks</p></li><li><p>transaction
    execution</p></li><li><p>mining</p></li><li><p>proof of work</p></li></ul><p><em>One
    note before getting started: whenever I say “hash” of X, I am referring to the
    <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/550/which-cryptographic-hash-function-does-ethereum-use">KECCAK-256</a>
    hash, which Ethereum uses.</em></p><h2>Accounts</h2><p>The global “shared-state”
    of Ethereum is comprised of many small objects (“accounts”) that are able to interact
    with one another through a message-passing framework. Each account has a <strong>state</strong>
    associated with it and a 20-byte <strong>address</strong>. An address in Ethereum
    is a 160-bit identifier that is used to identify any account.</p><p>There are
    two types of accounts:</p><ul><li><p>Externally owned accounts, which are <strong>controlled
    by private keys *<em>and have *</em>no code associated with them.</strong></p></li><li><p>Contract
    accounts, which are <strong>controlled by their contract code *<em>and *</em>have
    code associated with them.</strong></p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*HIpgnjvHE9Jpb58icF5MgQ.png"
    alt=""></p><h3>Externally owned accounts vs. contract accounts</h3><p>It’s important
    to understand a fundamental difference between externally owned accounts and contract
    accounts. <strong>An externally owned account can send messages to other externally
    owned accounts OR to other contract accounts by creating and signing a transaction
    using its private key.</strong> A message between two externally owned accounts
    is simply a value transfer. But a message from an externally owned account to
    a contract account activates the contract account’s code, allowing it to perform
    various actions (e.g. transfer tokens, write to internal storage, mint new tokens,
    perform some calculation, create new contracts, etc.).</p><p><strong>Unlike externally
    owned accounts, contract accounts can’t initiate new transactions on their own.</strong>
    Instead, contract accounts can only fire transactions in response to other transactions
    they have received (from an externally owned account or from another contract
    account). We’ll learn more about contract-to-contract calls in the “<em>Transactions
    and Messages</em>” section.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/1*I635Y9btMh667inOhDBQ_g.png"
    alt=""></p><p><strong>Therefore, any action that occurs on the Ethereum blockchain
    is always set in motion by transactions fired from externally controlled accounts.</strong></p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2448/1*LbHK28pCiB5dHRwpTMr30w.png" alt=""></p><h3>Account
    state</h3><p>The account <strong>state</strong> consists of four components, which
    are present regardless of the type of account:</p><ul><li><p><strong>nonce</strong>:
    If the account is an externally owned account, this number represents the number
    of transactions sent from the account’s address. If the account is a contract
    account, the nonce is the number of contracts created by the account.</p></li><li><p><strong>balance</strong>:
    The number of Wei owned by this address. There are 1e+18 Wei per Ether.</p></li><li><p><strong>storageRoot</strong>:
    A hash of the root node of a Merkle Patricia tree (we’ll explain Merkle trees
    later on). This tree encodes the hash of the storage contents of this account,
    and is empty by default.</p></li><li><p><strong>codeHash</strong>: The hash of
    the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine — more on this later) code of this account.
    For contract accounts, this is the code that gets hashed and stored as the <strong>codeHash</strong>.
    For externally owned accounts, the <strong>codeHash</strong> field is the hash
    of the empty string.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2548/1*fYY7nqa6NZkDS4WSkXmQoQ.png"
    alt=""></p><h3>World state</h3><p>Okay, so we know that Ethereum’s global state
    consists of a mapping between account addresses and the account states. This mapping
    is stored in a data structure known as a <strong>Merkle Patricia tree</strong>.</p><p>A
    Merkle tree (or also referred as “Merkle trie”) is a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree">binary
    tree</a> composed of a set of nodes with:</p><ul><li><p>a large number of leaf
    nodes at the bottom of the tree that contain the underlying data</p></li><li><p>a
    set of intermediate nodes, where each node is the hash of its two child nodes</p></li><li><p>a
    single root node, also formed from the hash of its two child node, representing
    the top of the tree</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3816/1*5xWwPX2R8d37MeWSFOJPnA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The data at the bottom of the tree is generated by splitting the
    data that we want to store into <em>chunks</em>, then splitting the chunks into
    <em>buckets</em>, and then taking the hash of each bucket and repeating the same
    process until the total number of hashes remaining becomes only one: <strong>the
    root hash.</strong></p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3896/1*TXlzvc6bh565UYLZC3Q6Vw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>This tree is required to have a key for every value stored inside
    it. Beginning from the root node of the tree, the key should tell you which child
    node to follow to get to the corresponding value, which is stored in the leaf
    nodes. In Ethereum’s case, the key/value mapping for the state tree is between
    addresses and their associated accounts, including the balance, nonce, codeHash,
    and storageRoot for each account (where the storageRoot is itself a tree).</p><p><img

    Ethereum whitepaper"><em>Source: Ethereum whitepaper</em></p><p>This same trie
    structure is used also to store transactions and receipts. More specifically,
    every block has a “header” which stores the hash of the root node of three different
    Merkle trie structures, including:</p><ol><li><p>State trie</p></li><li><p>Transactions
    trie</p></li><li><p>Receipts trie</p></li></ol><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2112/1*4EQFjXD2-dbiVgVv-8Si8g.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The ability to store all this information efficiently in Merkle
    tries is incredibly useful in Ethereum for what we call “light clients” or “light
    nodes.” Remember that a blockchain is maintained by a bunch of nodes. Broadly
    speaking, there are two types of nodes: full nodes and light nodes.</p><p><strong>A
    full archive node synchronizes the blockchain by downloading the full chain, from
    the genesis block to the current head block, executing all of the transactions
    contained within.</strong> Typically, miners store the full archive node, because
    they are required to do so for the mining process. It is also possible to download
    a full node without executing every transaction. Regardless, any full node contains
    the entire chain.</p><p>But unless a node needs to execute every transaction or
    easily query historical data, there’s really no need to store the entire chain.
    This is where the concept of a light node comes in. *<em>Instead of downloading
    and storing the full chain and executing all of the transactions, light nodes
    download only the chain of headers, from the genesis block to the current head,
    without executing any transactions or retrieving any associated state. *</em>Because
    light nodes have access to block headers, which contain hashes of three tries,
    they can still easily generate and receive verifiable answers about transactions,
    events, balances, etc.</p><p>The reason this works is because hashes in the Merkle
    tree propagate upward — if a malicious user attempts to swap a fake transaction
    into the bottom of a Merkle tree, this change will cause a change in the hash
    of the node above, which will change the hash of the node above that, and so on,
    until it eventually changes the root of the tree.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2312/1*MwnTtA5Q-EOAX8JCQEJp5g.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Any node that wants to verify a piece of data can use something
    called a “Merkle proof” to do so. A Merkle proof consists of:</p><ol><li><p>A
    chunk of data to be verified and its hash</p></li><li><p>The root hash of the
    tree</p></li><li><p>The “branch” (all of the partner hashes going up along the
    path from the chunk to the root)</p></li></ol><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*z9x-TsEK0aoZE4fp5wh49Q.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Anyone reading the proof can verify that the hashing for that branch
    is consistent all the way up the tree, and therefore that the given chunk is actually
    at that position in the tree.</p><p><strong>In summary, the benefit of using a
    Merkle Patricia tree is that the root node of this structure is cryptographically
    dependent on the data stored in the tree, and so the hash of the root node can
    be used as a secure identity for this data. Since the block header includes the
    root hash of the state, transactions, and receipts trees, any node can validate
    a small part of state of Ethereum without needing to store the entire state, which
    can be potentially unbounded in size.</strong></p><h2>Gas and payment</h2><p>One
    very important concept in Ethereum is the concept of fees. <strong>Every computation
    that occurs as a result of a transaction on the Ethereum network incurs a fee
    — there’s no free lunch!</strong> This fee is paid in a denomination called “gas.”</p><p><strong>Gas</strong>
    is the unit used to measure the fees required for a particular computation. <strong>Gas
    price</strong> is the amount of Ether you are willing to spend on every unit of
    gas, and is measured in “gwei.” “Wei” is the smallest unit of Ether, where 1⁰¹⁸
    Wei represents 1 Ether. One gwei is 1,000,000,000 Wei.</p><p>With every transaction,
    a sender sets a <strong>gas limit</strong> and** gas price<strong>. The product
    of **gas price</strong> and <strong>gas limit</strong> represents the maximum
    amount of Wei that the sender is willing to pay for executing a transaction.</p><p>For
    example, let’s say the sender sets the gas limit to 50,000 and a gas price to
    20 gwei. This implies that the sender is willing to spend at most 50,000 x 20
    gwei = 1,000,000,000,000,000 Wei = 0.001 Ether to execute that transaction.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2116/1*xSotR_QvCSKCF5C3APmIpA.png" alt=""></p><p>Remember
    that the gas limit represents the maximum gas the sender is willing to spend money
    on. If they have enough Ether in their account balance to cover this maximum,
    they’re good to go. The sender is refunded for any unused gas at the end of the
    transaction, exchanged at the original rate.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3464/1*UNCaS12SsPln7DEnRvcONQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>In the case that the sender does not provide the necessary gas to
    execute the transaction, the transaction runs “out of gas” and is considered invalid.
    In this case, the transaction processing aborts and any state changes that occurred
    are reversed, such that we end up back at the state of Ethereum prior to the transaction.
    Additionally, a record of the transaction failing gets recorded, showing what
    transaction was attempted and where it failed. And since the machine already expended
    effort to run the calculations before running out of gas, logically, <strong>none
    of the gas is refunded to the sender.</strong></p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3848/1*M_hHF3ML8gx46pIU3kJV6A.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Where exactly does this gas money go?** All the money spent on gas
    by the sender is sent to the “beneficiary” address, which is typically the miner’s
    address.** Since miners are expending the effort to run computations and validate
    transactions, miners receive the gas fee as a reward.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3348/1*BGZrZkYyRmLfehz3-Djv6w.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Typically, the higher the gas price the sender is willing to pay,
    the greater the value the miner derives from the transaction. Thus, the more likely
    miners will be to select it. In this way, miners are free to choose which transactions
    they want to validate or ignore. In order to guide senders on what gas price to
    set, miners have the option of advertising the minimum gas price for which they
    will execute transactions.</p><h3>There are fees for storage, too</h3><p>*<em>Not
    only is gas used to pay for computation steps, it is also used to pay for storage
    usage. *</em>The total fee for storage is proportional to the smallest multiple
    of 32 bytes used.</p><p>Fees for storage have some nuanced aspects. For example,
    since increased storage increases the size of the Ethereum state database on <em>all</em>
    nodes, there’s an incentive to keep the amount of data stored small. For this
    reason, if a transaction has a step that clears an entry in the storage, the fee
    for executing that operation of is waived, AND a refund is given for freeing up
    storage space.</p><h3><strong>What’s the purpose of fees?</strong></h3><p>One
    important aspect of the way the Ethereum works is that <strong>every single operation
    executed by the network is simultaneously effected by every full node.</strong>
    However, computational steps on the Ethereum Virtual Machine are very expensive.
    Therefore, Ethereum smart contracts are best used for simple tasks, like running
    simple business logic or verifying signatures and other cryptographic objects,
    rather than more complex uses, like file storage, email, or machine learning,
    which can put a strain on the network. <strong>Imposing fees prevents users from
    overtaxing the network.</strong></p><p>Ethereum is a Turing complete language.
    (In short, a Turing machine is a machine that can simulate any computer algorithm
    (for those not familiar with Turing machines, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">this</a>
    and <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TuringMachine.html">this</a>). This
    allows for loops and makes Ethereum susceptible to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">halting
    problem</a>, a problem in which you cannot determine whether or not a program
    will run infinitely. If there were no fees, a malicious actor could easily try
    to disrupt the network by executing an infinite loop within a transaction, without
    any repercussions. Thus, fees protect the network from deliberate attacks.</p><p>You
    might be thinking, “why do we also have to pay for storage?” Well, just like computation,
    storage on the Ethereum network is a cost that the entire network has to take
    the burden of.</p><h2>Transaction and messages</h2><p>We noted earlier that Ethereum
    is a <strong>transaction-based state machine.</strong> In other words, transactions
    occurring between different accounts are what move the global state of Ethereum
    from one state to the next.</p><p><strong>In the most basic sense, a transaction
    is a cryptographically signed piece of instruction that is generated by an externally
    owned account, serialized, and then submitted to the blockchain.</strong></p><p>There
    are two types of transactions: <strong>message calls</strong> and *<em>contract
    creations *</em>(i.e. transactions that create new Ethereum contracts). </p><p>All
    transactions contain the following components, regardless of their type:</p><ul><li><p><strong>nonce</strong>:
    a count of the number of transactions sent by the sender.</p></li><li><p><strong>gasPrice</strong>:
    the number of Wei that the sender is willing to pay per unit of gas required to
    execute the transaction.</p></li><li><p><strong>gasLimit</strong>: the maximum
    amount of gas that the sender is willing to pay for executing this transaction.
    This amount is set and paid upfront, before any computation is done.</p></li><li><p><strong>to</strong>:
    the address of the recipient. In a contract-creating transaction, the contract
    account address does not yet exist, and so an empty value is used.</p></li><li><p><strong>value</strong>:
    the amount of Wei to be transferred from the sender to the recipient. In a contract-creating
    transaction, this value serves as the starting balance within the newly created
    contract account.</p></li><li><p><strong>v, r, s</strong>: used to generate the
    signature that identifies the sender of the transaction.</p></li><li><p><strong>init</strong>
    (only exists for contract-creating transactions): An EVM code fragment that is
    used to initialize the new contract account. <strong>init</strong> is run only
    once, and then is discarded. When <strong>init</strong> is first run, it returns
    the body of the account code, which is the piece of code that is permanently associated
    with the contract account.</p></li><li><p><strong>data</strong> (optional field
    that only exists for message calls): the input data (i.e. parameters) of the message
    call. For example, if a smart contract serves as a domain registration service,
    a call to that contract might expect input fields such as the domain and IP address.</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*04kmylfdL1_kstojK65asQ.png" alt=""></p><p>We
    learned in the “<em>Accounts</em>” section that transactions — both message calls
    and contract-creating transactions — are always initiated by externally owned
    accounts and submitted to the blockchain. Another way to think about it is that
    transactions are what bridge the external world to the internal state of Ethereum.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3116/1*fGnVgckky5q91iFuYKLthA.png" alt=""></p><p>But
    this doesn’t mean that contracts can’t talk to other contracts. *<em>Contracts
    that exist within the global scope of Ethereum’s state can talk to other contracts
    within that same scope. The way they do this is via “messages” or “internal transactions”
    to other contracts. *</em>We can think of messages or internal transactions as
    being similar to transactions, with the major difference that they are NOT generated
    by externally owned accounts. Instead, they are generated by contracts. They are
    virtual objects that, unlike transactions, are not serialized and only exist in
    the Ethereum execution environment.</p><p><strong>When one contract sends an internal
    transaction to another contract, the associated code that exists on the recipient
    contract account is executed.</strong></p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3488/1*8wbH03HO4jL9bhT7Sa9ZCA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>One important thing to note is that internal transactions or messages
    don’t contain a *<em>gasLimit. *</em>This is because the gas limit is determined
    by the external creator of the original transaction (i.e. some externally owned
    account). The gas limit that the externally owned account sets must be high enough
    to carry out the transaction, including any sub-executions that occur as a result
    of that transaction, such as contract-to-contract messages. If, in the chain of
    transactions and messages, a particular message execution runs out of gas, then
    that message’s execution will revert, along with any subsequent messages triggered
    by the execution. However, the parent execution does not need to revert.</p><h2>Blocks</h2><p>All
    transactions are grouped together into “blocks.” A blockchain contains a series
    of such blocks that are chained together.</p><p>In Ethereum, a block consists
    of:</p><ul><li><p>the <strong>block header</strong></p></li><li><p>information
    about the <strong>set of transactions</strong> included in that block</p></li><li><p>a
    <strong>set of other block headers for the current block’s ommers</strong>.</p></li></ul><h3>Ommers
    explained</h3><p>What the heck is an “ommer?” An ommer is a block whose parent
    is equal to the current block’s parent’s parent. Let’s take a quick dive into
    what ommers are used for and why a block contains the block headers for ommers.</p><p>Because
    of the way Ethereum is built, block times are much lower (~15 seconds) than those
    of other blockchains, like Bitcoin (~10 minutes). This enables faster transaction
    processing. However, one of the downsides of shorter block times is that more
    competing block solutions are found by miners. These competing blocks are also
    referred to as “orphaned blocks” (i.e. mined blocks do not make it into the main
    chain).</p><p>The purpose of ommers is to help reward miners for including these
    orphaned blocks. The ommers that miners include must be “valid,” meaning within
    the sixth generation or smaller of the present block. After six children, stale
    orphaned blocks can no longer be referenced (because including older transactions
    would complicate things a bit).</p><p>Ommer blocks receive a smaller reward than
    a full block. Nonetheless, there’s still some incentive for miners to include
    these orphaned blocks and reap a reward.</p><h3>Block header</h3><p>Let’s get
    back to blocks for a moment. We mentioned previously that every block has a block
    “header,” but what exactly is this? </p><p>A block header is a portion of the
    block consisting of:</p><ul><li><p><strong>parentHash</strong>: a hash of the
    parent block’s header (this is what makes the block set a “chain”)</p></li><li><p><strong>ommersHash</strong>:
    a hash of the current block’s list of ommers</p></li><li><p><strong>beneficiary</strong>:
    the account address that receives the fees for mining this block</p></li><li><p><strong>stateRoot</strong>:
    the hash of the root node of the state trie (recall how we learned that the state
    trie is stored in the header and makes it easy for light clients to verify anything
    about the state)</p></li><li><p><strong>transactionsRoot</strong>: the hash of
    the root node of the trie that contains all transactions listed in this block</p></li><li><p><strong>receiptsRoot</strong>:
    the hash of the root node of the trie that contains the receipts of all transactions
    listed in this block</p></li><li><p><strong>logsBloom</strong>: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom
    filter</a> (data structure) that consists of log information</p></li><li><p><strong>difficulty</strong>:
    the difficulty level of this block</p></li><li><p><strong>number</strong>: the
    count of current block (the genesis block has a block number of zero; the block
    number increases by 1 for each each subsequent block)</p></li><li><p><strong>gasLimit</strong>:
    the current gas limit per block</p></li><li><p><strong>gasUsed</strong>: the sum
    of the total gas used by transactions in this block</p></li><li><p><strong>timestamp</strong>:
    the unix timestamp of this block’s inception</p></li><li><p><strong>extraData</strong>:
    extra data related to this block</p></li><li><p><strong>mixHash</strong>: a hash
    that, when combined with the nonce, proves that this block has carried out enough
    computation</p></li><li><p><strong>nonce</strong>: a hash that, when combined
    with the mixHash, proves that this block has carried out enough computation</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2112/1*4EQFjXD2-dbiVgVv-8Si8g.png" alt=""></p><p>Notice
    how every block header contains three trie structures for:</p><ul><li><p>state
    (<strong>stateRoot</strong>)</p></li><li><p>transactions (<strong>transactionsRoot</strong>)</p></li><li><p>receipts
    (<strong>receiptsRoot</strong>)</p></li></ul><p>These trie structures are nothing
    but the Merkle Patricia tries we discussed earlier.</p><p>Additionally, there
    are a few terms from the above description that are worth clarifying. Let’s take
    a look.</p><h3>Logs</h3><p>Ethereum allows for logs to make it possible to track
    various transactions and messages. A contract can explicitly generate a log by
    defining “events” that it wants to log.</p><p>A log entry contains:</p><ul><li><p>the
    logger’s account address,</p></li><li><p>a series of topics that represent various
    events carried out by this transaction, and</p></li><li><p>any data associated
    with these events.</p></li></ul><p>Logs are stored in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">bloom
    filter</a>, which stores the endless log data in an efficient manner.</p><h3>Transaction
    receipt</h3><p>Logs stored in the header come from the log information contained
    in the transaction receipt. Just as you receive a receipt when you buy something
    at a store, Ethereum generates a receipt for every transaction. Like you’d expect,
    each receipt contains certain information about the transaction. This receipt
    includes items like:</p><ul><li><p>the block number</p></li><li><p>block hash</p></li><li><p>transaction
    hash</p></li><li><p>gas used by the current transaction</p></li><li><p>cumulative
    gas used in the current block after the current transaction has executed</p></li><li><p>logs
    created when executing the current transaction</p></li><li><p>..and so on</p></li></ul><h3>Block
    difficulty</h3><p>The “difficulty” of a block is used to enforce consistency in
    the time it takes to validate blocks. The genesis block has a difficulty of 131,072,
    and a special formula is used to calculate the difficulty of every block thereafter.
    If a certain block is validated more quickly than the previous block, the Ethereum
    protocol increases that block’s difficulty.</p><p>The difficulty of the block
    affects the *<em>nonce, *</em>which is a hash that must be calculated when mining
    a block, using the proof-of-work algorithm.</p><p>The relationship between the
    block’s <strong>difficulty</strong> and <strong>nonce</strong> is mathematically
    formalized as:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*5sQvq61s8QBk1xXPKmWu2w.png"
    alt=""></p><p><em>where *</em>Hd** is the difficulty.*</p><p>The only way to find
    a nonce that meets a difficulty threshold is to use the proof-of-work algorithm
    to enumerate all of the possibilities. The expected time to find a solution is
    proportional to the difficulty — the higher the difficulty, the harder it becomes
    to find the nonce, and so the harder it is to validate the block, which in turn
    increases the time it takes to validate a new block. <strong>So, by adjusting
    the difficulty of a block, the protocol can adjust how long it takes to validate
    a block.</strong></p><p>If, on the other hand, validation time is getting slower,
    the protocol decreases the difficulty. In this way, the validation time self-adjusts
    to maintain a constant rate — on average, one block every 15 seconds.</p><h2>Transaction
    Execution</h2><p>We’ve come to one of the most complex parts of the Ethereum protocol:
    the execution of a transaction. Say you send a transaction off into the Ethereum
    network to be processed. What happens to transition the state of Ethereum to include
    your transaction?</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2480/1*IxHl8-O1EYt48FpKQB_Sww.png"
    alt=""></p><p>First, all transactions must meet an initial set of requirements
    in order to be executed. These include:</p><ul><li><p>The transaction must be
    a properly formatted <strong>RLP</strong>. “RLP” stands for “Recursive Length
    Prefix” and is a data format used to encode nested arrays of binary data. RLP
    is the format Ethereum uses to serialize objects.</p></li><li><p>Valid transaction
    signature.</p></li><li><p>Valid transaction nonce. Recall that the nonce of an
    account is the count of transactions sent from that account. To be valid, a transaction
    nonce must be equal to the sender account’s nonce.</p></li><li><p>The transaction’s
    gas limit must be equal to or greater than the <strong>intrinsic gas</strong>
    used by the transaction. The intrinsic gas includes:</p></li></ul><ol><li><p>a
    predefined cost of 21,000 gas for executing the transaction</p></li><li><p>a gas
    fee for data sent with the transaction (4 gas for every byte of data or code that
    equals zero, and 68 gas for every non-zero byte of data or code)</p></li><li><p>if
    the transaction is a contract-creating transaction, an additional 32,000 gas</p></li></ol><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2168/1*vO9aZkm5gTeEJduOXVQuRg.png" alt=""></p><ul><li>The
    sender’s account balance must have enough Ether to cover the <strong>“upfront”
    gas costs</strong> that the sender must pay. The calculation for the upfront gas
    cost is simple: First, the transaction’s** gas limit** is multiplied by the transaction’s**
    gas price **to determine the maximum gas cost. Then, this maximum cost is added
    to the total value being transferred from the sender to the recipient.</li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*lX4pdY7owk7LHbC6rz3cow.png" alt=""></p><p>If
    the transaction meets all of the above requirements for validity, then we move
    onto the next step.</p><p>First, we deduct the upfront cost of execution from
    the sender’s balance, and increase the nonce of the sender’s account by 1 to account
    for the current transaction. At this point, we can calculate the gas remaining
    as the <strong>total gas limit for the transaction minus the intrinsic gas used.</strong></p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2756/1*XKKFOIXYtxqrUHpGRj-gNA.png" alt=""></p><p>Next,
    the transaction starts executing. Throughout the execution of a transaction, Ethereum
    keeps track of the “substate.” This substate is a way to record information accrued
    during the transaction that will be needed immediately after the transaction completes.
    Specifically, it contains:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Self-destruct set</strong>: a
    set of accounts (if any) that will be discarded after the transaction completes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Log
    series</strong>: archived and indexable checkpoints of the virtual machine’s code
    execution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Refund balance</strong>: the amount to be refunded
    to the sender account after the transaction. Remember how we mentioned that storage
    in Ethereum costs money, and that a sender is refunded for clearing up storage?
    Ethereum keeps track of this using a refund counter. The refund counter starts
    at zero and increments every time the contract deletes something in storage.</p></li></ul><p>Next,
    the various computations required by the transaction are processed.</p><p>Once
    all the steps required by the transaction have been processed, and assuming there
    is no invalid state, the state is finalized by determining the amount of unused
    gas to be refunded to the sender. In addition to the unused gas, the sender is
    also refunded some allowance from the “refund balance” that we described above.</p><p>Once
    the sender is refunded:</p><ul><li><p>the Ether for the gas is given to the miner</p></li><li><p>the
    gas used by the transaction is added to the block gas counter (which keeps track
    of the total gas used by all transactions in the block, and is useful when validating
    a block)</p></li><li><p>all accounts in the self-destruct set (if any) are deleted</p></li></ul><p>Finally,
    we’re left with the new state and a set of the logs created by the transaction.</p><p>Now
    that we’ve covered the basics of transaction execution, let’s look at some of
    the differences between contract-creating transactions and message calls.</p><h3>Contract
    creation</h3><p>Recall that in Ethereum, there are two types of accounts: contract
    accounts and externally owned accounts. When we say a transaction is “contract-creating,”
    we mean that the purpose of the transaction is to create a new contract account.</p><p>In
    order to create a new contract account, we first declare the address of the new
    account using a special formula. Then we initialize the new account by:</p><ul><li><p>Setting
    the nonce to zero</p></li><li><p>If the sender sent some amount of Ether as <em>value</em>
    with the transaction, setting the account balance to that value</p></li><li><p>Deducting
    the value added to this new account’s balance from the sender’s balance</p></li><li><p>Setting
    the storage as empty</p></li><li><p>Setting the contract’s codeHash as the hash
    of an empty string</p></li></ul><p>Once we initialize the account, we can actually
    create the account, using the <strong>init code</strong> sent with the transaction
    (see the “Transaction and messages” section for a refresher on the init code).
    What happens during the execution of this init code is varied. Depending on the
    constructor of the contract, it might update the account’s storage, create other
    contract accounts, make other message calls, etc.</p><p>As the code to initialize
    a contract is executed, it uses gas. <strong>The transaction is not allowed to
    use up more gas than the remaining gas. If it does, the execution will hit an
    out-of-gas (OOG) exception and exit. If the transaction exits due to an out-of-gas
    exception, then the state is reverted to the point immediately prior to transaction.
    The sender is *not *refunded the gas that was spent before running out.</strong></p><p>Boo
    hoo.</p><p>However, if the sender sent any Ether value with the transaction, the
    Ether value will be refunded even if the contract creation fails. Phew!</p><p>If
    the initialization code executes successfully, a final contract-creation cost
    is paid. This is a storage cost, and is proportional to the size of the created
    contract’s code (again, no free lunch!) If there’s not enough gas remaining to
    pay this final cost, then the transaction again declares an out-of-gas exception
    and aborts.</p><p>If all goes well and we make it this far without exceptions,
    then any remaining unused gas is refunded to the original sender of the transaction,
    and the altered state is now allowed to persist!</p><p>Hooray!</p><h3>Message
    calls</h3><p>The execution of a message call is similar to that of a contract
    creation, with a few differences.</p><p>A message call execution does not include
    any init code, since no new accounts are being created. However, it can contain
    input data, if this data was provided by the transaction sender. Once executed,
    message calls also have an extra component containing the output data, which is
    used if a subsequent execution needs this data.</p><p>As is true with contract
    creation, if a message call execution exits because it runs out of gas or because
    the transaction is invalid (e.g. stack overflow, invalid jump destination, or
    invalid instruction), none of the gas used is refunded to the original caller.
    Instead, all of the remaining unused gas is consumed, and the state is reset to
    the point immediately prior to balance transfer.</p><p>Until the most recent update
    of Ethereum, there was no way to stop or revert the execution of a transaction
    without having the system consume all the gas you provided. For example, say you
    authored a contract that threw an error when a caller was not authorized to perform
    some transaction. In previous versions of Ethereum, the remaining gas would still
    be consumed, and no gas would be refunded to the sender. <strong>But the Byzantium
    update includes a new “revert” code that allows a contract to stop execution and
    revert state changes, without consuming the remaining gas, and with the ability
    to return a reason for the failed transaction.</strong> If a transaction exits
    due to a revert, then the unused gas is returned to the sender.</p><h2>Execution
    model</h2><p>So far, we’ve learned about the series of steps that have to happen
    for a transaction to execute from start to finish. Now, we’ll look at how the
    transaction actually executes within the VM.</p><p><strong>The part of the protocol
    that actually handles processing the transactions is Ethereum’s own virtual machine,
    known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).</strong></p><p>The EVM is a Turing
    complete virtual machine, as defined earlier. The only limitation the EVM has
    that a typical Turing complete machine does not is that the EVM is intrinsically
    bound by gas. Thus, the total amount of computation that can be done is intrinsically
    limited by the amount of gas provided.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*q9jrIqmLZ-wXlXg9tlpu9g.png"
    alt="Source: CMU"><em>Source: CMU</em></p><p>Moreover, the EVM has a stack-based
    architecture. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine">stack machine</a>
    is a computer that uses a last-in, first-out stack to hold temporary values.</p><p>The
    size of each stack item in the EVM is 256-bit, and the stack has a maximum size
    of 1024.</p><p>The EVM has memory, where items are stored as word-addressed byte
    arrays. Memory is volatile, meaning it is not permanent.</p><p>The EVM also has
    storage. Unlike memory, storage is non-volatile and is maintained as part of the
    system state. The EVM stores program code separately, in a virtual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory">ROM</a>
    that can only be accessed via special instructions. In this way, the EVM differs
    from the typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von
    Neumann architecture</a>, in which program code is stored in memory or storage.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3208/1*-OH3Yr_UHRRimsKKNpPzPw.png" alt=""></p><p>The
    EVM also has its own language: “EVM bytecode.” When a programmer like you or me
    writes smart contracts that operate on Ethereum, we typically write code in a
    higher-level language such as Solidity. We can then compile that down to EVM bytecode
    that the EVM can understand.</p><p>Okay, now on to execution.</p><p>Before executing
    a particular computation, the processor makes sure that the following information
    is available and valid:</p><ul><li><p>System state</p></li><li><p>Remaining gas
    for computation</p></li><li><p>Address of the account that owns the code that
    is executing</p></li><li><p>Address of the sender of the transaction that originated
    this execution</p></li><li><p>Address of the account that caused the code to execute
    (could be different from the original sender)</p></li><li><p>Gas price of the
    transaction that originated this execution</p></li><li><p>Input data for this
    execution</p></li><li><p>Value (in Wei) passed to this account as part of the
    current execution</p></li><li><p>Machine code to be executed</p></li><li><p>Block
    header of the current block</p></li><li><p>Depth of the present message call or
    contract creation stack</p></li></ul><p>At the start of execution, memory and
    stack are empty and the program counter is zero.</p><pre><code>PC: 0 STACK: []
    MEM: [], STORAGE: {}</code></pre><p>The EVM then executes the transaction recursively,
    computing the <strong>system state</strong> and the *<em>machine state *</em>for
    each loop. The system state is simply Ethereum’s global state. The machine state
    is comprised of:</p><ul><li><p>gas available</p></li><li><p>program counter</p></li><li><p>memory
    contents</p></li><li><p>active number of words in memory</p></li><li><p>stack
    contents.</p></li></ul><p>Stack items are added or removed from the leftmost portion
    of the series.</p><p>On each cycle, the appropriate gas amount is reduced from
    the remaining gas, and the program counter increments.</p><p>At the end of each
    loop, there are three possibilities:</p><ol><li><p>The machine reaches an exceptional
    state (e.g. insufficient gas, invalid instructions, insufficient stack items,
    stack items would overflow above 1024, invalid JUMP/JUMPI destination, etc.) and
    so must be halted, with any changes discarded</p></li><li><p>The sequence continues
    to process into the next loop</p></li><li><p>The machine reaches a controlled
    halt (the end of the execution process)</p></li></ol><p>Assuming the execution
    doesn’t hit an exceptional state and reaches a “controlled” or normal halt, the
    machine generates the resultant state, the remaining gas after this execution,
    the accrued substate, and the resultant output.</p><p>Phew. We got through one
    of the most complex parts of Ethereum. Even if you didn’t fully comprehend this
    part, that’s okay. You don’t <em>really</em> need to understand the nitty gritty
    execution details unless you’re working at a very deep level.</p><h3>How a block
    gets finalized</h3><p>Finally, let’s look at how a block of many transactions
    gets finalized.</p><p>When we say “finalized,” it can mean two different things,
    depending on whether the block is new or existing. If it’s a new block, we’re
    referring to the process required for mining this block. If it’s an existing block,
    then we’re talking about the process of validating the block. In either case,
    there are four requirements for a block to be “finalized”:</p><p><strong>1) Validate
    (or, if mining, determine) ommers</strong> Each ommer block within the block header
    must be a valid header and be within the sixth generation of the present block.</p><p><strong>2)
    Validate (or, if mining, determine) transactions</strong>The <strong>gasUsed</strong>
    number on the block must be equal to the cumulative gas used by the transactions
    listed in the block. (Recall that when executing a transaction, we keep track
    of the block gas counter, which keeps track of the total gas used by all transactions
    in the block).</p><p><strong>3) Apply rewards (only if mining)</strong>The beneficiary
    address is awarded 5 Ether for mining the block. (Under Ethereum proposal <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/669">EIP-649</a>,
    this reward of 5 ETH will soon be reduced to 3 ETH). Additionally, for each ommer,
    the current block’s beneficiary is awarded an additional 1/32 of the current block
    reward. Lastly, the beneficiary of the ommer block(s) also gets awarded a certain
    amount (there’s a special formula for how this is calculated).</p><p><strong>4)
    Verify (or, if mining, compute a valid) state and nonce</strong>Ensure that all
    transactions and resultant state changes are applied, and then define the new
    block as the state after the block reward has been applied to the final transaction’s
    resultant state. Verification occurs by checking this final state against the
    state trie stored in the header.</p><h2>Mining proof of work</h2><p>The “<em>Blocks</em>”
    section briefly addressed the concept of block difficulty. The algorithm that
    gives meaning to block difficulty is called Proof of Work (PoW).</p><p>Ethereum’s
    proof-of-work algorithm is called “<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash">Ethash</a>”
    (previously known as Dagger-Hashimoto).</p><p>The algorithm is formally defined
    as:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*BJrvs-jGJTtpsOXdseZBLQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p><em>where *</em>m** is the <strong>mixHash</strong>, <strong>n</strong>
    is the <strong>nonce</strong>, <strong>Hn</strong> is the new block’s header (excluding
    the <strong>nonce</strong> and <strong>mixHash</strong> components, which have
    to be computed), <strong>Hn</strong> is the nonce of the block header, and** d**
    is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a>,
    which is a large data set.*</p><p>In the “<em>Blocks</em>” section, we talked
    about the various items that exist in a block header. Two of those components
    were called the <strong>mixHash</strong> and the <strong>nonce</strong>. As you
    may recall:</p><ul><li><p><strong>mixHash **is</strong> **a hash that, when combined
    with the nonce, proves that this block has carried out enough computation</p></li><li><p>*<em>nonce
    *</em>is a hash that, when combined with the mixHash, proves that this block has
    carried out enough computation</p></li></ul><p>The PoW function is used to evaluate
    these two items.</p><p>How exactly the <strong>mixHash</strong> and <strong>nonce</strong>
    are calculated using the PoW function is somewhat complex, and something we can
    delve deeper into in a separate post. But at a high level, it works like this:</p><p>A
    “seed” is calculated for each block. This seed is different for every “epoch,”
    where each epoch is 30,000 blocks long. For the first epoch, the seed is the hash
    of a series of 32 bytes of zeros. For every subsequent epoch, it is the hash of
    the previous seed hash. Using this seed, a node can calculate a pseudo-random
    “cache.”</p><p>This cache is incredibly useful because it enables the concept
    of “light nodes,” which we discussed previously in this post. The purpose of light
    nodes is to afford certain nodes the ability to efficiently verify a transaction
    without the burden of storing the entire blockchain dataset. A light node can
    verify the validity of a transaction based solely on this cache, because the cache
    can regenerate the specific block it needs to verify.</p><p>Using the cache, a
    node can generate the DAG “dataset,” where each item in the dataset depends on
    a small number of pseudo-randomly-selected items from the cache. In order to be
    a miner, you must generate this full dataset; all full clients and miners store
    this dataset, and the dataset grows linearly with time.</p><p>Miners can then
    take random slices of the dataset and put them through a mathematical function
    to hash them together into a “<strong>mixHash.</strong>” A miner will repeatedly
    generate a <strong>mixHash</strong> until the output is below the desired target
    <strong>nonce</strong>. When the output meets this requirement, this nonce is
    considered valid and the block can be added to the chain.</p><p><strong>Mining
    as a security mechanism</strong> Overall, the purpose of the PoW is to prove,
    in a cryptographically secure way, that a particular amount of computation has
    been expended to generate some output (i.e. the <strong>nonce</strong>). <strong>This
    is because there is no better way to find a nonce that is below the required threshold
    other than to enumerate all the possibilities.</strong> The outputs of repeatedly
    applying the hash function have a uniform distribution, and so we can be assured
    that, on average, <strong>the time needed to find such a nonce depends on the
    difficulty threshold. **The higher the difficulty, the longer it takes to solve
    for the nonce. In this way,</strong> the PoW algorithm gives meaning to the concept
    of difficulty, which is used to enforce blockchain security.**</p><p>What do we
    mean by blockchain security? It’s simple: we want to create a blockchain that
    EVERYONE trusts. As we discussed previously in this post, if more than one chain
    existed, users would lose trust, because they would be unable to reasonably determine
    which chain was the “valid” chain. In order for a group of users to accept the
    underlying state that is stored on a blockchain, we need a single canonical blockchain
    that a group of people believes in.</p><p><strong>This is exactly what the PoW
    algorithm does: it ensures that a particular blockchain will remain canonical
    into the future, making it incredibly difficult for an attacker to create new
    blocks that overwrite a certain part of history (e.g. by erasing transactions
    or creating fake transactions) or maintain a fork.</strong> To have their block
    validated first, an attacker would need to consistently solve for the nonce faster
    than anyone else in the network, such that the network believes their chain is
    the heaviest chain (based on the principles of the GHOST protocol we mentioned
    earlier). This would be impossible unless the attacker had more than half of the
    network mining power, a scenario known as the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Majority_attack">majority
    51% attack</a>.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3308/1*ULPB9XpVL2Ny8B_Yt75p9w.png"
    alt=""></p><h3>Mining as a wealth distribution mechanism</h3><p>Beyond providing
    a secure blockchain, PoW is also a way to distribute wealth to those who expend
    their computation for providing this security. Recall that a miner receives a
    reward for mining a block, including:</p><ul><li><p>a *static block reward *of
    5 ether for the “winning’” block (soon to be <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/669">changed
    to 3 ether</a>)</p></li><li><p>the cost of gas expended within the block by the
    transactions included in the block</p></li><li><p>an extra reward for including
    ommers as part of the block</p></li></ul><p>In order to ensure that the use of
    the PoW consensus mechanism for security and wealth distribution is sustainable
    in the long run, Ethereum strives to instill these two properties:</p><ul><li><p>Make
    it accessible to as many people as possible. In other words, people shouldn’t
    need specialized or uncommon hardware to run the algorithm. The purpose of this
    is to make the wealth distribution model as open as possible so that anyone can
    provide any amount of compute power in return for Ether.</p></li><li><p>Reduce
    the possibility for any single node (or small set) to make a disproportionate
    amount of profit. Any node that can make a disproportionate amount of profit means
    that the node has a large influence on determining the canonical blockchain. This
    is troublesome because it reduces network security.</p></li></ul><p>In the Bitcoin
    blockchain network, one problem that arises in relation to the above two properties
    is that the PoW algorithm is a SHA256 hash function. The weakness with this type
    of function is that it can be solved much more efficiently using specialized hardware,
    also known as ASICs.</p><p>In order to mitigate this issue, Ethereum has chosen
    to make its PoW algorithm (<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash">Ethhash</a>)
    sequentially memory-hard. This means that the algorithm is engineered so that
    calculating the nonce requires a lot of memory AND bandwidth. The large memory
    requirements make it hard for a computer to use its memory in parallel to discover
    multiple nonces simultaneously, and the high bandwidth requirements make it difficult
    for even a super-fast computer to discover multiple nonce simultaneously. This
    reduces the risk of centralization and creates a more level playing field for
    the nodes that are doing the verification.</p><p>One thing to note is that Ethereum
    is transitioning from a PoW consensus mechanism to something called “proof-of-stake”.
    This is a beastly topic of its own that we can hopefully explore in a future post.
    ☺️</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>…Phew! You made it to the end. I hope?</p><p>There’s
    a lot to digest in this post, I know. If it takes you multiple reads to fully
    understand what’s going on, that’s totally fine. I personally read the Ethereum
    yellow paper, white paper, and various parts of the code base many times before
    grokking what was going on.</p><p>Nonetheless, I hope you found this overview
    helpful. If you find any errors or mistakes, I’d love for you to write a private
    note or post it directly in the comments. I look at all of ’em, I promise ;)</p><p>And
    remember, I’m human (yep, it’s true) and I make mistakes. I took the time to write
    this post for the benefit of the community, for free. So please be constructive
    in your feedback, without unnecessary bashing. ☺️</p><p>[1] <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper">https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper</a></p>'

    by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jdubs?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral">Johnson
    Wang</a></em></p><p>There is a story about an exchange between Jerry Seinfeld
    and a young comedian. The comedian approaches Seinfeld in a club one night and
    asks him for advice about marketing and getting exposure.</p><p>Exposure? Marketing?
    Seinfeld asks. <em>Just work on your act.</em></p><p>Seinfeld, a pure stand-up,
    a comedian’s comedian, is appalled by the question. It’s offensive to his legendary
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2blrd9/jerry_seinfeld_loves_answering_questions_the/">heads-down
    work ethic</a>. But to the kid, this was a surprise. Isn’t that the kind of question
    you’re supposed to ask? Isn’t that how you get ahead?</p><p>He’s not alone. Certainly,
    I myself wasted many chances to learn about how to improve my craft by instead
    asking people I admire for superficial hacks and career opportunities. I see the
    same mistake repeated in subreddits and forums and blogs and Facebook groups that
    (aspiring) creative professionals — writers, designers, startup founders — use
    as networking vehicles and support systems. If Seinfeld ever saw them, he’d cringe
    at every word.</p><p>Because these often closed groups are self-selected communities
    of ambitious, motivated go-getters, there is a tendency to skip the slow and immeasurable
    creative process and go right to the tactics for getting attention or catching
    a break. They want tricks and tips for getting ahead, hacks for advancing their
    careers. Even amongst the more advanced or already successful, the questions posed
    to the group are mostly technical: How do you guys like to negotiate contracts?
    How can I sell more copies or increase my fees? Who is the best agent?</p><blockquote><h1>No
    one pursuing an artistic career wants to hear what sits at the core of Seinfeld’s
    advice: Your work isn’t good enough.</h1></blockquote><p>Not that these things
    aren’t important. Certainly I’d like to know the answers myself but judging by
    the amount of time people spend asking them, or talking about their complicated
    Evernote systems or their preferred deal terms, or the readiness with which they
    are willing to share their elaborate rituals and routines, the less cynical person
    would assume that everyone must have already mastered their craft and the only
    thing left for them to worry about is mopping up a few minor details at the margins.</p><p>If
    only…</p><p>Because if that were even remotely true, we wouldn’t be drowning in
    so much mediocrity — if not outright garbage. The *reason *it’s not true is that
    nobody in these forums, really no one pursuing an artistic career, wants to hear
    what sits at the core of Seinfeld’s advice: Your work isn’t good enough. Keep
    your head down. You still have a long way to go.</p><p>To me, one of the root
    causes of this situation is the economic transformation that creative industries
    have gone through over the last twenty years. There used to be publishers, art
    dealers, investors, managers, and record labels that handled the majority of the
    business side of the equation. But increasingly, the relevance of those partners
    has fallen away, and the number of hats a creator wears has increased. The artist
    can’t just be <em>an artist</em> — they also have to know how to upload YouTube
    videos, use GIFs, promote gigs, and figure out how to get followers on various
    platforms. The artist has far more visibility into their earnings and their distribution,
    than ever before. With that comes more leverage, all of which is a good thing.</p><p>But
    the unintended consequence of, what one might call, total brand and business control,
    is that it diverts attention away from the most essential part of any creative
    profession. You know, <em>making great stuff.</em></p><p>It’s hard to do that
    under ideal circumstances; harder still when you’re tweeting or visualizing your
    next Instagram story or flying to some industry conference. And podcasts… every
    one of them takes an hour. <em>If you’re lucky.</em> And more are created every
    single day and again, <em>if you’re lucky</em>,* *people will want to have you
    on theirs.</p><p>Earlier this month, NovelRank.com, a site which let authors track
    their sales rank on Amazon across all regions, was shut down by Amazon. The “official”
    reason had something to do with the terms of service of their affiliate program.
    I’d never cheer someone losing their business, but secretly, I’m quite grateful
    to whoever made that call at Amazon. I have spent <em>way</em> too much of my
    time refreshing that site, checking how my books were selling in Germany or trying
    to figure out why the rank of one of <a href="http://geni.us/kQm14i">my older
    books</a> suddenly shot up.</p><blockquote><h1>An artist’s job is to create masterpieces.
    Period.</h1></blockquote><p>A line from Phil Libin, the founder of Evernote, is
    “people who are thinking about things other than making the best product, never
    make the best product.” I’m willing to overlook the fact that Evernote is too
    often a shiny distraction for creatives — a black hole into which time is thrown
    under the auspices of “research” and “organization” — because he’s totally right.</p><p>It
    echoes an even more poignant sentiment from Cyril Connolly <a href="http://geni.us/93C47dR">which
    I quoted in *Perennial Seller</a>*: “The more books we read, the clearer it becomes
    that the true function of a writer is to produce a masterpiece and that no other
    task is of any consequence.”</p><p>An artist’s job is to create masterpieces.
    Period.</p><p>Everything else is secondary.</p><p>About a year ago, my mind began
    to construct this recurring moving image that would play on a loop whenever I
    was working on a book or a particularly difficult article. I’d close my eyes,
    think about the project, and there it would be. The image is of an unidentifiable
    baseball player at the plate. It’s zoomed in like one of those SportsCenter closeups,
    and the batter is already mid-swing and connecting with the ball. It’s one of
    those beautiful, old-timey swings like Mickey Mantle or Ted Williams used to do.
    The front leg extended, the back leg all the way back, the bat coming up and hitting
    the ball perfectly.</p><p>That’s it. That’s the whole image.</p><p>I don’t see
    where the ball goes, whether it was a base hit or a grand slam. I suspect earlier
    in my career, I would have cared about the outcome. I would have cared about who
    the player was and what team he played for. I would have needed to know whether
    the ball went foul or found a fielder’s mitt or cleared the upper deck. But as
    I have gotten better as a writer, paradoxically, it doesn’t even occur to me that
    such a thing would matter.</p><p>The image is just the connecting. The bat and
    the ball. The thing that is supposed to be all but physically impossible — hitting
    a rock coming at 90 miles per hour, that traveled from an elevated mound down
    to the batter in less than 400 milliseconds. Over and over again. The connecting.</p><p>Very
    few of us can do that impossible thing. Can connect like that. Can cut it in the
    big leagues, where the ball looks like a marble as it comes over the plate and
    pitchers put it in a spot the size of a croquet ball… at 90+ mph. Very few can
    time their swing just right to meet the ball and hear that satisfying crack as
    the ball heads back the other direction. And to do it more than once? To do it
    game in and game out, day in and day out? It’s a miracle. It requires complete
    and total dedication.</p><p>If you cease practicing for a second, if you let your
    mind get wound too tight or simply allowed to drift elsewhere, you will lose that
    ability. Your bat will stop connecting with the ball, your batting average will
    drop and soon enough you yourself will be dropped, first from the majors and then
    the sport altogether.</p><p>That’s what I think the image is supposed to be a
    reminder to me of. Writing of course is all about a kind of consistent connection:
    with the audience, with yourself, with something that goes to the essence of the
    human experience. Really, that’s all art and commerce are, too. Not to put too
    fine a point on it, but they are about swinging at the right pitches too.</p><p>When

  :title: How I landed a full stack developer job without a tech degree or work experience
  :content: "<p>Six months ago, I got my first developer job as full stack web developer
    for a startup. I had no relevant work experience, no tech degree, and not even
    a year of active coding experience. And yet I managed to land my dream offer,
    and can today for the first time in my life say that I love my job. Here’s how
    I did it — the long version.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*TDuYHwIBvClPXrgk.\"
    alt=\"\"></p><h2><strong>Part 1: Embracing the quarter-life crisis</strong></h2><p>About
    three years ago, I was in the middle of a raging quarter-life crisis. I’d graduated
    from business school, gotten an attractive investment banking job, and then quit
    that same job just a few months in after realizing I hated everything about it.</p><p>Completely
    lost and quite cliché, I went solo traveling for a few months to “find myself”.
    And although I thought I did, I didn’t. Not enough anyway. But it actually helped
    me figure out a few things.</p><p>The first thing was that I simply couldn’t keep
    pursuing a finance career. I just couldn’t see any future scenario where that
    would make me happy.</p><p>The second thing was that backpacking and surfing,
    although being great and all, wouldn’t help me find that “calling” I was looking
    for. The only reasonable thing to do seemed like the classic trial-and-error method.</p><p>So
    when I got back home, I decided to try out a few things that I thought might both
    make me happy and at the same time provide for some sort of decent living. And
    trial-and-error it was.</p><p>First, I thought I’d give writing a serious shot.
    So I started writing and editing part-time for an online business magazine. It
    was pretty cool for a while. Working three days a week in a fast-paced editorial
    office, writing about anything business, finance, tech or sustainability-related.</p><p>At
    the same time, I’d heard so much about life as a freelancer while travelling that
    I thought I’d try it out. So I set up my own firm, and soon enough stumbled upon
    a few business analyst projects. Being my own boss was of course very exciting
    at first, and being able to work from literally anywhere was completely new for
    me.</p><p>I went on like this for about eight months, doubling as a writer/editor
    and a freelancing business analyst. But eventually I started losing interest in
    the job at the magazine.</p><p>As any sane person dealing with digital content
    will know, clickbait cultures come at the expense of creativity and quality. In
    other words, when the main incentive of your content is clicks, all the superlatives
    required to hunt down those clicks will soon wear down on any creative ambitions
    that were there in the first place. Besides, I couldn’t shake the feeling that
    as a writer/editor, I was always too far away from the action I was reporting
    on.</p><p>So I quit. Which was ok according to my trial-and-error deal with myself.
    But it still felt crappy, since I’d actually invested eight months into the whole
    writing thing. But as someone smart may or may not have said: when one door closes,
    another one opens.</p><p>And I still had one more thing on my trial-and-error
    list to check off.</p><h2><strong>Part 2: The lunch that changed my life</strong></h2><p>Life
    is weird, and sometimes it will hide the biggest, most life-changing inspirations
    in the places you’d least expect. It was certainly like that for me when I experienced
    my first “pull” towards coding.</p><p>Although quitting the job at the magazine
    felt like a failure, the experience would prove to not have been completely in
    vain after all. After writing so much about tech startups and the exciting lives
    of entrepreneurs, I was dead set on giving that lifestyle a shot as well.</p><p>And
    after about a month of research and job hunting, I managed to land a job at one
    of the then — supposedly — most promising FinTech companies in the Nordics. In
    just a few years, it had grown to become one of Europe’s biggest equity crowdfunding
    platforms.</p><p>I hadn’t really applied to any specific job opening. But since
    I really believed in the company’s mission, and was impressed by their success,
    I’d rather just gotten in touch with their CFO telling him just that. We met a
    couple of times, and all of a sudden I was working there in some quite fuzzy business
    development role.</p><p>Although I’d hoped to get to work on strategic and analytical
    projects, I ended up doing what fuzzy business developers usually end up doing:
    selling. Which was also why this job too didn’t work out in the end.</p><p>But,
    there’s more.</p><p>Just like the last job experience from the magazine, this
    job would also prove to not have been all in vain. In fact, without it, I’d probably
    not be a developer today. Because that’s where I met Sandra.</p><p>She was a front-end
    developer in the product team, sitting just on the other end of the tiny coworking
    office we were cramped in at the time.</p><p>Technically we were colleagues, but
    as anyone whose worked in a dysfunctional tech company will know, the distance
    from the sales team to the product team can often feel like galaxies apart.</p><p>It
    didn’t help that management had just decided to outsource the whole dev team to
    a remote team in Ukraine either. Meaning Sandra and all the other developers would
    be let go and were more or less just serving their two months notice.</p><p>Despite
    this distance, one day Sandra and I ended up having lunch together. It would basically
    be my first real conversation with a professional developer, and I think it was
    a mix of genuine curiosity and my accelerating existential crisis that quickly
    more or less turned the lunch into an interview.</p><p>And our lunch ended up
    being a totally life-changing experience for me. More specifically, <strong>three
    revelations</strong> made it so.</p><ol><li><p>I was shocked to learn that she
    had no “real” education in web development, which for me at the time would equal
    nothing short of an academic degree. Everything she knew, she’d learned from MOOC
    platforms (Massive Open Online Courses), like freeCodeCamp and Codecademy.</p></li><li><p>She
    told me she had a background in finance, just like me. In fact, she had been working
    as a business controller for several years until just recently, when she’d joined
    the same startup as I had, just a few months earlier as a front-end intern.</p></li><li><p>When
    she showed me the portfolio page she’d built with just some six months of coding
    experience, I couldn’t believe it. It was incredible.</p></li></ol><p>That lunch
    opened up a world of possibilities for me. Sandra’s story made me hungry for more.</p><p>So
    for weeks I researched the different types of paths that people had taken to become
    developers. I ended up in all sorts of forums and articles, many of which I found
    right here on Medium.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey-faac8d3eb357\">Stackoverflow’s
    annual developer survey</a> (100,000 interviewees) stated that only half of all
    professional developers had a bachelor’s degree, and of this half, a whole third
    majored in something completely unrelated to computer science and software engineering.</p><p>The
    more I read, the more I realized how narrow my definition of education had been.
    If you didn’t need a computer science degree to break into something as complex
    as software engineering, what <em>did</em> you need an academic degree for? Although
    I might not have been able to see it then, I now clearly see how broken the academic
    system is.</p><p>It was designed for the industrial age of <em>workers</em>, where
    you’d specialize in one craft, and then use those same skills for the rest of
    your life. It was certainly not designed for today’s knowledge society, where
    all information of the history of the world is never more than a few clicks away,
    and where things change so fast that education must in fact be a life-long process,
    and not the learn-once-use-forever one-off experience.</p><p>But that’s a topic
    big enough for an article by itself. The important thing about that lunch with
    Sandra was that it ignited something in me, and motivated me to break free from
    the destructive loop that I found my current half-assed business career to be.</p><p>Although
    I’d always envied programmers around me — even to the extent that I’d taken a
    Python 101 summer course a few years earlier — I’d never considered it a viable
    career path for me. At least not without going back to university for 3 — 5 years.</p><p>So
    if you’re reading this Sandra, thank you! If I with this article can inspire just
    one person the way you inspired me, I’d consider the effort of writing it repaid
    a thousand times.</p><h2><strong>Part 3: The text that cost me $6,000</strong></h2><p>Over
    the next few months I spent hundreds of hours on online platforms like <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/\">Codecademy</a>
    and <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org\">freeCodeCamp</a>. I even purchased
    a subscription to the paid platform <a href=\"https://www.codeschool.com/\">Code
    School</a>.</p><p>I’m not sure I really knew what my goal was. What got me started
    was the desperation of my recurring career disappointments. But what kept me going
    was how ridiculously fun and rewarding I found the coding exercises to be.</p><p>I
    couldn’t even tell you at what point the coding turned from a casual side project,
    to the dead-serious “I’m going to be a professional developer.” But it was probably
    somewhere around here. I was just about to receive my front-end certificate from
    freeCodeCamp, when my next life-changing event occurred.</p><p>After quitting
    my job as a business developer, I’d decided to escape the freezing limbo that
    is Swedish winter to go travel in Central America. I reckoned that if I was gonna
    spend hundreds of hours alone, teaching myself coding, I might as well do it somewhere
    warm, cheap, and not depressing.</p><p>I was coding on my laptop in a hostel in
    El Salvador, when I got a text from my friend Marie.</p><p>“I got the job!” it
    said.</p><p>Marie was also learning how to code. I recalled how she, a few months
    earlier, had been telling me about this <a href=\"https://nycda.com/\">code school</a>
    she went to. A “coding bootcamp.”</p><p>At the time I’d basically mocked her for
    it — So. You’re gonna pay $5,000 for a 12 week course? And you’re not receiving
    a single university credit for it? And you dropped out of your top-tier MBA to
    do this? Sounds legit.</p><p>And yet there she was. Four months later, and Marie
    was officially employed by one of Accenture’s digital agencies as a junior back-end
    developer. I was really happy for her, but of course also extremely jealous.</p><p>I
    stopped what I was doing and made some calculations. If I could keep up my current
    pace, coding some 6 hours per day on average, about 5 days a week, I would do
    30 hours per week. So to finish freeCodeCamp’s full 1,200 hour program, it would
    take me at least 8 more months. And that’s <strong>if</strong> I could keep up
    the pace. Which I definitely couldn’t, since my money was running out and I would
    have to go back to Sweden and get a new job soon.</p><p>I kicked myself for not
    having taken the same road as Marie from the start, and spent my money on a bootcamp
    instead of backpacking for 4 months. Well, what’s done is done, I thought to myself.
    I’d still have to accept the fact that a bootcamp was the best option to reach
    an employable level fast enough.</p><p>Back to good old Google research.</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3168/0*AcV_N_-ErG9Ck9nc.\" alt=\"\"></p><p>In
    a way, I felt like I was right back where I started after that lunch with Sandra.
    Only this time, I looked at the whole bootcamp phenomenon with a fresh pair of
    eyes. Knowing Marie’s story, I knew that not all of them were too-good-to-be-true
    scams, but actually plausible ways to break into the industry.</p><p>Later on,
    <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey-faac8d3eb357\">Stackoverflow’s
    annual developer survey</a> again reassured me with the stats that 88.1% of coding
    bootcamp alumni had been hired within a year after finishing the bootcamp.</p><p>Thanks
    to <a href=\"https://www.switchup.org/research/best-coding-bootcamps\">Switchup</a>
    and <a href=\"https://www.coursereport.com/best-coding-bootcamps\">Coursereport</a>,
    it didn’t take long until I discovered <a href=\"https://www.lewagon.com/\">Le
    Wagon</a>, the French coding bootcamp startup success story with more than 15
    locations all around the world and top 5 ratings on both rankings (at the time
    of writing, actually #1 on both, with 27 locations!).</p><p>After comparing it
    with alternatives like Hack Reactor, Ironhack, General Assembly, and NYCDA, a
    few main reasons made me prefer it over the others:</p><ul><li><p>The relatively
    low price (back then $6,000).</p></li><li><p>The focus on entrepreneurship and
    product development.</p></li><li><p>The global presence and community.</p></li></ul><p>Nevertheless,
    I still had a few doubts about the program.</p><ol><li><p>The choice of the backend
    language Ruby and the MVC framework Rails. Although it appeared like this was
    pretty common among other recognized bootcamps, almost every article I read on
    the subject suggested that Javascript was <strong>really</strong> hot and what
    employers were looking for. My friend Marie’s bootcamp, for instance, taught a
    backend stack based on Node.js and Express.js. Both Javascript-based technologies.
    Some common arguments seemed to be that Ruby was a great language for learning,
    but that Node and Express were skills employers valued a lot higher. Was Ruby
    really the horse to bet on?</p></li><li><p>The 9-week duration of the course seemed
    a bit short. Most competing programs appeared to be at least 12 weeks, which already
    seemed way too short to become an employable web developer.</p></li><li><p>Le
    Wagon offered no actual job hunting assistance after completing the bootcamp.
    Many competitors offered either employment guarantees or seemingly solid career
    services functions.</p></li></ol><p>I’ll address each of these three doubts one
    by one with my post-bootcamp conclusions at the end of the next section.</p><p>However,
    despite my concerns I figured it was my best option, which is why I decided to
    apply to their school in Barcelona. A few days later the local school manager
    Gus reached out to me for a Skype interview.</p><p>Hooked up to a crappy Wi-Fi
    at a café in the lazy surftown of El Tunco we had a brief chat. But it was a lot
    more informal than I’d expected. I felt we connected, which made me want to get
    admitted even more. And then, not even 24 hours later, I got the email I’d been
    waiting for. Gus told me he would be pleased to have me in the next batch, and
    that the only thing I had to do next was pay the $1,200 deposit to reserve my
    place.</p><p>That was basically all the money I had left at the time, and it was
    supposed to pay for my last weeks in El Salvador — including the eventual trip
    home. But if I could just manage to stick to a tighter budget, and book an earlier
    flight home than expected, I knew I could make it.</p><p>So, after a brief moment
    of hesitation, and recalling the concerns I still held for Le Wagon, I acted on
    intuition, and transferred Gus the deposit. Afterwards, I remember feeling a bit
    awkward. Had I really just committed to paying almost $6,000 for a 9-week coding
    course? As a Swede, who’s never ever paid a single cent for education, the situation
    felt quite bizarre.</p><p>However, it didn’t take long until that bizarre feeling
    turned into excitement. At least now I knew I wouldn’t have to go back to working
    in finance, sales, or online media in any near future. The same day, I started
    making arrangements for the time up until the bootcamp.</p><p>In the three months
    left, I would somehow have to earn the remaining $4,800 of the fee. Plus rent
    and living expenses. Well sh*t.</p><p>I reached out to one of the companies that
    I’d previously consulted for, and luckily enough they had the perfect business
    analyst project coming up. Since they initially wouldn’t accept anything less
    than a 4-month contract, I had to convince them I could do the job in two. Somehow,
    it worked.</p><p>Phew! Just one week earlier, I’d been a runaway traveler without
    a thought of ever going home. Now, I was to start my new two-month gig in Stockholm
    in less than two weeks, and then move to Barcelona. Exciting things ahead indeed.</p><h2><strong>Part
    4: Bootcamp in Barcelona</strong></h2><p>Fast-forward three months.. It’s the
    1st of May 2017, and I’m in a classroom attending my first Le Wagon lecture.</p><p>Around
    me are some 25 people from all corners of the world. Kilian from Germany, Daniel
    from Venezuela, Francesca from France, Arbi from Italy, Courtney from the US,
    and so on. Some with no coding experience at all, some with a little, and a few
    actually halfway to getting their computer science degrees.</p><p>We’re listening
    to Gus, the local school manager, and Ruben, a Ruby teacher, explaining the structure
    of the program ahead.</p><p>As we all would come to learn, the schedule was very
    systematic. Over the coming 9 weeks, we would spend more or less an equal amount
    of time on 6 different modules, each dealing with a topic of its own, finishing
    up with two weeks spent on planning and developing our very own web app.</p><p>For
    the whole first week, I remember feeling quite confident about the course content.
    After all those hundreds of hours on freeCodeCamp, the difficulty level of the
    daily coding challenges seemed a bit low.</p><p>Although Ruby was still pretty
    new to me, the basics seemed to be pretty much the same as with Javascript and
    Python. Listening to lectures and doing exercises to learn about variables, arrays,
    hashes, basic functions, and iterations felt quite repetitive. So I got cocky,
    and wondered if I’d actually get anything out of this bootcamp thing. However,
    not even a week later, all that would change. I went from feeling like the top
    of the class to actually struggling to keep up.</p><p>Before I knew it, we were
    moving on from the basics to object-oriented programming, MVC architectures, and
    databases, and there were plenty of days when I felt I hadn’t even understood
    the concepts of the day before, and was already expected to move on to the next
    topic.</p><p>So I had to put in the next gear. 10 hours a day in the classroom
    wouldn’t cut it for me. I made it a routine to put in a few extra hours each night,
    and spend most of the weekends repeating the trickiest stuff from the past week.
    It sucked a bit to not be able to enjoy Barcelona as much as I had the first few
    weeks, but the fact that I’d invested all my savings into the bootcamp was a big
    motivation.</p><p>Another source of frustration was the scattered nature of the
    things we were learning. It felt like we’d been given a hundred puzzle pieces,
    but no instructions of how to put them all together. Knowing how to write basic
    Ruby, HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL was really empowering, but how would that
    knowledge help me put together an actual app?</p><p>And then came my big AHA moment.</p><p>It
    was week 6 and we’d finally reached the Ruby on Rails module. Before I knew it
    I was looking at my Chrome browser window and reading the words “Yay! You’re on
    Rails!”. That was my first web app, the teacher said.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2308/0*UvEfy8GWHurCtako.\"
    alt=\"Default landing page for any new Rails project.\"><em>Default landing page
    for any new Rails project.</em></p><p>What? All I’d done was run a few simple
    commands in my terminal and surfed onto <a href=\"http://localhost:3000/\">http://localhost:3000/</a>
    in my browser. What was I even looking at?</p><p>I wasn’t until I opened up the
    app directory in the text editor that that big sweet understanding fell into place.
    Rails displayed it all so beautifully simply.</p><p>One folder for the HTML, one
    for the CSS and Javascript, one for the controllers, and one for the models. One
    file for the routes. And one file for that sweet, sweet schema, mapping out the
    entire database like it wasn’t more complex than a grocery shopping list.</p><p>After
    finally getting the big picture of how all those pieces would practically fit
    together in an MVC framework like Rails, spending all my nights and weekends coding
    was not much of a struggle anymore. Quite oppositely, I would often struggle to
    get off my laptop to go to bed at night.</p><p>I was on a roll, getting massive
    new insights every single day. And it gave this intoxicating effect that’s still
    kind of hard to put down in words.</p><ul><li><p>So I can actually mix HTML and
    Ruby in my erb files?</p></li><li><p>I can access instance variables from the
    controller in the associated html.erb file?</p></li><li><p>I can import code that
    other people wrote using this thing called Gems?</p></li><li><p>I can write as
    much vanilla JavaScript as I want in the assets/javascript directory?</p></li><li><p>I
    can use the Rails console in the terminal to basically do whatever I want with
    the entire database?</p></li></ul><p>It was just a never-ending stream of incredibly
    satisfying Aha moments. Like you’d just realized the force was actually strong
    with you, and that you got one step closer to go full Jedi with each piece of
    new knowledge. Even now, nine months later, it feels like I’m still on that same
    high, and I’m starting to think it actually might be something permanent. How
    lovely that would be.</p><p>Anyhow, the bootcamp train wasn’t slowing down, and
    soon enough we’d reached the last two weeks, when we were supposed to build our
    own app. The two weeks would end with a big Demo Day, where each group would pitch
    and demo their apps in front of cameras and a big audience.</p><p>Pressure.</p><p>To
    our surprise, the planning turned out to be the most time-consuming part by far.
    Although we prepared a lot in the past few weeks — pitching app ideas, forming
    groups, designing features in Sketch — it wasn’t until after a few days of coding
    that we realized we’d been way too ambitious.</p><p>The initial idea for the app
    was sort of the “Happn for professional connections.” More specifically, letting
    users create pages for networking events that other users could attend and check
    in to. “But that’s Meetup,” you might be thinking. But our idea had a twist: you
    could only check in to an event if you were physically at the event location.
    Thus the “Happn for professional connections.”</p><p>Once checked in at an event,
    a user would be able to see the professional profiles of other checked in users,
    using data gathered through LinkedIn’s API, and connect and chat with the ones
    who matched their interests, thus not missing out on potentially great connections.</p><p>This
    was our initial MVP (minimum viable product) and we decided to call it Unify.
    Super corny and Silicon Valley wannabe, I know. But in our defence, we had better
    things to to with our time than think of better names.</p><p>Like brainstorming
    about the actual features. But then we actually brainstormed a bit too much, and
    features were added and removed until we ended up with a completely different
    app that,</p><ol><li><p>would never be demo-ready within the remaining ten days,
    and</p></li><li><p>wasn’t nearly as disruptive as we thought our first idea was.</p></li></ol><p>So
    we had to narrow down the features to the MVP, and actually ended up with almost
    exactly the same product that the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gdevita\">Le
    Wagon manager Gus</a> had recommended that we go with from the start.</p><p>Big
    waste of time, was what we thought then. But the process at least taught me a
    few really important things about product development:</p><ul><li><p>When done
    right, it should be a whole lot more about planning than actual coding.</p></li><li><p>Having
    to clean up old code mistakes is a lot more time-consuming than planning thoroughly
    and doing things right from the start.</p></li><li><p>The MVP is always smaller
    than you’d think from the start.</p></li></ul><p>Some ten days later, after more
    than 100 hours of coding, designing, arguing, testing, database migrations and
    database rollbacks, we’d somehow miraculously reached the Demo Day and actually
    felt pretty good about our app. Sure, it was far from perfect, but all the main
    features were actually working like we wanted them to.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3184/1*jNvyHKwkZmp6TBqzTMYJCA.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>However, just a few hours before the demo, we’d all nearly have
    a heart attack.</p><p>Google’s geolocation API wasn’t responding as it should
    to our requests, so we couldn’t check in to the event that we would use for the
    demo. We tried everything. Switching computers and users. Deleting and creating
    new events. Changing the event street address. Nothing worked.</p><p>The three
    of us tried to stay calm and not panic. It was probably just a bug the guy responsible
    for the geolocation feature would know how to solve easily.</p><p>But he was running
    late, so we tried calling him.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>We tried calling again.</p><p>No
    answer, again.</p><p>And then we panicked.</p><p>Not until the last minute, thanks
    to one of our amazing teaching assistants, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoineguilguet\">Antoine</a>,
    we managed to find the bug. Turns out we’d accidentally set the distance range
    too low, which was why the app couldn’t confirm that we were actually at the event
    location. We simply increased the radius by a few kilometers, committed, and pushed
    the change to our production server.</p><p>And voilà — the app worked perfectly.
    And so did the demo.</p><p>Overall<strong>,</strong> my Le Wagon experience was
    nothing short of amazing. I’ve probably never learnt so much in such a short time.
    In hindsight, it’s actually hard to believe that most of us were able to develop
    full-featured web apps with basically just 9 weeks of development experience.</p><p>But
    don’t fool yourself, the bootcamp will not do the work for you. To get anything
    out of it, you’ll have to give it your full commitment. I myself saw plenty of
    people fall behind or even drop out because they</p><ul><li><p>didn’t have the
    right expectations of the difficulty level,</p></li><li><p>weren’t prepared enough,
    or</p></li><li><p>were too busy with other things to keep up.</p></li></ul><p>On
    a final note, a mistake I think many rookies make is to consider a computer science
    degree a substitute to self-learning or a bootcamp, as a means of becoming a web
    and/or mobile developer. Based on my experiences, this is not accurate.</p><p>Even
    if you’re pursuing a computer science degree, you’ll still need to fill in a ton
    of practical knowledge gaps to become productive. I practically saw this first
    hand in my bootcamp classmates with 2 — 3 years of CS studies behind them. Again,
    that’s because the academic model is broken and outdated, and hence can’t keep
    up with the extreme pace with which real-world software development is changing.</p><p>From
    my point of view, if the goal is to become a developer, self-learning or a bootcamp
    will at some point be necessary either way. So a computer science degree should
    be perceived as a <strong>complement</strong> rather than a <strong>substitute</strong>.</p><p>And
    the reason why a (good) bootcamp can turn you into a developer faster than self-learning,
    is the combination of the following:</p><ul><li><p>a thorough but concise curriculum,</p></li><li><p>a
    seamless online platform with tutorials and exercises, and most importantly;</p></li><li><p><strong>the
    on-call support of a human when you hit a wall.</strong></p></li></ul><p>To conclude
    this section, I’d like to address the <strong>three</strong> concerns I had before
    committing to the bootcamp with the insights I’ve gained since then.</p><h3><strong>1.
    Learning Ruby on Rails instead of a JavaScript-based stack</strong></h3><p>If
    you’re currently in the position I was in before joining my Rails bootcamp, overwhelmed
    by all the JavaScript hype flooding the Internet, you might ask yourself if Ruby
    is a dated language, and if Rails is a dated framework. If this is the case my
    short answer would be no.</p><p>The long answer, however, would be this.</p><p>The
    company I’m working at now has a high-traffic web app built with Rails on the
    backend, and the Ember.js frontend framework on the front. Having worked full-time
    with this app for about six months now has required just as much coding in Javascript
    from me as in Ruby, which has brought me some insight into the differences and
    similarities between the technologies.</p><p>And sure, when it comes to client
    side HTML/CSS rendering (or the “views”), the Rails user experience isn’t even
    comparable to the big JavaScript frameworks. That I must give the Rails haters.</p><p>For
    instance, take a basic comment section of an article or blog post. As a user you’d
    expect any comments you submit to appear instantly on your screen.</p><p>In a
    modern JavaScript framework, this is simply a matter of pushing the new data (the
    comment) into the client side data store and making sure that the comment list
    updates its state to show the new comment. This way, you don’t have to wait for
    the new record to be sent all the way to the backend, stored in the database,
    and then requested by the client again. Instead the new comment appears instantly
    on your screen.</p><p>Without any JavaScript on top of your Rails HTML code, the
    user would have to refresh the page to see any new comments on the article. Which
    is just awful UX. To avoid this, you can take a few different paths.</p><p>Before
    the age of the JS frameworks, the main solution would be to sprinkle some quite
    unstructured AJAX logic on top of the HTML, which would often become very hard
    to maintain in the long run as your app gets bigger. Another option made available
    for Rails quite recently is the pubsub (publish-subscribe) websocket solution
    using something like Action Cable. For instance, this is what we used for the
    chat in the app we built in the bootcamp. The problem is just that without a wrapping
    JavaScript framework, the websocket logic can easily get unnecessarily complex,
    and also hard to maintain.</p><p>Luckily, however, today we have the much better
    option to use JavaScript frameworks for these types of problems. And since the
    client side in my opinion is the weakest point of Rails, this is also my main
    argument why Rails should not be discarded as an option to for instance Laravel
    or the MERN stack. Just smack a crisp JavaScript framework on top, like React
    or Ember, and you’re good to go.</p><p>I personally love our integration between
    Rails and Ember and how they complement each other. Their opinionated natures,
    solid track records, visionary leadership, and huge contributor communities make
    them stable, trustworthy, and suitable for junior developers like ourselves.</p><p>If
    you’re still, despite my best efforts, feeling hesitant about betting on Ruby
    as your first backend language, I’d like to remind you that I knew practically
    nothing about JavaScript six months ago (except for some basic vanilla JS, React,
    and jQuery syntax), and today I work with, and transition between, both of these
    languages and frameworks seamlessly on a daily basis. And love every minute of
    it (figuratively speaking).</p><p>So no matter what you bet on as your first language,
    don’t worry — you can always learn the second one on the job \U0001F60E</p><h3><strong>2.
    Aren’t 9 weeks too short to learn anything?</strong></h3><p>Regarding my concern
    that the duration of the bootcamp — a mere 9 weeks — might be too short to actually
    learn something valuable, Le wagon helped me bust that myth as well. In hindsight,
    it’s actually clear that I’d prefer 9 weeks over the 12 that most other bootcamps
    offer.</p><p>The reason is that the bootcamp itself doesn’t actually take you
    to an employment-ready level. At least not for me. Rather it provided me with
    a solid introduction to all the necessary tools I would require to reach a productive
    level, and how to put them all together. So even if they would have given me three
    more weeks, it would just have meant a dozen more tool introductions. Tools that
    I would later have to actually learn how to use in depth. And that list was already
    more than long enough.</p><p>It wasn’t until after the bootcamp, after weeks of
    building my own portfolio apps, that I understood how the tools really worked.
    So if you’ve decided that you want to do the bootcamp thing, but are comparing
    options based on a difference of a few weeks, my advice would be to remove that
    variable from the equation. Because if you’re anything like me, you will still
    have to relearn every single tool on your own.</p><p>Looking back, it’s actually
    quite remarkable how accurate Le Wagon’s toolset was. In my current job I use
    most of these tools daily. Some examples would be Postgres, Git, GitHub, Sidekiq,
    Pundit, Heroku and Cloudinary. The only two things that I wished my teachers would
    have spent more time on would be how to use a JavaScript framework like React,
    and how to write tests with technologies like Rspec. Because learning those two
    on my own later proved to be crucial for landing my first developer job.</p><h3><strong>3.
    Would a job guarantee and/or career services have helped me?</strong></h3><p>As
    I mentioned earlier, many bootcamps have a “get hired or get your money back”
    policy. And many more have a career services body, to help you get in touch with
    potential employers and coach you for applications and interviews.</p><p>And although
    this probably sounds like a sweet deal to many, I actually don’t think it would
    have made a difference for me. But then again, I also had the time to spend some
    500 hours coding over the two months following the bootcamp, the privilege of
    having an elite school degree on my resume, and a lot of experience in applying
    and interviewing for jobs. If these things don’t apply to you, maybe this is a
    factor to consider when choosing among bootcamps. I don’t know.</p><h2><strong>Part
    5: Building a portfolio</strong></h2><p>On the last of July this past summer,
    the bootcamp was over. But I was just getting started.</p><p>Developing the Unify
    app in the bootcamp and taking it across the finish line had given me a lot of
    momentum, and I was determined to make the most out of that momentum while it
    was there.</p><p>I still had some money left in the bank, and a few weeks left
    on the Barcelona apartment sublease. Basically everyone I knew in the city was
    leaving. So I had no reason at all to not just keep eating, sleeping, and dreaming
    code. Only half consciously I set up a few new routines and habits for myself:</p><ul><li><p><strong>I
    would code every single day</strong> until I reached my goal, which of course
    was getting that first developer job. Meaning Monday to Sunday, day and night.</p></li><li><p><strong>I
    would push every piece of code that I wrote to Github</strong>, the #1 place for
    potential employers to inspect your code skills and level of ambition. Even if
    I didn’t feel like I’d produced something worth committing, I’d still do it just
    to build onto that sweet green commit history for all the world to see.</p></li></ul><p><img

    Github commit history from <a href=\"https://github.com/charliejeppsson\">https://github.com/charliejeppsson</a>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>And
    I would immerse myself completely in as much software content as I possibly could</strong>.
    That meant listening to podcasts like <a href=\"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/\">Software
    Engineering Daily</a> and <a href=\"http://www.se-radio.net/\">SE Radio</a> whenever
    I was doing some errand, out running, or cooking. It meant watching code talks,
    tutorials, and lectures from Youtube channels like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtxCXg-UvSnTKPOzLH4wJaQ\">Coding
    Tech</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb\">Traversy Media</a>,
    and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/cs50tv\">CS50</a>. It meant reading
    Medium publications like <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/\">Hacker Noon</a>,
    <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/\">freeCodeCamp</a>, and <a href=\"https://codeburst.io/\">Codeburst</a>
    and magazines like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/\">Techcrunch</a> and <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/\">The
    Next Web</a>. And it meant installing <a href=\"https://kapeli.com/dash\">Dash</a>
    on my laptop, to always easily be able to look up the proper documentation on
    whatever syntax issue I was struggling with at any given moment (for me then mostly
    <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\">MDN web docs</a>, <a href=\"http://api.rubyonrails.org/\">api.rubyonrails.org</a>,
    and <a href=\"http://ruby-doc.org/\">RubyDocs</a>).</li></ul><p>In other words,
    my motivation to become a developer was stronger than ever, and I knew that having
    neither any academic or professional merits to show off, I would probably never
    even get called to a job interview unless I had a kickass portfolio. So that’s
    what I set my mind to do next.</p><p>The day after the Demo Day, barely sober
    from the night out that had followed, I started building my very first own Rails
    app (that’s how strong the momentum was!). Cocky as I was, I figured the first
    app would take a few weeks to finish, now that I’d already gone through it all
    one time with the Unify app. Again, I was wrong.</p><p>It would take me almost
    two months to finish it. There were so many processes in the last two weeks of
    the bootcamp that had gone by so fast, without me fully understanding them. I
    got stuck for several days on all kinds of stuff, from embarrassingly simple to
    somewhat advanced. Just configuring a datetime-picker required several days spent
    on Stackoverflow. Not to mention the chat feature, using websockets with Action
    Cable, which took me about two weeks to get right.</p><p>But the time invested
    was so worth it. The app actually turned out pretty great: it was actually something
    I could demo for people and feel proud. And although there’d been many moments
    of desperation I’d learned a ton. And in fact, experiencing all that hustle gave
    me a lot of comfort in that the bootcamp had probably been a good choice.</p><p>If
    it was this hard to code this stuff now when I was familiar with everything, how
    hard wouldn’t it have been if I hadn’t had the teaching assistants, the platform,
    and the curriculum when doing it all the first time?</p><p>So sometime in late
    August I finished the app. I was back home in Stockholm, living in my dad’s apartment,
    broke and feeling quite pathetic. I tried my best to use that self-pity to keep
    ramping up my coding efforts. And it was working pretty ok.</p><p>Soon enough
    the time came to code the actual portfolio website. And for once, I decided to
    keep it simple. So I put together a very minimalistic static web page where I
    could gather the stuff I’d done.* *After finishing it, my plan had been to start
    applying for jobs. But there was something that bothered me. Remember how I said
    that I’d been a bit hesitant towards Ruby on Rails before joining Le Wagon? Well,
    although I’d actually come to love Ruby’s minimalism and the simplicity of using
    Rails, I still felt like I’d taken a shortcut somewhere.</p><p>Under the “Skills”
    section on my portfolio page, one could find Ruby, Rails, SQL, Postgres, HTML/CSS,
    jQuery, Bootstrap, Sketch, Git, and Heroku. And JavaScript.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3194/1*_etYr1rOtqpK29ZbqqCtOw.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>It was the last one that bothered me. It felt like a lie.</p><p>If
    I started applying for jobs now, I could probably land something decent as a Rails
    developer. But what if all the haters were right, and Rails was actually outdated
    and dying? And what if I found my dream job, only to realize they used advanced
    JS technologies? I wouldn’t stand a chance with my 200 hours on freeCodeCamp and
    2 — 3 jQuery days + 1 React.js day at the bootcamp.</p><p>The hubris part of my
    brain spoke to me again - “Here’s an idea: what if I would learn the MEAN stack
    as well?” MEAN as in MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js, which is sort
    of like the JavaScript equivalent of what Rails is to Ruby. According to the search
    results on LinkedIn and Glassdoor, that would mean that I would more or less double
    the amount of developer jobs that I was qualified for.</p><p>I recalled that Gus,
    the bootcamp manager, had told me that it would take me about another month to
    learn it. How hard could it be? I could probably do it in two weeks, was my thought.</p><p>And
    that’s how I ended up in what I’d like to call <strong>the tutorial swamp</strong>.</p><p>So
    once again, I turned to my old friend Google to research learning strategies.
    But after a few hours I still couldn’t seem to find a good online course for my
    MEAN stack 101 needs. They all seemed to be focusing on one part at a time, which
    is definitely the right way to go if you want to understand a framework in depth.
    But since I wanted to learn as much as I could within two weeks, just enough to
    be able to add a new project to my portfolio, I didn’t have time for that.</p><p>That’s
    when I discovered a completely new dimension of development education: YouTube
    tutorials. There were so many out there. For every technology or stack I could
    think of, I found at least five decent tutorials.</p><p>Eventually I found my
    way to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA\">Traversy
    Media channel</a>, and the tutorial series <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uONz0lEWft0&list=PLillGF-RfqbZMNtaOXJQiDebNXjVapWPZ\">MEAN
    Stack Front To Back</a>. Ten videos at 20 minutes each, showing you how to build
    a basic RESTful web app with both user registration and sign-in authentication.
    Perfect.</p><p><center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries\"
    frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p><p>I started right away
    and coded along to each video on my laptop. And crazy enough, after just a few
    days I was done. I’d actually coded a fully functioning web app using completely
    foreign technologies. Node for the backend, Mongo for managing the database, Angular
    for the frontend, and Express for tying it all together.</p><p>Could it really
    be this easy? Did I know this stuff now? While I was happy that it had been so
    much easier than I’d thought, a cold shiver of too-good-to-be-true ran down my
    spine.</p><p>Well, since I was ahead of schedule, I figured, why not build onto
    the app a bit further? My idea was to turn it into a Medium clone, by just enabling
    basic blog post CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete), like we’d done in
    a project in the bootcamp with Rails.</p><p>I didn’t get very far, though. I figured
    I would just need to add a couple of new routes, models, controllers and views,
    and that would be it. The problem was that I was still thinking in the “Rails
    way,” where “convention over configuration” makes features like this really easy
    and fast to build.</p><p>As I’d read and heard plenty of times, the MEAN stack
    follows the opposite mantra: “configuration over convention,” meaning that you
    get a significantly more flexible framework by giving up some of the “magic” automations.
    Like getting a controller action of a certain name connected to a view with that
    same name, right out of the box. Which is a really sweet piece of magic to get
    when you’re a beginner.</p><p>So realizing for the first time how much harder
    it was to code following “configuration over convention” came as a big slap in
    the face. Because it proved that my hunch about the whole tutorial process having
    been too good to be true was right. But it wasn’t until I started coding off-script,
    without the comforting instructions from Brad Traversy, that I realized it.</p><p>So
    there I was, knee deep in the big pool of mud that was the MEAN stack to me then.
    The app was nowhere near ready to be added to my portfolio page. It literally
    had no features. Just the possibility for users to register, log in, and do nothing
    but look at some static Bootstrap designs.</p><p>Another option was to just keep
    hustling the trial and error way. Unlike the bootcamp, I’d removed my training
    wheels WAY too soon, and would likely have to spend weeks on Stackoverflow to
    be able to finish the app the way I’d planned it. I didn’t have weeks. I was supposed
    to start applying for jobs yesterday.</p><p>Ironically, it turned out the only
    way out of the tutorial swamp I’d put myself in, was to keep wading through it,
    by following more tutorials. Luckily, I found <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbYmJsLiPDVoDea3lfy7-E8O\">a
    pretty good one</a> on the same Youtube channel, and decided to use it as my lifeline.</p><p><center><iframe
    width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries\"
    frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p><p>And that’s how the
    web app that was supposed to be a Medium clone in the end became a music discovery
    app, using the Spotify Search API.</p><p>Despite all the hustle, two weeks after
    the decision to try and learn the MEAN stack, I actually deployed a decent web
    app. Which had been my goal. Sure, it was a bit like cheating, but I figured that
    as long as I could demo it and explain all parts of it on a job interview, nobody
    would care if I’d followed a tutorial or not.</p><p>Boom. All of a sudden I had
    three apps in my portfolio, and could add a bunch of new technologies to my skills
    repertoire. Finally, it was time to enter the next phase of my developer journey:
    the job hunt. And it was not a day too soon.</p><h2><strong>Part 6. Applying for
    jobs</strong></h2><p>All in all, it would take me about 4 weeks, 30 applications,
    10 interviews, and 3 offers to find that perfect fit. And ironically enough, it
    would actually be the first company I applied to that I would join. I could of
    course call it a coincidence, but I think it’s more an effect of a thorough screening
    process before even starting to send applications.</p><p>I’ll have to admit that
    I think a fair amount of luck played into my fast job hunt success. But for what
    it’s worth, I’ll describe the process I followed, as I think it taught me a few
    things about what jobs and companies to focus on for that first dev job.</p><p>The
    first thing I did was set up a spreadsheet for a shortlist of interesting jobs
    (I’m originally a dull economist, remember?). Then I spent several days scouring
    the job boards of LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Stackoverflow for jobs based on keywords
    like web, development, software, frontend, backend, Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Angular,
    Node, and Postgres.</p><p>Not very surprisingly, the searches returned hundreds
    of jobs just in the Stockholm area alone. The companies behind them ranged from
    startups to digital agencies, media companies, cloud service providers, game developers,
    and everything in between.</p><p>Over the past few months I’d managed to put together
    a pretty narrow set of criteria of what I wanted from my next employer.</p><p>If
    I could choose any job I wanted, my priorities looked more or less like the following:</p><ol><li><p>I
    would code across the whole stack, meaning that I’d get to do just as much database
    and architecture stuff as UX/UI stuff, and mainly in JavaScript. All the hype
    around React probably had a lot to do with the latter. Like I told you before,
    for all I knew at this point, Rails was basically dying, and JavaScript was the
    future.</p></li><li><p>My learning curve would be extremely steep, to the point
    that I’d have to code day and night to keep up. All to become as good as I possibly
    could in the shortest amount of time.</p></li><li><p>My coworkers would be smart,
    ambitious, funny, and informal, and preferably all at the same time.</p></li><li><p>The
    company would be a high-growth startup with a meaningful mission and a product
    related to blockchain, AI, and/or sustainability, or a top-tier digital agency
    with such projects.</p></li><li><p>I would get paid fairly.</p></li></ol><p>That
    was about it. Pretty high demands for a rookie one might think. But note that
    a high salary was not part of the criteria (nor is it today, with 6 months of
    professional experience). Maybe I’m stating the obvious, but if you’re migrating
    into a pure development role from something completely different, I think it’s
    important to know that it doesn’t matter what you were paid before.</p><p>For
    instance, I knew that my market value in the finance industry was about $5,000
    per month. But realizing that software development is a fundamentally different
    craft, I’d set my goal around $3,700, but would settle for as low as $3,000 (which
    is significantly lower than the Swedish average salary around $4,000).</p><p>With
    all the above criteria in mind, I’d start going through the job ads one by one,
    adding the ones I liked to my shortlist and abandoning the ones I didn’t. After
    a while I was noticing a few patterns:</p><p>Firstly, most companies on paper
    required way more tech skills and experience than I could offer. This came as
    no surprise. From both my own research and the bootcamp I’d learned that the “junior
    developer” position was dying.</p><p>That many companies considered it too expensive
    to spend the valuable time of senior developers on mentoring rookies. Which was
    why they prefered hiring senior developers, which are in very high demand but
    extremely low in supply.</p><p>The big paradox here is of course that if no one
    takes it upon themselves to foster and teach junior developers, how can we ever
    patch the shortage of senior developers on the market? Nevertheless, having realized
    that this is the way the industry works today, I also realized that I’d have to
    apply for positions I wasn’t qualified for.</p><p>Secondly, I saw that the hotter
    and bigger the company was, the more likely it was to include requirements of
    some computer science related degree and professional development experience.
    I reckoned that sure, a decent portfolio and cover letter could probably get you
    an interview with a company who requires a “Rails ninja” or “React superstar”
    rather than a novice like I was.</p><p>But if the job ad explicitly requires 3+
    years of professional JavaScript experience, and an MSc in a computer science
    related field, my chances of getting an interview are probably very slim.</p><p>Thirdly,
    that almost every single job ad mentioned React. Despite all the hype around it
    online, I was still amazed by its crazy high demand.</p><p>So amazed that I actually
    decided to spend a few hours a day building a small React web app, using React.js
    on the front and Rails on the back, so that I could add that to my portfolio and
    resume as well.</p><p>For this I actually mostly used the notes from the one React
    lecture in Le Wagon’s bootcamp, but if you’d be interested in learning it you
    won’t have a hard time finding free guides out there, not least the ones from
    freeCodeCamp.</p><p>Except for the fact that I could put React on my resume, the
    biggest benefit from this experience was getting comfortable with building a web
    app using components (as opposed to controllers and views, as is the Rails way),
    and working with props and state.</p><p>Odds are that you’ll need to become friends
    with some sort of JavaScript framework sooner or later, and then these concepts
    will come handy either way, be it React, Angular, Vue, Ember or any other of the
    gazillion JavaScript frameworks out there.</p><p>With new insights like the ones
    above, I could develop and refine the criteria I already had to determine whether
    a certain job should be added to my shortlist or not. Soon enough I had a list
    of some 50 job openings, and it was time to actually start sending out applications.
    Coming from a background where I’d applied and interviewed at hundreds of companies,
    this felt like the easiest part so far.</p><p>This might have something to do
    with me being the kind of person that writes one generic cover letter that I send
    to everyone. I know what you’re thinking: every mentor/teacher/recruiter you’ve
    ever talked to has advised against this. But come on. It’s a job application.
    Not the speech for your best friend’s wedding.</p><p>Odds are the recruiter won’t
    spend more than a minute on it anyway. So it won’t really matter if you mention
    that prize that the company won, or that you were impressed by the YoY growth
    last year, or your totally speculative opinion on why their culture is so much
    better than competitor X’s.</p><p>What matters is that you’re able to express
    in text the case why you’re worth them spending an hour on meeting you — in a
    compelling, data-driven, and grammatically flawless way. If you want to have a
    look at mine, just write me and I’ll send it to you! Got some pretty flattering
    feedback on it, just saying…</p><p>The next thing I did was update my CV and <a
    href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-jeppsson-71315661\">LinkedIn profile</a>.
    And here I can’t stress enough the importance of keywords. Make sure that the
    names of all the technologies you know (or want to pretend that you know) are
    included in both. This way, you’re more likely to appear in search results (same
    here, just ask me and I’ll send you my CV).</p><p>After sending all the applications,
    a week or so went by without me hearing anything from any of the companies. That
    actually turned out to be a well-needed period of rest for me. I took some time
    to reconnect with the friends and family I’d sort of neglected for the past few
    months, caught up by my new obsession.</p><p>Then I started getting replies.</p><h2><strong>Part
    7: Doing interviews</strong></h2><p><strong>The first reply</strong> came from
    a really young startup. It basically consisted of two guys, an ex-banker CEO and
    a senior developer CTO. The email was from the CTO, and he was inviting me to
    my very first developer interview.</p><p>Aware that the positive responses will
    always come before the rejections, I tried to keep a cool head and not get too
    excited.</p><p>But still, just the fact that this guy, a senior developer with
    10+ years of experience, had looked over my LinkedIn profile, cover letter, CV,
    and most importantly my portfolio and the code behind it on my Github profile,
    and still thought I might be able to write good code for them, made me feel pretty
    damn proud of myself.</p><p>Although I didn’t think the company actually met all
    my criteria (mainly due to the tiny team and poor salary outlook), I responded
    immediately and accepted the invite.</p><p>Despite all my efforts up to this point,
    I hadn’t spent much time actually preparing for <strong>the technical interview</strong>.
    But from what I’d heard and read it was supposed to be an art in itself, and in
    many cases something people would spend months preparing for.</p><p>Oftentimes,
    bootcamp alumni and self-taught coders with more practical experience will fail
    the technical interview due to their lack of knowledge in fundamental computer
    science theory. Just like CS grads will often fail due to their lack of experience
    with building apps with modern technologies.</p><p>But since I was running out
    of both time and money, I figured this too was something I’d have to learn by
    doing. I just couldn’t postpone the interviewing phase anymore. Just like I’d
    gotten burned many times when learning how to do the financial type of interview,
    I knew those burns were crucial for me finally figuring out how to <strong>win</strong>
    the interview. Why would the technical interview be any different?</p><p>So I
    accepted the invite, and a few days later I walked into the lobby of their office.
    They were waiting for me by the reception desk.</p><p>The place was a dump. If
    you’d ever seen The Office, it felt like I’d just stepped inside the office of
    the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. They told me it used to be an office for a big
    auditing company, remade into a cheap interim coworking space for the time left
    until its planned renovation. We stepped into a conference room and sat down by
    a big wooden table.</p><iframe src=\"https://medium.com/media/87b7d046d1182ebf99d652a679ecf94f\"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>They started off by telling me a lot about themselves
    and the company. They’d just released a beta version of a new Medium-ish app for
    prominent lifestyle writers, and had raised a bit of money from friends and family
    in their seed round. But they were still pre-launch, and most definitely pre-revenue.</p><p>After
    about an hour of what felt much more like a sales pitch than an interview, the
    CEO left and I was told that the CTO and I would continue for the technical part
    of the interview. My heart skipped a beat. From all that I’d read about technical
    interviews I expected to get all sorts of brain teasers, coding challenges, and
    questions on complex data structures thrown at me.</p><p>But none came. Instead,
    the CTO starting asking me all these very open-ended questions.</p><p>Like what
    technologies and frameworks I liked. If I could choose any new technology to learn
    next, what it would be. What I thought about the new syntax introduced by <a href=\"http://es6-features.org/\">ES6</a>
    (the 2015 Javascript update, introducing a lot of new cool stuff like arrow functions,
    promises, and constants).</p><p>We had a nice conversation that lasted for probably
    another half hour. But then came the big backlash, when the CTO decided to put
    all the cards on the table.</p><p>Due to their tight financial situation, he told
    me, they could only offer me a 6-month internship role with symbolic pay for now
    (meaning practically no pay). If the internship went well, however, they were
    very open to offering both equity and decent pay.</p><p>“If the company is still
    around by then,” I almost added.</p><p>Although I was flattered that they’d made
    me an offer on the spot, I knew instantly that this was neither the company nor
    product I was looking for. Nevertheless, I didn’t turn them down right away. An
    offer is still an offer, I thought, and can always come handy when negotiating
    with other companies later on.</p><p>Despite the disappointment about both the
    job, and the fact that the technical interview hadn’t really taught me anything
    new, I’d still received an offer, which gave me a big confidence boost for the
    interviews to come.</p><p><strong>The second response</strong> I got was from
    a slightly larger startup called Teamtailor. They were a Stockholm-based company
    with a mission to digitize the recruiting and employer branding industry, currently
    ruled by quite non-technical recruitment consultants and HR managers.</p><p>Not
    a bad idea. Although job ads starting with words like “recruitment” and “HR” 9
    days out of 10 would’ve scared me away, there was something about this company
    that intrigued me.</p><p>From my pretty thorough research I’d found that they’d
    been around for about 4 years, had some 30 employees, presence in 4 or 5 countries,
    600 customers (businesses), a 100%+ revenue growth rate, and breaking even with
    some margin on top. Not bad at all.</p><p>To top it all off, their instagram account
    revealed their office: a brooklyn-ish old red brick beer factory in the middle
    of Södermalm, the best area Stockholm has to offer.</p><p>M. M. Mmm.</p><p>Everything
    pointed towards the fact that they were in that sweet spot of the company life
    cycle. Young enough to be able to make you feel like you’re on a journey together,
    with an informal culture and lots of room for initiative and growth. But still
    old enough to have established some structures, which can be nice to lean on when
    you’re learning something new.</p><p>Anyway. Again, it was the CTO that wrote
    to me. After a few messages back and forth we settled on a first interview in
    their office a few days later. I was told that both he and another co-founder
    would be meeting with me.</p><p>Before even meeting with any of them, I had a
    really good feeling about the whole thing. Which was bad. At least in my head.
    Because now I would enter the interview probably wanting them more than they wanted
    me, I thought. After walking up the stairs of the old beer factory, I finally
    reached the door to their office and stepped right into a rather special scene.</p><p>First,
    a big pink poster right in my face, with bold white letters screaming at me: “Teamtailor
    is one of Europe’s 100 hottest startups - Wired Magazine.” To my left what looked
    like a living room, where a bunch of 20-somethings were playing FIFA on a huge
    screen. In front of me a bigger room, where the table closest to me was filled
    with developers, casually hacking away on big crisp screens. And all around me,
    soft hiphop beats pulsating from Sonos speakers.</p><p>Right in that moment, any
    bad prejudice I’d held against them for being an HR company disappeared. This
    place was awesome. Dammit.</p><p>You can say a lot of bad things about the typical
    Silicon Valley wannabe office. But in my opinion, even the worst office of this
    kind will still be a thousand times better than the typical corporate counterpart.
    So for me it was heaven. Which was really bad for my attempted coolness for the
    interview.</p><p>A tall skinny guy with a baseball cap smiled at me and got up
    from his chair to greet me. It was the CTO. We stepped into a conference room
    with glass walls and green fake grass covering the floor. The other co-founder
    joined us and we kicked off the interview.</p><p>Unlike my last interview, they
    started off by telling me about the process I was in. The purpose of this first
    meeting was mainly to get to know me better. If I proceeded, the second step would
    be a technical interview. I was so relieved to hear that. The imposter syndrome
    was real.</p><p>The first question was more or less the classic “Why do you want
    to be a developer?” They told me that more than anything else, it was my cover
    letter and CV that had caught their eye. Finding business-minded developers was
    rare, and finding developers with business degrees and experience from both business
    development and finance even rarer. So why had I decided to hop off my path to
    pursue this totally different one?</p><p>From interview experience, I’ve learned
    that honesty is almost always the best way to go in these cases. So I basically
    told them what I told you in the beginning of this article, that I hate selling,
    love technology, and wanted to transition into the creative side of things.</p><p>From
    this point forward, the conversation sort of got its own life. At one point, I
    told them that if I’d known the things that I know now, I’d probably had chosen
    to study computer science instead of business. To my surprise, the CTO was surprised
    by this remark. He laughed and asked me why.</p><p>I hesitated. I realized it
    was one of those things I’d said because I thought it’s what they wanted to hear.
    He let me off the hook, and told me that he was also a self-taught developer.
    The only subject he’d taken in uni was film studies. I was a bit shocked by that.
    But there was more to it.</p><p>As a matter of fact, none of the 10 developers
    at the company had a real CS degree. A few of them had taken a year or two of
    some private web development program, but most were actually self-taught.</p><p>Hearing
    that from this guy made me so happy. He’d just confirmed what my former colleague
    Sandra had told me a year earlier - <strong>that you don’t need a degree to become
    a great developer.</strong> Good stuff.</p><p>The conversation kept going so smoothly
    that it wasn’t until the last few minutes when they asked me about my portfolio.
    Only one of them had actually looked at it, and he literally said he’d just “had
    a glance.” All caught up by how well the interview was going, I told them I would
    be happy to demo one of my apps.</p><p>Immediately, their faces lit up and they
    straightened in their chairs, nodding me on. I was about to realize that I’d just
    made a BIG mistake.</p><p>The only app that was nearly good enough to show to
    these guys was the one that I’d made over the month straight after the bootcamp.
    And I hadn’t touched that one for at least a month. I hooked up my MacBook to
    the big screen in front of us, and entered the URL in the browser.</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3192/1*kOQ0yaosL0yxWCGQl6IH5g.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>The first embarrassment was that it literally took 20 seconds
    to load the home page. With a dry throat I tried to explain that I was using the
    free version of Heroku, which meant that whenever the server associated with the
    domain didn’t receive any requests for more than an hour, it would go into this
    “sleep mode,” from which it took a long time to wake up. The last thing I wanted
    was them to think my app was slow.</p><p>When it had actually loaded I took some
    time to explain the idea behind the product. It was basically a service for creating
    virtual lines, allowing organizations like airlines, banks, and hospitals to set
    up queues online instead of in their physical locations.</p><p>Then came the second
    embarrassment. When I tried logging in on my account using Facebook authentication
    it failed. As I would realize much too late, the reason was that I hadn’t updated
    the URL in my Facebook API settings after getting a new SSL certificate. So Facebook
    was expecting requests from an http://domain, while mine came from an https://
    domain. Rookie mistake.</p><p>I finally managed to log in manually instead, and
    demoed some of the main features without any issues. But then came the biggest
    embarrassment of them all. I couldn’t seem to get the crown jewel of my app to
    work: the chat. When I clicked the chat link, I got to the chat page, but couldn’t
    see any of my fake users to chat with.</p><p>Then I basically gave up. Which I
    really shouldn’t have. Because just a few hours later, I would realize that the
    chat worked perfectly fine. My user account simply hadn’t signed up for any lines
    to participate in, which is why I couldn’t see any users to chat with either.</p><p>We
    said our goodbyes and they told me they would be in touch. I left the interview
    feeling angry and disappointed. Why hadn’t I prepared better for the demo? It
    had all gone so smoothly until that last part.</p><p>Nevertheless, not even an
    hour would pass until David wrote me again. He told me I had proceeded to the
    next step of the process. I couldn’t believe it and I couldn’t have been happier.
    But of course, also a bit scared about taking on my first real technical interview.</p><p>In
    the end, however, this second interview would also turn out to be nothing like
    all the horror stories I’d read about online. Already in the invite email, the
    CTO told me that I would be meeting with two of their senior developers, and that
    they simply wanted me to show off one my apps more thoroughly, along with the
    code behind it.</p><p>The main purpose would be to get a grip of how well I knew
    their backend framework (Rails), and how fast I could be able to learn their frontend
    framework Ember.js (which I hadn’t even heard about at this point).</p><p>I knew
    instantly that the demo app would have to be the one that I’d built using Rails
    and React.js. It was perfect for two reasons:</p><ol><li><p>it was built on Rails
    integrated with a JavaScript framework (just like their stack), and</p></li><li><p>I’d
    learned all the React stuff I used in less than two weeks, which would give them
    a good sense of how fast I could learn Ember.</p></li></ol><p>This case is a perfect
    example why it can actually pay off to not put all your eggs in one basket when
    you’re building your portfolio, but actually try out a few different stacks.</p><p>Soon
    enough the big day came, and I was back in their office in another of their fake-grass-floor
    conference rooms. I started off showing the UI flow of the app.</p><p>I surfed
    onto <a href=\"https://app-hunt.herokuapp.com/\">t</a>he web app, and soon enough
    the working title “AppHunt” lit up on the screen in big bold purple letters. It
    was sort of like Product Hunt, but more like a market place strictly for apps.
    So any user would be able to browse the home page for apps for sale and for purchase.
    And if they created an account and logged in, they would also be able to search
    and filter the app items, rate them, and write stuff in the comment fields. That
    was basically it.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3194/1*ZFKoxbeTYZ2FdXh8dIxmcA.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>But fortunately for me, it was enough. The two senior developers
    apparently liked what I showed them so much that they gave the CTO the thumbs
    up. They later told me a few things that they liked specifically:</p><ul><li><p>That
    the real-time features — like changes in the comments, search results, and ratings
    appearing instantly — showed that I knew how to use state and props, which is
    crucial in any JavaScript framework.</p></li><li><p>That I used JBuilder to serialize
    the JSON requests between frontend and backend.</p></li><li><p>That I used Elasticsearch
    for the search feature.</p></li><li><p>That they liked the design and that I’d
    made my sketches myself in Sketch before starting to code.</p></li><li><p>That
    the CSS code wasn’t very contextually styled or nested. Instead they found much
    of it reusable throughout the entire app, which was good. One thing that would
    have made them even more impressed though, they told me, would have been if I’d
    followed the so-called <a href=\"http://getbem.com/naming/\">BEM CSS naming</a>
    convention as well.</p></li></ul><p>It wasn’t until a few weeks after the second
    interview that the CTO reached out to me again with an offer. After some discussions
    back and forth we settled on a probationary period of 6 months, with a $3,300
    monthly salary that would be boosted to my $3,700 target when I reached a productive
    level.</p><p>I accepted on the spot and started my new job the next week. ✌️</p><iframe
    src=\"https://medium.com/media/1b52e75713c9bfd458cd0c0f091f3f4a\" frameborder=0></iframe><p><strong>In
    parallel with the whole Teamtailor process,</strong> I interviewed for 4 other
    companies as well. The most noteworthy was the Swedish fintech phenomenon iZettle,
    which is sort of an umbrella of several different financial products, but where
    their wireless card terminal is probably the one they’re most known for.</p><p>As
    this successful startup was approaching a unicorn valuation, I’d learn that their
    demands on experience and skill level were significantly higher than the smaller
    startups that I’d interviewed for up to this point. I saw it both in the much
    more thorough recruitment process they had (5 interviews!) and the difficulty
    level of the interview questions.</p><p>The main reason a rookie like me even
    got an interview there in the first place I’d say would be largely due to the
    recommendation from a friend and the name of the business school I graduated from.
    So I sort of cheated my way in, I’d say. But I was so obviously not prepared for
    them.</p><p>Just like with the other companies, the first interview was all fluff
    and soft skills. But even more “HR” this time. Why do you want to work as a developer?
    What technologies do you like using? What are your strengths/weaknesses? And so
    on. Easy stuff.</p><p>The second interview, however, would turn out to be a quite
    traumatic experience. It all started with me sitting down in a conference room
    with two of their web developers. We repeated the whole “get to know each other”
    conversation and I was getting pretty comfortable and confident. And then I got
    the biggest sucker punch of my life.</p><p>Out of nowhere the guy across the table
    handed me a huge white A3 paper and a pen. He told me they wanted me to draw a
    sketch of the data flows and processes involved in the following scenario:</p><blockquote><p>“A
    small business owner has an account with iZettle and uses their card terminal.
    After one of his/her own customers has made a purchase using the terminal, he/she
    wants to log onto the web app and/or mobile app to see the transaction.”</p></blockquote><p>This
    really caught me off guard, but I hesitantly nodded and accepted the challenge.
    Then the guy said something like: “We’ll just go and have a coffee, and then in
    5 minutes or so we’ll come back and let you explain your thoughts.”</p><p>5 minutes!
    Was that a joke? I really couldn’t tell. When they’d left, I seriously considered
    if this was some sort of trick question, where I was supposed to realize that
    this task was just too big to perform decently in such short time. But time was
    already running out and it was too big of a risk. So I decided to give it a shot.</p><p>In
    hindsight, I realize that it was a system design question, meaning that they wanted
    me to basically just map up an overall view of how the web app and mobile app
    made requests to some API that connected them to the server(s) and database (if
    you want to improve your system design skills, I’d really recommend <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-vYrOAmtrx9sBzJAf3x_xw\">this
    Youtube channel</a>).</p><p>But I did none of that. In my state of panic, I skipped
    ahead several steps, and started trying to sketch the database model of the user
    account, with a table, columns and foreign keys (I assumed that they used a relational
    database). When I was done with that, I had about 30 seconds left to map up the
    other components of the architecture. I was so stressed that I got all philosophical,
    and started questioning what the actual roles of the API and server were. Not
    a good sign.</p><p>5 minutes passed, and the two developers returned to a sketch
    barely worthy of a 5-year-old. I’d basically just drawn three circles. One to
    the left, representing the database, and two to the right, representing the web
    and mobile app clients.</p><p>Of course, I failed the interview miserably. Which
    was also the reason I didn’t move on to a third one. However, they let me down
    easy, telling me that they liked me and that I should apply again when I had one
    or two more years of experience.</p><p>The whole experience bummed me out, as
    I didn’t think I’d gotten a chance to show them my practical skills. Although
    I can kind of see that there’s some sort of value in being able to illustrate
    system architecture on a piece of paper, I really think that there’s a thousand
    times more value in being able to show your skills with a practical exercise,
    like a coding challenge or app demo. But hey, there’s a lesson to be learned in
    every failure, right?</p><p><strong>All in all</strong>, during my 4 weeks of
    job hunting I ended up attending 11 interviews for 6 companies, of which 3 made
    me offers. So despite getting burned a few times, it was really an amazing experience.
    If I was asked to name the one single biggest reward (except for getting my dream
    offer), it would be that <strong>I got comfortable with talking to developers
    about software</strong>. If you’re suffering from the imposter syndrome like I
    did (look it up, it’s a thing), there’s simply no better way to treat it.</p><p>Another
    key takeaway is that out of my 11 interviews, only <strong>one</strong> turned
    out to require actual theoretical computer science knowledge. No questions on
    complex data structures, no devious brainteasers. Just one question on system
    architecture. The rest were 100% centered around either practical or soft skills.
    So unless you’re applying for a flashy software engineering job at Google or Facebook,
    I’d definitely recommend to focus on the practical stuff, and learn the theoretical
    stuff later.</p><p>Lastly, I’d like to stress the fact that I didn’t know anyone
    involved with the company that I ended up getting hired by. I know there’s a lot
    of content out there claiming that a strong personal network is the single most
    important factor to land the first dev job. And although that might be true statistically,
    cold-applying without a referrer is definitely not a waste of time.</p><h2><strong>Part
    8: What I do today</strong></h2><p>At the time of writing, I’ve been working at
    <a href=\"https://www.teamtailor.com/en\">Teamtailor</a> for six months. And time
    really has flown by quicker than I could’ve ever imagined. I’ve barely even noticed
    the long, dark, and freezing winter that’s usually a struggle to endure here in
    Stockholm.</p><p>I’m part of a team of 12 people, where everyone except for one
    designer are full stack Rails and JavaScript developers. A few have 10+ years
    of experience, some just a few years, but only two hold actual academic tech degrees.
    The rest of us are more or less self-taught.</p><p>I spend my days hacking away
    on our Rails/Ember platform, every day trying to leave the app a little bit better
    than I found it the same morning. The product itself is a recruitment web app
    that lets companies build and manage their own career sites, effortlessly and
    completely without requiring any coding skills.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5760/1*pWN7XQdBQiGT2NmcXPHKpg.png\"
    alt=\"[https://career.teamtailor.com](https://career.teamtailor.com/)\"><em><a
    href=\"https://career.teamtailor.com/\">https://career.teamtailor.com</a></em></p><p>In
    turn, the app behind this career site has two main dimensions:</p><ol><li><p>It
    lets users handle the employer branding meant to attract talent, with means such
    as job posts, social media content, a blog, images, videos and gifs.</p></li><li><p>It
    offers a massive set of tools to handle the traffic and applicants — like tracking
    candidates, chatting, emailing and texting them, evaluating them with tests, setting
    up automatic triggers to execute some action when a candidate is moved from one
    stage to another, and promoting job ads on all the major job boards to name a
    few.</p></li></ol><h3><strong>How we work</strong></h3><p>In our product team,
    we try our best to follow the agile principles of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29\">Scrum</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.everydaykanban.com/what-is-kanban/\">Kanban</a>, and pair
    programming. Practically, for us this means we carry out our work in cycles, where
    we split up the implementation of new features into projects running for 6 weeks
    at a time. In turn, each project has developers paired up two-and-two, and made
    responsible for shipping the new features within those 6 weeks. The pairs deploy
    their work continuously, based on a predefined Trello board of smaller tasks within
    each planned feature.</p><p>Of course, we don’t just build new stuff. We also
    maintain the app. And at the core of this maintenance we have what I believe is
    a pretty unusual routine: *<em>the “tech-on-call” duty. *</em>This means a weekly
    rotating position where each developer in turn spends one whole week assisting
    our users and support staff on <a href=\"https://www.intercom.com/\">Intercom</a>.</p><p>If
    you think this sounds like an annoying and frustrating task, it was. Until we
    decided that each tech-on-call would pause all their other projects while on support
    duty. Then all of sudden, when I no longer felt like every minute spent on Intercom
    was a minute stolen from my projects and deadlines, I actually started enjoying
    it.</p><p>Think about it - when you just take the time to listen, you realize
    that you basically have an army of volunteering quality assurance testers at your
    disposal, always ready to give instant feedback on the product’s actual UX and
    user pain points. Considering this, suffice it to say that I’ve learned just as
    much from my tech-on-call weeks as any other project or bug that I’ve been working
    on.</p><p>Lastly, in between each 6-week cycle, we take two weeks to make a common
    effort to squash all the bugs lined up in our Trello bug board. We also use these
    two weeks to develop pitches for new features that we ourselves would like to
    see in the app. Every developer then gets the chance to pitch these ideas in a
    shared pitch meeting that we have every 8 weeks, which is really empowering for
    someone who’s not just looking to solve tough code problems, but also business
    problems through new cool additions to the existing product.</p><h3><strong>What
    I’ve done so far</strong></h3><p>Although the app includes so many features and
    technologies that in the beginning were completely foreign to me, I was thrown
    right into the middle of the action already in my second week. The onboarding
    process — meaning me having a senior developer show me the ropes — lasted only
    five days. After that first week, in theory, I was supposed to be more or less
    autonomous.</p><p>This meant I was expected to understand the architecture of
    the platform, the dev toolkit, the team’s workflow, our style guide, how to provide
    tech support to users and colleagues, and other internal routines for developing,
    testing, debugging, reviewing and deploying code. In other words, a LOT of new
    stuff for someone who just came out of a bootcamp.</p><p>If you’re panicking right
    now because you think I actually learned all that in a week, relax. I definitely
    didn’t. It wasn’t until after a few months that I started getting comfortable
    with most of that stuff. And with time, the others would notice, and I would be
    trusted with more and more responsibility. Since then I’ve gotten to be a part
    of some of the most exciting and challenging projects I’ve ever worked on.</p><p><img

    alt=\"My candidate profile with some fetched social media URLs in the gray box.\"><em>My
    candidate profile with some fetched social media URLs in the gray box.</em></p><p><strong>The
    first serious one</strong> was updating the method we used to fetch information
    about users who signed up on our app with just an email. We’d already integrated
    with a third party API for this, that we made requests to to get data like full
    names and URLs to social media profiles and avatar pictures.</p><p>However, since
    we’d found the fetched data to often be incorrect, the product team had decided
    to switch to another provider. Since it would expose me to several crucial areas
    and data flows of the app, it was the perfect next step for me.</p><p>To implement
    it, I would have to navigate all the way from getting the email from the user
    input at the very front of the client layer, to understanding how the data would
    travel from the Ember frontend, through adapters and serializers to the Rails
    backend and ultimately get stored in the database.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5756/1*EmLUf9ojRAdW7CPmy0Asxw.png\"
    alt=\"An example of how the call to action button can be used on a career site.\"><em>An
    example of how the call to action button can be used on a career site.</em></p><p><strong>My
    second own feature</strong> was developing what we call the “call to action button,”
    meaning that we’d allow our users to add custom buttons to their career sites
    in our editor tool.</p><p>For instance, we wanted to let them redirect to the
    page of a certain job opening, a certain department, or some completely external
    URL. This actually turned out to be a lot easier than I’d expected. Most of the
    backend architecture was already in place, so all I had to do was basically create
    a few new Ember components and add them to the other options in the career site
    editor.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3380/1*yqAMm_2bx322DeVFoK7rxQ.png\"
    alt=\"The modal form for our new automated candidate testing feature.\"><em>The
    modal form for our new automated candidate testing feature.</em></p><p><strong>The
    third feature I worked on</strong> was enabling our users to integrate with external
    assessment providers, meaning they would be able to send candidates to a test
    platform like Hackerrank. When they’d finished a test, the results would automatically
    be sent through an integration between our and the provider’s APIs. This was a
    big one, so I mostly acted as an assistant to the senior developer (aka the Ember
    grandmaster of our team) responsible for the project. Still, it taught me tons
    about how to properly set up an API integration and automating workflows with
    triggers.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5760/1*e_cXoRdBAVxd4oOf7FRESw.png\"
    alt=\"One of the pages in the Employees section, rewritten in Ember.js.\"><em>One
    of the pages in the Employees section, rewritten in Ember.js.</em></p><p><strong>My
    fourth project was the biggest to date,</strong> and for good <em>and</em> bad
    I ended up doing it more or less on my own. The entire app had originally been
    built in Rails, and most views had been rewritten with JavaScript and Ember one
    by one. Only one of our main sections of the app still had just Rails views. It
    was the so-called “Employees” section, which was basically the main destination
    for creating, editing, and deleting user accounts. So it was kind of important
    that my translation to Ember was flawless.</p><p>Which stressed me out like crazy.
    Since I’d been on the team for about three months at this point, I figured it
    was time to stop acting like some annoying intern and start working more independently.
    Meaning I tried to bother the others with as few questions as I possibly could.
    The good thing about this was that I got a lot of confidence in my ability to
    solve real-world software problems completely on my own. The bad thing, however,
    was that it made me super slow, and that it took me a good 6 weeks to ship the
    full rewrite of more than 2,000 new lines of code.</p><p>In the end, this actually
    even proved to be the main reason why I didn’t get the raise that the CTO and
    I had agreed on, since I hadn’t fulfilled my end of the bargain: <strong>I hadn’t
    reached a productive level in line with the rest of the team</strong>.</p><p>Although
    this sucked at the time, I now realize that his standpoint was completely fair,
    and it taught me an important lesson. In the world of Agile software development,
    lone wolfing isn’t an option. Teamwork is a major part of finding a productive
    workflow.</p><p><strong>The fifth project</strong> is the last to date, and we
    actually just shipped it. It was our new feature to handle the emerging new European
    data privacy legislation (GDPR). For us that translated into building tools that
    made it easier for our customers’ candidates to have their personal data deleted
    from our database, and also for our customers to ask the candidates for permission
    to store and keep storing their data.</p><p>Sounds pretty straightforward right?
    Well, it wasn’t. At all.</p><p>I think the main reason was that we couldn’t focus
    on a single destination of the app. Instead, the feature required us to add stuff
    all over the place. Notifications in one place, warning flags in another, search
    filters and bulk actions in a third, and dozens of new email sendout actions everywhere.</p><p>For
    the first time since I started, I was paired up with the senior developer and
    co-founder that onboarded me. So I felt it was really important for me to show
    him how much I’d learned since that first week six months earlier. My probation
    period was about to end, and they would soon have to make a decision if I was
    good enough to keep on the team. And with this “simple” project, I first figured
    proving that would be a piece of cake.</p><p>Oddly enough though, I think the
    complexities made our pair-programming sessions even better. There were so many
    user scenarios to take into account when designing each part of the architecture,
    that we were forced to discuss and twist and turn every new block of code. For
    the first time, I’d have to take into account not only the UI/UX dimension, but
    also extensive legal considerations, that could cause a lot of trouble for our
    users if we didn’t implement it correctly.</p><p>So we pair-programmed a lot,
    and it was really great. When I coded, he came with a lot of good feedback that
    mostly made my code a lot cleaner. But unlike that first onboarding week, I was
    actually also able to give feedback on his code, making suggestions and asking
    questions that really made his code better as well.</p><p>When you’re in a state
    of intense development, like I’ve been for the past year, I think it’s hard to
    quantify how much your skills have improved at any given moment. So being able
    to give constructive feedback to this guy, with 15+ years of coding under his
    belt, really put the writing on the wall for me.</p><p>And by the way, so did
    the extension of my 6-month probationary employment contract, which I was just
    recently made aware of. From now on, I’m a regular full-time employee, with the
    salary I initially requested six months ago \U0001F603 \U0001F389</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6834/1*5psEOdmkuHRuyZ53GR64pw.jpeg\"

    9: Why becoming a developer is the best thing I’ve ever done</strong></h2><p>As
    you’ve probably figured out by now, I’m in love with coding.</p><p>I love that
    it keeps forcing me to push my intellectual limits through quantitative problem
    solving.</p><p>I love that it provides me with an outlet for creative expressions
    when designing anything from UI to system architecture.</p><p>I love that it provides
    me with a thousand different solutions for every real-world problem.</p><p>I love
    that it not only tolerates my inner perfectionist, but actually requires that
    perfectionist to be present — and punishes its absence.</p><p>I love that it surrounds
    me with people that value genuineness and transparency above small-talk and politeness.</p><p>I
    love that, on my introverted days, it lets me put on my headphones, roll up my
    sleeves, and deep dive into another dimension for a while.</p><p>I love that it
    always holds something new for me to learn, and that it will require me to be
    a lifelong learner, unlike many other stagnant professions.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>But
    most of all, I love that coding has given me a sense that the future is truly
    limitless.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>In a few weeks I’ll turn 27, and I
    have no idea what the future holds for me. In three years, for all I know, I might
    still be in the same position as I am now, writing code for the same company.
    I might be a lead developer. I might be a product owner or manager. Or I might
    be somewhere completely different.</p><p>Freelancing remotely from a sunny paradise.
    Developing decentralized apps on some disruptive blockchain. Designing machine
    learning models to combat global warming. Writing spaceship algorithms for expeditions
    to Mars. Or building my own product.</p><p>All of the above scenarios would have
    seemed utterly crazy to me before I started coding.</p><p>At best, my former finance
    jobs gave me the slim satisfaction of having put together a thick powerpoint presentation
    filled with upward-sloping KPI curves. And the best possible future scenario I
    could think of then was me landing a CFO or CEO position at some listed company
    after dedicating a decade of my life into 100-hour work weeks at some investment
    bank, private equity firm, or management consultancy, having spent my days around
    people who cared more about money and prestige than trying to do something meaningful
    with their lives. And that scared me.</p><p>Today, there’s no likely future scenario
    that scares me at all. And that alone gives me certainty that my crooked journey
    over the past three years has had a purpose.</p><p>Although it’s a bit sad that
    I invested so much time and energy into a career path that turned out to be a
    dead end, I know I was really fortunate to realize that already at age 23 — and
    to have the luxury to be able to make a halt, look around, and pursue something
    I felt more passionately about.</p><p>So good or bad, I guess it was the sum of
    all my experiences that took me to where I am today. A place where I somehow managed
    to find something few people ever do — <strong>a job that I love</strong>. And
    for that I’m more thankful than words can say.</p><p><em>Congrats! Since you made
    it all the way through this VERY long article, you must be just as crazy as I
    am. I originally had two intentions with this text: to process my failures and
    successes of the past three years, and to inspire others on paths similar to mine.
    I consider the first one completed. So if you have any questions or feedback —

  :title: 11 Things Developers Love Hearing From Non-Developer Co-Workers
  :content: <p>11 Things Developers Love Hearing From Non-Developer Co-Workers</p><h3>“The
    client needs this to work on IE 6.”</h3><p>In the workplace, non-developers see
    developers as folks who make magic out of code. As a developer, you could be building
    complex API integrations all day or just clicking around playing <a href="http://westofloathing.com/">West
    of Loathing</a> on Steam, and 99% of your coworkers wouldn’t be able to tell the
    difference. Even though tech companies literally couldn’t exist without their
    dev teams, devs are also somehow paid less than people with job titles like Chief
    Inspiration Ninja who sit in pointless meetings all day stealing credit for everyone
    else’s work.</p><p>If you’ve ever wanted to learn how to better communicate with
    your dev team, you should know that there are some things that devs LOVE hearing
    from non-developers. For example, developers *love *hearing how you “saved them
    some time” by making difficult and course-altering technical decisions without
    consulting them. Thanks so much for thinking of your dev team! I swear we’re NOT
    envisioning the days we’ll lose trying to save the company from a choice you made
    based on the fact that you knew a little bit of HTML from that one time you coded
    your MySpace page.</p><p>Here are some more things developers love hearing from
    their non-developer co-workers.</p><blockquote><h1><strong>“This change shouldn’t
    take more than a few minutes.”</strong></h1></blockquote><p>Thanks, marketing
    coordinator! I appreciate you telling me that this fix on the site won’t take
    long in spite of the fact that you have no idea that the website was built in
    COBOL that someone hacked together when you were five years old.</p><blockquote><h1><strong>“Let’s
    have a meeting!”</strong></h1></blockquote><p>Oh man, developers love nothing
    more than when non-developers ask them to have meetings… about everything! Have
    to make a decision on colors? Let’s have a meeting! Want to try to convince your
    team to build it in WordPress? Sounds like a great way to spend three hours I
    could also use to build that product that’s a month behind. We should schedule
    a meeting to figure out when we should have this meeting!</p><blockquote><h1><strong>“Don’t
    worry too much about security… it’s not like we’re going to get hacked or anything.”</strong></h1></blockquote><p>Thanks
    for your input, operations specialist! I’m sure it won’t affect you when someone
    hacks into our system and steals the records from every single person in our company.
    But since you know so much about security, I’ll defer to you to protect my salary
    information, social security number, payroll bank account information and my passwords.</p><blockquote><h1><strong>“There’s
    no requirements doc, but I’m sure you can figure it out.”</strong></h1></blockquote><p>I
    appreciate your faith in me! I’m sure I’ll be able to build this exactly the way
    the client wants on the first try and won’t have to endure a screaming match of
    who fucked it up when we try to push this through and it’s nothing like what the
    client needs.</p><blockquote><h1><strong>“I know I’m not a developer, but I think
    you should use this framework my cousin mentioned…”</strong></h1></blockquote><p>Thank
    you for your thoughts, guy who still sends personal email from his hotmail account!
    We SHOULD build in Ruby just because your cousin said it seemed cool after taking
    a two-hour General Assembly coding workshop three years ago.</p><blockquote><h1><strong>“I
    took the liberty of updating the codebase myself.”</strong></h1></blockquote><p>You
    saved me so much time! And, don’t stress yourself out over how much of that “saved”
    time time we eventually lost when the site crashed entirely and I had to spend
    the next two days putting it back together.</p><blockquote><h1><strong>“We don’t
    need your input because you’re not a creative.”</strong></h1></blockquote><p>That’s
    right, developers are NEVER creative! We don’t spend literally ALL DAY creating
    things and there’s NOTHING creative about seeing how we can make complicated systems
    work together. Let’s just keep the developers out of the creative process AND
    downplay their ideas when they finally do have a chance to voice them. And then
    let’s blame them when they tell us why all the tech we dreamed up without them
    was never feasible in the first place.</p><blockquote><h1><strong>“The client
    needs this to work on IE 6.”</strong></h1></blockquote><p>Super retro! I’ll go
    dig through a shed to try to find a computer I can actually test this on, for
    the four people who will ever actually try to access your site from a Windows
    2000 operating system.</p><blockquote><h1><strong>“We don’t want to pay for the
    software you need to license, so why don’t you just build it yourself?”</strong></h1></blockquote><p>Oh
    man, this’ll be so easy! I’m sure I can knock this out in two weeks. I mean, two
    months. Two years? Oh, fuck it, let’s just pay for the software that would have
    saved us $500,000 if we had licensed it two years ago.</p><blockquote><h1><strong>“I
    know you’ve been working on it for a year, but we’re canceling this project.”</strong></h1></blockquote><p>Yay!
    Thanks for freeing me up from all this time on the only project I was actually
    excited about at this company.</p><blockquote><h1><strong>“We’ve contracted you
    on this client project… you know ColdFusion, right?”</strong></h1></blockquote><p>Of
    course I do! Doesn’t everyone know this legacy system that was out with the George
    Bush era? I will gladly build your project in ColdFusion and try not to complain
    too hard when it shits itself and does literally nothing that more flexible codebases
    can do.</p><p>If you’ve ever said any of these things to your developers and they
    literally shoved their computers on the ground, shouted “WE’RE OUTTA HERE, YOU
    MANIAC!” and walked out the door while mooning you and the rest of the company,
    you can surmise that they were just SO EXCITED to get started! Or, maybe they’re
    just the kind of developers that would rather focus on making good work than getting
    stuck in bureaucratic nonsense. Whatever the case, just know that every time you
    say one of these things, you’re being a true friend to your development team.
    You know, just like Amber in accounting is to you when she incessantly explains
    to you exactly how you should do your job as the company’s sole Chief Inspiration
    Ninja.</p><h2>If you liked this piece, feel free to clap those hands at the bottom

  :title: This ‘Equity’ picture is actually White Supremacy at work
  :content: "<p>We’ve all seen this picture, right?</p><p>In a picture-is-worth-1,000-words
    kind of way, this image simplifies the profound difference between equality and
    equity. From this picture people have actually begun to understand that treating
    everyone <em>equally *doesn’t lead to *equity</em>, and in fact, equal treatment
    often perpetuates and justifies racial hierarchies. Yes, this picture has taught
    us a lot.</p><p>But, it’s time to move on.</p><p><strong>This picture —the noble
    imagery of the equity movement — is white supremacy at work.</strong></p><p>Sorry
    folks. But it’s true.</p><p>First and foremost, the shortest boy is positioned
    as the problem. He needs multiple boxes to see over the fence. He’s the one who
    is the pathology: <em>he’s literally less than the others</em>. The shortest boy
    is — by sheer presentation alone — not whole, not normal, especially compared
    to the tallest boy. And because he is shorter he is seen as the problem, he needs
    more help. He is by fact, needy.</p><p><strong>Dominant and oppressive narratives
    about people of color bleed into this picture: people of color are less than and
    thus, need more.</strong></p><p>This is white supremacy. This feeds into the oh-so-familiar
    racist politic — people of color have little to offer, and yet take so many public
    resources. Heard that before haven’t you?</p><p>Even those who “center equity”
    feed into this framework — people of color need our resources because they’re
    too broken to have their own. Volunteered with that organization maybe?</p><p>It
    is high time to rid ourselves of these white supremacy-laden “equity” ideas, and
    actually recognize the full humanity and capabilities of people of color.</p><p>Imagine
    if you will, 3 people —all the same goddamn size. The ground beneath them slopes,
    buckling beneath one person so significantly that person cannot see over the fence
    at all. The foundation on which these people stand is unequal, and that foundation,
    might we even say systemic, difference leads to some being able to watch the baseball
    game, while others cannot.</p><p>Yes, the person who is on the slope requires
    a box or two to stand on, but it is only because they are on lower ground to start
    — not because they are shorter to begin with.</p><p>As useful as the picture was
    in starting conversations around “Equality vs. Equity,” we are basically blaming
    the person for being short, when in reality, we aren’t standing on a level playing
    field to start. We aren’t <em>allowed</em> to stand on a level playing field.</p><p><strong>In
    fact, we are — by reason of policy, practice, prejudice, and bias — forced to
    stand on a lower level … AND then told we should be happy to be near the game
    at all. All while not given enough boxes to see over the fence.</strong></p><p>The
    unequal ground we are forced to stand on is the aspect of the picture we need
    to change. Understanding that those boxes are necessary because of the sloping
    ground is key to undoing white supremacy. With this new picture, let us decolonize
    the rules of where we stand and why.</p><p>That is equity.</p>"

  :title: Warren Buffett’s Recent Explanation of How Money Now Works Is the Most Important
    in History
  :content: '<p>The value of the money you have is changing. “Debt “and what it means
    is fundamentally changing.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2640/1*yTB0AML2PhCGh6iK5eDgbg.jpeg"
    alt="Image Credit:MarketWatch/Getty Images"><em>Image Credit:MarketWatch/Getty
    Images</em></p><p>Watching Warren Buffett completely change what he believes about
    money in a matter of months has been fascinating.</p><p>He is considered the most
    successful investor in history, so he’s worth listening to when financial markets
    enter a strange period that nobody understands or can properly explain (even if,
    like me, you don’t love everything he says).</p><p>These two lines <a href="https://twitter.com/GoldTelegraph_/status/1294779953246900225">from
    Warren</a> made me think:</p><p>“The [US] debt isn’t going to be repaid; it’s
    going to be refunded.”</p><p>“You better own something other than debt.”</p><p>Buffett
    explains that when the government can just keep on printing money to pay their
    own debt it’s laughable to think they will ever default. He says, “The trick [for
    countries] is to keep borrowing in your own currency.”</p><p>So if money will
    keep being printed out of thin air then what does that mean for your investments,
    assets and savings? Let’s explore the topic in simplistic terms and see what you
    can do about it.</p><h2>The Most Important Lesson On How Money Works From Warren
    Buffett</h2><p>This is <a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1294711729906212864">what
    Warren said recently</a> about how money works that will test everything you thought
    you knew about money:</p><blockquote><p>If the world turns into a world where
    you [governments] can issue more and more money and have negative interest rates
    over time — I’d have to see it to believe it, but I’ve seen a little bit of it.
    I’ve been surprised. I’ve been wrong so far.If you can have negative interest
    rates and pour out money, and incur more and more debt relative to productive
    capacity, you’d think the world would have discovered it in the first couple of
    thousand years rather than just coming on it now. We will see.It’s probably the
    most interesting question I’ve ever seen in economics.Can you keep doing what
    we’re doing now? The world has been able to do it for now a dozen years or so
    [since 2008]. We may be facing a period where we’re testing that hypothesis that
    you can continue it with a lot more force than we’ve tested it before.</p></blockquote><p>This
    description from Warren about all the free money we’ve all been getting access
    to because of a health crisis may explain why Warren has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/berkshire-adds-barrick-gold-exits-delta-air-lines-13f">sold
    a lot of his US bank stocks</a> recently.</p><p>The influential finance blog Zero
    Hedge <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/berkshire-adds-barrick-gold-exits-delta-air-lines-13f">wrote
    recently</a> that Warren “appears to now be quietly betting against the United
    States,” because “the famously anti-gold investor has abandoned banks — the backbone
    of America’s credit-driven economy — in favor of a gold miner.”</p><p>A friend
    said this to me the other day: “Watch what the billionaires do, not what they
    say.” If Warren’s actions are anything to go by then the record prices in the
    stock market are something to be very cautious of.</p><h2>Inflation Is Taking
    Hold</h2><p>Inflation is when prices go up and the value of your money decreases.
    Four dollars last year may have got you a small cup of coffee. That same cup of
    coffee might cost you $5 this year, as a simple example.</p><p>Inflation is a
    hidden tax on your money.</p><p>Warren says, “I’ve been wrong in thinking you
    could have the developments you’ve had without inflation taking hold.”</p><p>Warren
    has put his firm’s money in gold, and treasury bills which he describes as “a
    terrible investment over time.” (A treasury bill is an investment where you are
    essentially lending money to the government.)</p><p>So Warren is comfortable putting
    his money in terrible investments in the short-term because of what he can see
    in the world of finance. That decision is worth contemplating when thinking about
    your own money and investments.</p><h2>Why All of This Matters to You?</h2><p>We’ve
    talked a lot of finance shop in this article. Let’s break down why the change
    in how money now works matters to you.</p><h3>Negative interest rates</h3><p>Negative
    interest rates can be bad for you because it means you have to pay to store your
    money. It also means the bank you choose to bank with may face severe financial
    trouble that leads them to go out of business.</p><p>Yes, banks have insurance
    in case of such an event, but if the problem is too big then that deposit insurance
    is useless — many people do not understand this. They assume the government or
    a magic insurance policy will save them without any negative consequences.</p><p>We’re
    in uncharted territory and I would not be relying on anybody to come and save
    you and your money.</p><h3>The poor are being robbed by the rich who have the
    data to predict their moves.</h3><p>Many retail investors are buying stocks using
    apps like Robinhood — <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/robinhood-investors-charging-into-stock-investing-what-could-go-wrong/">the
    data tells us this trend.</a></p><p>While billionaires like Warren are exiting
    stocks and running to safety, everyday people seem to believe they are smarter
    than the pros — or the high-frequency, non-human trading bots who predict the
    moves of the retail investor and bet against them.</p><p>Investments firms use
    high-frequency trading to automate their investment decisions and beat the average
    investor. These same firms are front-running retail Robinhood investors. What
    does this mean in simple terms?</p><p>Sophisticated investment firms, <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/high-frequency-traders-really-love-doing-business-with-robinhood">according
    to Bloomberg</a>, are getting access to data that tells them what the retail investors
    (<em>dumb money</em> as it’s known in finance) are doing so they can take advantage
    of them.</p><p>This data allows investment firms to rob the poor and pay the rich
    — the name of the Robinhood app is kind of ironic, isn’t it?</p><h3>The stock
    market bubble</h3><p>Record unemployment. A global health crisis. Protests. Despite
    the world we live in stock markets are <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/08/19/stock-market-record-economy-recession-coronavirus-pandemic-recovery/3345090001/">beating
    record highs</a>. Crazy, or a disaster waiting to happen?</p><p>Another iconic
    billionaire investor, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/george-soros-bashes-president-trump-explains-why-he-no-longer-participates-in-this-market-bubble-2020-08-12">George
    Soros</a>, called the stock market a bubble. “<em>Investors are in a bubble fueled
    by Fed liquidity,” *he says and that’s why he “</em>no longer participates*.”</p><p>Either
    everything is fine with markets and businesses haven’t been affected by the health
    crisis at all, or we’re watching a bubble that’s about to pop. I don’t have the
    answer so that’s why I’m sitting on the sidelines.</p><h3>The change in the velocity
    of money</h3><p>While free money is being given away through economic stimulus
    and large amounts of money are being printed out of thin air, the velocity of
    money is down. (The velocity of money just means how many times one dollar passes
    through multiple people’s hands.)</p><p>When large amounts of money are created
    out of thin air and that currency is not spent, when that money eventually is
    spent, it can lead to larger than normal amounts of inflation that devalue the
    money you’ve worked hard for.</p><p>Example of decrease in the velocity of money:</p><p><img

    velocity of money is right down. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis"><em>The
    velocity of money is right down. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</em></p><p>Example
    of the extra money being printed out of thin air:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4658/1*wyna4u2Rw0K9V13mBBI5vQ.jpeg"
    alt="The increase in money creation has exploded. Source: Board of Governors of
    the Federal Reserve System (US)"><em>The increase in money creation has exploded.
    Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US)</em></p><h2>Takeaway</h2><p>The
    way money works and functions in society has fundamentally changed. It has got
    some of the greatest investment minds like Warren Buffett and George Soros challenged,
    too. They have run to safety as a result.</p><p>What you can do about the change
    in how money works is this: be cautious in the short-term with your money and
    investing in assets.</p><p>The other critical learning you can take away from
    Warren is to spend some time understanding these financial concepts via a website
    like Investopedia:</p><ul><li><p>Money Printing</p></li><li><p>M1 and M2 money
    supply</p></li><li><p>The Velocity of Money</p></li><li><p>Stock market bubbles
    (Tech Stocks Bubble in 2000)</p></li><li><p>Inflation vs. Deflation</p></li><li><p>Bailouts
    vs. Bail-ins — in the event of a financial crisis</p></li></ul><p>If you understand
    these basics of how money works you can protect yourself and everything you’ve
    worked for. Now is not a time to panic. Now is a time to learn and prosper from
    what is transpiring in the global economy.</p><p>The value of the money you have
    is changing. The word <em>debt</em> and what it means is changing. Watch what
    the billionaire investors are doing because they tell you a lot of what you need
    to know.</p><p>You decide whether you donate your money to a trading app, watch
    it devalue because of inflation, or invest with a big safety net and act like
    a pro.</p><p><em>This article is for informational purposes only, it should not

  :title: How to Work 40 Hours in 16.7 (The Simple Technique That Gave Me My Life
    Back)
  :content: '<p><em>I used to work *</em>a lot** — 60, 80, or even 100 hours a week…*</p><p>I
    let my work be a big part of how I defined myself. I wore those insane hours like
    a badge of honor…I loved telling people how <em>“busy”</em> I was…and how much
    I <em>“had to do”</em>.</p><p>Sound familiar?</p><p>Looking back, I realize I
    used my work to try and fill a void in myself. The problem was that this void
    was like a black hole. <strong>No matter how many <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/optimal-work-time-how-long-should-we-work-every-day-the-science-of-mental-strength">hours
    I worked</a>, it never seemed to fill it up.</strong> If anything, it made me
    feel worse.</p><p>One day I’d had enough. Truth be told, I’d had way more than
    enough. I stopped and reevaluated my life, trying to figure out what was important
    to me, and what wasn’t.</p><p>I had to make a big change. I had to figure out
    how to <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/5-ways-to-get-more-done-by-working-smarter-not-harder">work
    smarter, not harder</a>. I needed to optimize my work process to <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/5-more-ways-to-work-smarter-not-harder">do
    more in less time</a>.</p><p>I needed the Pomodoro Technique. Here’s how this
    incredible simple time management system changed my workday — and ultimately,
    my life. I think it can do the same for you.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/0*zG2fdqf5MSNbKZwW.jpg"
    alt=""></p><h2>What is the Pomodoro?</h2><p>Over the years I‘d heard about a time
    management system called the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro
    Technique</a>. It seemed too simple, but as they say, the simplest things often
    work best.</p><p>I read <a href="http://caps.ucsd.edu/Downloads/tx_forms/koch/pomodoro_handouts/ThePomodoroTechnique_v1-3.pdf">the
    2006 paper</a> written by its creator, Francesco Cirilio, which explained the
    technique and as importantly, the psychology behind it. This revolutionary time
    management system is deceptively simple to learn, but life-changing when applied
    correctly. <a href="http://blog.trello.com/how-to-pomodoro-your-way-to-productivity/">The
    Pomodoro Technique</a> can be broken down into the following four basic principles.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*adonwLyg3ZhPlyX2.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>1.
    Work with time, not against it:</strong> Many of us live as if time is our enemy.We
    race the clock to finish assignments and meet deadlines. The Pomodoro Technique
    teaches us to work with time, instead of struggling against it.</p><p><strong>2.
    Eliminate burnout:</strong> Taking <a href="https://open.buffer.com/science-taking-breaks-at-work/">short,
    scheduled breaks</a> while working eliminates the “running on fumes” feeling you
    get when you push yourself too hard. It’s impossible to overwork when you stick
    to the system.</p><p><strong>3. Manage distractions:</strong> Phone calls, emails,
    Facebook messages, or suddenly realizing you need to change the oil in your car
    — <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/what-multitasking-does-to-our-brains">distractions
    constantly bombard us</a>. Usually, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/changing-your-phone-settings-could-improve-your-productivity-2015-7">these
    distractions can wait</a>. The Pomodoro Technique helps you log your distractions…and
    prioritize them for later.</p><p><strong>4. Create a better work/life balance:</strong>
    Most of us are far too intimately acquainted with the guilt that comes from <a
    href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating-by-using-the-2-minute-rule">procrastination</a>.
    If we haven’t had a productive day, we can’t seem to enjoy our free time. As a
    Pomodoro master, you create an effective timetable and achieve your high-priority
    tasks, so you truly enjoy your time off.</p><h2>The Pomodoro process: 25 minutes
    of focus</h2><p>Right now you’re probably thinking: <em>“This all sounds great,
    but what the heck do I actually do?”</em></p><h3>It’s actually quite simple…</h3><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*m5bYWyazJuv_OBeD.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Right
    now, you’re probably thinking* “Twenty five minutes of work? That’s nothing! This
    is gonna be easy!”*</p><p>Not so fast…</p><p>That’s** 25 minutes of steady, <a
    href="https://open.buffer.com/single-tasking/">focused work on ONE task</a>.**
    No multitasking. No <a href="https://open.buffer.com/send-better-email/">emails</a>.
    No <a href="https://open.buffer.com/zero-notifications/">phone calls</a>. No <a
    href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/psychology-of-facebook">checking Facebook</a>.
    <strong>Nothing!</strong> No distractions allowed.</p><h2>Get started: Here are
    the tools you need</h2><p>For me, this took some getting used to, and required
    some tools and hacks. Here’s what I used:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*JALqvD07tfOccqdb.jpg"
    alt=""></p><h2>My first tries with Pomodoro: “Ugh.”</h2><p>Like most things in
    my life, I learned through experimentation, experiencing a lot of pain and frustration
    but ultimately growth.</p><p>At first, I thought I could do 16 Pomodoros each
    day…no problem. I was used to working so much, that less than seven hours of work
    seemed like a breeze!</p><p>The first day I completed 12 Pomodoros. I got a ton
    done, but still felt like a failure because I fell short of my goal. I felt tired…and
    miserable.</p><p>Ugh…</p><p>Over the following days, I tried cutting back on my
    target number. When it worked, I got a ton of stuff done and felt amazingly productive.
    I knew I was onto something good. Other days, I did too little or too much and
    I felt like crap…and I was convinced this was the dumbest system in the world.</p><p>Double
    ugh.</p><p>One day, I just ignored the system altogether and went back to multitasking.
    <strong>I was unfocused, unproductive, and frustrated.</strong> I gritted my teeth
    and kept doing things my old way for a few more days. What I found was that I
    got things done, but my productivity simply couldn’t compare to when it all clicked
    with the Pomodoros.</p><p>Triple ugh.</p><h2>Finding my balance: The magic of
    “8”</h2><p>Eventually my sanity returned. I began experimenting with smaller numbers
    of Pomodoros, starting with five per day and gradually working my way up to eight.
    My goal was eight Pomodoros each weekday, for a total of 40 per week.</p><p>This
    worked (<em>sort of</em>) but as they say, life happens. Some days I had so many
    meetings to attend, or my daughter had a recital at school which I didn’t want
    to miss, and I just couldn’t find fit in eight Pomodoros.</p><p>It was clear to
    me that 40 was my magic weekly number…but I needed to be less rigid with how I
    approached my work-week.</p><p><em>The math was straightforward:</em></p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*wi-Y_lGYD0ww3AQA.jpg" alt=""></p><p>However,
    when I had too much going on, or felt physically or mentally off, I couldn’t fit
    in eight Pomodoros. I’d fall behind, and next day I’d try to cram in 14, leaving
    me exhausted and not very happy with the quality of my work.</p><p>I realized
    I had to step back and rethink my week, paying attention to my moods. To refocus
    on <a href="https://hitenism.com/focus-on-your-own-success/">what was right</a>
    for me. The Pomodoro Technique was great, but something was missing to make it
    really work for me.</p><h2>How I learned to love the 7-day workweek (really!)</h2><p>When
    I decided to change, I swore to myself I’d never work on weekends, holidays, vacations,
    or even after 5 PM. Great, right? Well, I’m happy to report I’ve broken all of
    these promises…<em>and that’s actually a good thing.</em></p><p>On those days
    when I couldn’t finish eight Pomodoros by 5 PM, I’d feel stressed. I’d feel like
    a failure. Suddenly I realized my view of the work week was too limiting. Why
    did I make those commitments to myself, limiting when I could work? I did it because
    I was coming from an unfulfilling work life, working too many hours, and for the
    wrong reasons.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*xVMMDke2haMV7SyG.jpg"
    alt=""></p><p>I transitioned from just <em>working</em>…to <strong>working on
    things that fulfilled me</strong>.What’s more, I gave myself the freedom to do
    non-work stuff, such as attending my daughter’s recital during what most people
    consider work hours. This made it easy to shift my mindset about when I could
    or couldn’t work.</p><p>The final piece to my puzzle was moving from a five-day
    work-week, where I had to stop by 5 PM, to a <a href="https://open.buffer.com/7-day-work-week-experiment-wisdom-day-rest/">seven-day
    work-week</a>, where I could work when it suited me. This took me from 40–45 hours
    available to get my 40 Pomodoros in, to having 168 hours each week. Since I only
    need <strong>16.7 hours net</strong>, that means <strong>I only work 10% of my
    time</strong>. What a difference!</p><h2>Everything in just 16.7 hours a week?!</h2><p>Right
    now you’re probably thinking, <em>“I work more than that in two days! And you’re
    trying to tell me that’s all I need to work in an entire week?”</em></p><p>YES!
    That’s exactly what I’m telling you. And NO, you’ll probably still ‘work’ more
    than 16.7 hours a week. Let me explain…</p><p>I <em>‘work’</em> 35–40 hours a
    week, but I spend at least 20–25 of those hours on calls, meetings, networking
    on- and offline, and other less-focused tasks. These are important, but <em>I
    don’t count them as ‘work’ time.</em></p><p>I truly <strong>work</strong> 16.7
    hours each week…and I get about five times more accomplished in those few hours
    than in the other 25 hours.</p><p>There’s no avoiding it. <a href="http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2010/03/08/how-to-deal-with-life-when-sh-happens/">Life
    happens.</a> As long as humans are involved, and especially if you live in modern
    society with its 24/7 connectedness, it’s next to impossible to have a perfect
    working environment. However, you can work smarter without having to work harder.</p><h2>The
    psychology of motivation: Mastering your energy</h2><p>In a perfect world, I’d
    have eight high-value tasks identified at the start of each workday. I’d prioritize
    these, and knock them off one by one, from most important to least. I’d be equally
    enthusiastic and motivated about each one, wouldn’t be interrupted, and would
    finish my day’s work in less than three hours.</p><p>Sounds great, right? Unfortunately,
    “we live nowhere near perfect”.</p><p>The reality is that I’m a human being, living
    in a world full of other humans. I have emotions I don’t control, and I often
    get tired. Some tasks I simply don’t feel like doing, even though I know they’re
    important — possibly even urgent.</p><p>To make this work long-term, I had to
    face these things and learn to work with, rather than against them.</p><p>My energy
    level and attitude affect my work and output, so I had to stay present to how
    I was feeling, and master myself. <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/the-4-elements-of-physical-energy-on-how-to-master-them">This
    post on mastering one’s energy</a> made it all click. I found these questions
    especially helpful:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*IGMmA54-mDxT59Il.jpg"
    alt=""></p><p>These questions helped me take into account my mood and energy when
    prioritizing tasks. As a result, I no longer do anything just because I feel I
    have to.</p><p>When my physical energy is low, I work on my health and wellness.When
    my emotional energy is low, I find something that makes me happy, like spending
    time with my wife and daughter.</p><p>Of course, I also had to find work I enjoyed,
    that fulfilled me…rather than work that drained me. By doing this, I have more
    time to improve myself, be with friends and family, and truly be healthy on all
    levels — <a href="https://open.buffer.com/daily-success-routine/">**mind, body,
    and soul</a>**.</p><h2>Want to go further?</h2><p><strong>Slowly but surely, Pomodoro
    has forever change how I work…</strong></p><p>Are you up for it?</p><p><strong>Action
    Idea:</strong> Why not try one Pomodoro today? Twenty-five minutes of concentrated
    work on one task. Start with one and work up from there.</p><p>And if you want
    to go further, I want to make it as easy as possible for you.</p><p><a href="http://www.chriswinfield.com/save-23-hour-bonus-page">**Click

    I spoke to an ambitious group of high school students at <a href="http://sparc-camp.org/">SPARC</a>
    in Berkeley. Several of them asked me about things I wish I had done or learned
    earlier in life, or regrets I had from earlier in my career. Again and again,
    I came back to the idea that I wish I had* lived my life *differently.</p><p><img

    human."><em>2006 was one of the best years for Facebook, and one of the worst
    years for me as a human.</em></p><p>I wish I had slept more hours, and exercised
    regularly. I wish I had made better decisions about what to eat or drink — at
    times I consumed more soda and energy drinks than water. I wish I had made more
    time for <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/radical-inclusion-vs-radical-self-reliance-at-burning-man-b6ab7a2a8321">other
    experiences</a> that helped me grow incredibly quickly once I gave them a chance.</p><p>You
    might think: but if you had prioritized those things, wouldn’t your contributions
    have been reduced? Would Facebook have been less successful?</p><p>Actually, I
    believe I would have been <em>more</em> effective: a better leader and a more
    focused employee. I would have had fewer panic attacks, and acute health problems
    — like throwing out my back regularly in my early 20s. I would have picked fewer
    petty fights with my peers in the organization, because I would have been generally
    more centered and self-reflective. I would have been less frustrated and resentful
    when things went wrong, and required me to put in even more hours to deal with
    a local crisis. In short, I would have had more energy and spent it in smarter
    ways… AND I would have been happier. That’s why this is a true regret for me:
    I don’t feel like I chose between two worthy outcomes. No, I made a foolish sacrifice
    on both sides.</p><p>This week, the tech industry has been passionately debating
    a recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html">New
    York Times article about Amazon’s intense work culture</a>. Many found the article
    one-sided, using dramatic anecdotes to caricature a culture built around passion
    and intensity, while some insiders have <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/amazonians-response-inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-nick-ciubotariu">risen
    to publicly defend the company</a>. However, as far as I can tell, most people
    do not contest that the culture *is *intense and people *do *work really hard
    at Amazon. Fundamentally, this is a familiar part of tech culture: at high performing
    companies, employees work extremely hard, to an extent that is unsustainable for
    most people.</p><p>But it doesn’t have to be this way.</p><blockquote><h1>Many
    people believe that weekends and the 40-hour workweek are some sort of great compromise
    between capitalism and hedonism, but that’s not historically accurate.</h1></blockquote><p>Many
    people believe that weekends and the 40-hour workweek are some sort of great compromise
    between capitalism and hedonism, but that’s not historically accurate. They are
    actually the carefully considered outcome of <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ford-factory-workers-get-40-hour-week">profit-maximizing
    research by Henry Ford</a> in the early part of the 20th century. He discovered
    that you could actually get more output out of people by having them work fewer
    days and fewer hours. Since then, other researchers have <a href="http://ericdodds.com/research-and-the-realities-of-time-worked/">continued
    to study this phenomenon</a>, including in more modern industries like game development.</p><p>The
    research is clear: beyond ~40–50 hours per week, the marginal returns from additional
    work decrease rapidly and quickly become negative. We have also demonstrated that
    though you can get more output for a few weeks during “crunch time” you still
    ultimately pay for it later when people inevitably need to recover. If you try
    to sustain crunch time for longer than that, you are merely creating the illusion
    of increased velocity. This is true at multiple levels of abstraction: the hours
    worked per week, <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3035605/how-to-be-a-success-at-everything/the-exact-amount-of-time-you-should-work-every-day">the

    nothing in return.</h1></blockquote><p>So it is with deep sadness that I observe
    the current culture of intensity in the tech industry. My intellectual conclusion
    is that these companies are both destroying the personal lives of their employees
    and getting nothing in return. A candidate recently deciding between Asana and
    another fast growing company told me that the other team starts their dinners
    at 830pm to encourage people to stay late (he’s starting here in a few weeks).
    I also hear young developers frequently brag about “48 hour” coding sprints. This
    kind of attitude not only hurts young workers who are willing to “step up” to
    the expectation, but <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/silicon-valleys-youth-problem.html">facilitates
    ageism and sexism</a> by indirectly discriminating against people who cannot maintain
    that kind of schedule.</p><p>Why are companies doing this? It must be some combination
    of 1/ not knowing the research 2/ believing the research is somehow flawed or
    doesn’t apply to them (they’re wrong) or 3/ understanding that many people see
    these cultural artifacts as a signal about the intensity and passion of the team.
    I believe it is a combination of all three factors, and the third one resonates
    particularly strongly with me. We’ve worked hard to build a culture at Asana where
    people don’t work *too *hard, but we sometimes have candidates tell us they are
    worried that means we don’t move fast enough, or have enough urgency. I’m not
    sure what I would do if I thought these values were actually in conflict, but
    fortunately they are not. We get to encourage a healthy work-life balance in the
    cold, hard pursuit of profit. We are maximizing our velocity and our happiness
    at the same time.</p><p>As an industry, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/20/do-great-things/">we
    are falling short of our potential</a>. We could be accomplishing more, and we
    could be providing a better life for all of the people who work in technology.
    If you’re going to devote the best years of your life to work, do so intentionally.
    You can do great things AND live your life well. You <em>can</em> have it all,
    and science says you should.</p><p><em>Note: I’ve written this from the perspective
    of the tech industry, since that’s my perspective, but the pattern definitely
    exists prominently in other industries, and in companies across all industries.</em></p>'

  :title: How does blockchain really work? I built an app to show you.
  :content: "<p>According to Wikipedia, a blockchain is:</p><blockquote><h1>A distributed
    database that is used to maintain a continuously growing list of records, called
    <em>blocks</em>.</h1></blockquote><p>That sounds nice, but how does it work?</p><p>To
    illustrate a blockchain, we will use an open source command-line interface called
    <a href=\"https://github.com/seanseany/blockchain-cli\">Blockchain CLI</a>.</p><p>I
    also built a <a href=\"http://blockchaindemo.io/\">browser-based version of this
    here</a>.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*cdVD7nxyDPb35phEisVXww.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><h2>Installing the Command-Line Interface version</h2><p>If you haven’t
    already, install <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/download/\">Node.js</a>.</p><p>Then
    run the following in your terminal:</p><pre><code># Clone this repository$ git
    clone https://github.com/seanseany/blockchain-cli# Go into the repository$ cd
    blockchain-cli# Install dependencies$ npm install# Run the app$ npm start</code></pre><p>You
    should see \U0001F44B Welcome to Blockchain CLI!and a blockchain → prompt ready
    to take commands.</p><h2>What does a block look like?</h2><p>To see your current
    blockchain, enter blockchain or bc into the command prompt. You should see a block
    like the image below.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Y3c_hIqCuiDH4x-8dObVyg.png\"
    alt=\"A block on the blockchain\"><em>A block on the blockchain</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Index
    (Block #):</strong> Which block is it? (Genesis block has index 0)</p></li><li><p><strong>Hash:</strong>
    Is the block valid?</p></li><li><p>*<em>Previous Hash: *</em>Is the previous block
    valid?</p></li><li><p>*<em>Timestamp: *</em>When was the block added?</p></li><li><p>*<em>Data:
    *</em>What information is stored on the block?</p></li><li><p>*<em>Nonce: *</em>How
    many iterations did we go through before we found a valid block?</p></li></ul><h3>Genesis
    Block</h3><p>Every blockchain will start with the\U0001F3C6 Genesis Block. As
    you will see later, each block on the blockchain is dependent on the previous
    block. So, the Genesis block is needed to mine our first block.</p><h2>What happens
    when a new block is mined?</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*SmJPc37pUbFySCvUdxnQxA.gif\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Let’s mine our first block. Enter mine freeCodeCamp♥︎ into the
    prompt.</p><p>The blockchain looks at the latest block on the blockchain for the
    index and previous hash. In this case Genesis block is the latest block.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Index:</strong>
    o+1 = 1</p></li><li><p>*<em>Previous Hash: *</em>0000018035a828da0…</p></li><li><p>*<em>Timestamp:

    ??</p></li><li><p><strong>Nonce:</strong> ??</p></li></ul><h2>How is the hash
    calculated?</h2><p>A <strong>hash value</strong> is a numeric <strong>value</strong>
    of a fixed length that uniquely identifies data.</p><p>The hash is calculated
    by taking the index, previous block hash, timestamp, block data, and nonce as
    input.</p><pre><code>CryptoJS.SHA256(index + previousHash + timestamp + data +
    nonce)</code></pre><p>The SHA256 algorithm will calculate a unique hash, given
    those inputs. The same inputs will always return the same hash.</p><h3>Did you
    notice the four leading 0’s in the block hash?</h3><p>The four leading 0’s is
    a minimum requirement for a valid hash. The number of leading 0’s required is
    called <strong>difficulty</strong>.</p><pre><code>function isValidHashDifficulty(hash,
    difficulty) {  for (var i = 0, b = hash.length; i &lt; b; i ++) {      if (hash[i]
    !== &#39;0&#39;) {          break;      }  }  return i &gt;= difficulty;}</code></pre><p>This
    is also known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system\">Proof-of-Work
    system</a>.</p><h2>What’s a nonce?</h2><p>A nonce is a number used to find a valid
    hash.</p><pre><code>let nonce = 0;let hash;let input;while(!isValidHashDifficulty(hash))
    {       nonce = nonce + 1;  input = index + previousHash + timestamp + data +
    nonce;  hash = CryptoJS.SHA256(input)}</code></pre><p>The nonce iterates until
    the hash is valid. In our case, a valid hash has at least four leading 0’s. The
    process of finding a nonce that corresponds to a valid hash is <strong>mining</strong>.</p><p>As
    the difficulty <strong>increases</strong>, the number of possible valid hashes
    <strong>decreases</strong><em>.</em> With less possible valid hashes, it takes
    more processing power to find a valid hash.</p><h2>Why does this matter?</h2><p>It
    matters because it keeps the blockchain immutable.</p><p>If we have the following
    blockchain A → B → C, and someone wants to change data on Block A. This is what
    happens:</p><ol><li><p>Data changes on Block A.</p></li><li><p>Block A’s hash
    changes because data is used to calculate the hash.</p></li><li><p>Block A becomes
    invalid because its hash no longer has four leading 0’s.</p></li><li><p>Block
    B’s hash changes because Block A’s hash was used to calculate Block B’s hash.</p></li><li><p>Block
    B becomes invalid because its hash no longer has four leading 0&#39;s.</p></li><li><p>Block
    C’s hash changes because Block B’s hash was used to calculate Block C’s hash.</p></li><li><p>Block
    C becomes invalid because its hash no longer has four leading 0&#39;s.</p></li></ol><p>The
    only way to mutate a block would be to mine the block again, and all the blocks
    after. Since new blocks are always being added, it’s nearly impossible to mutate
    the blockchain.</p><p>I hope this tutorial was helpful for you!</p><p>If you would

  :title: How to Make Your Subconscious Mind Work for You
  :content: '<p>So creative, it seems like magic: a step-by-step guide to unleashing
    your most innovative brainpower</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*e2Odga58h5KRsrZD4M-YpA.jpeg"
    alt="Image by [TeroVesalainen](https://pixabay.com/en/users/TeroVesalainen-809550/)
    on Pixabay"><em>Image by <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/users/TeroVesalainen-809550/">TeroVesalainen</a>
    on Pixabay</em></p><p>Our rational, conscious mind is a wonderful thing. But sometimes
    when we are looking for a solution, it can be a limited resource. I’m always looking
    for ways to work <strong>smarter</strong>, not harder.</p><p>What if I could come
    up with answers in my sleep? I discovered that it’s possible to do just that.</p><p>To
    the outsider, it can look as if someone were literally dreaming up solutions to
    situations. What’s really happening, though, is that a person who is skilled at
    this is first removing their overeager <em>conscious</em> mind temporarily from
    the equation, and then mobilizing the power of their <em>subconscious</em> minds
    through the power of a specific question.</p><p>It’s not half as complicated as
    that last sentence suggests. Questions are the key. I learned how to make this
    work for me, and I’ll show you how to do it, too.</p><h2>How Does It Work?</h2><p>To
    understand better how the mind works, we’re going to look at an analogy from science
    fiction: the Starship Enterprise from Star Trek—partly for its shape, and partly
    for the the way the different departments interact.</p><p>The “bridge” of the
    ship is the place where most of the action appears to happen—it’s the control
    center. Captain Kirk stands manfully on the bridge of the Enterprise, making decisions
    and giving orders—with an ego the size of a nearby planet.</p><p>Captain Kirk
    is, in fact, the perfect example of ‘ego’ from the point of view of psychology
    or personal development: he’s our self concept or the representation of the constructed
    self.</p><p><a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ego">The Oxford
    dictionary defines ego as</a> “<em>the part of the mind that mediates between
    the conscious and the unconscious and is responsible for reality testing and a
    sense of personal identity.”</em></p><p>Despite what he gets up to in the series,
    Captain Kirk’s job is to ensure the success of his mission and the continual wellbeing
    of his crew and ship. It is up to him to receive and evaluate information, weigh
    options, and decide on the best course of action.</p><p>Our conscious brain work
    is like our own ‘Captain Kirk’, standing on the bridge of our mind, taking control
    and trying to make all the decisions. Any problems or situations to be reviewed
    come here first to the bridge, and our conscious mind is very good at making those
    decisions.</p><p>However, like Captain Kirk, our ego can be a little too full
    of its own importance and overeagerness to solve issues. It often doesn’t notice
    all the possible solutions, or make use of resources better suited to finding
    those solutions.</p><p>The bridge is only a small part of <em>The Enterprise</em>,
    however. Supporting everything happening on the bridge is engineering. The bridge
    and Captain Kirk may look like the center, but without engineering, no one’s going
    anywhere. Engineering is where the warp engines lay, and where all the data is
    stored from every mission and available databank.</p><p>The *<em>WILL *</em>to
    boldly go may be on the bridge of the ship, but the *<em>POWER *</em>to get there
    is in the engineering bay.</p><p>The engines and the supercomputers in engineering
    never stop, never sleep—unlike Captain Kirk. They receive instructions, then keep
    processing and working away until a solution is found.</p><p>In <em>The Enterprise</em>
    of our mind, the engineering bay is our subconscious mind. Always processing,
    it doesn’t sleep like the conscious mind.</p><h2>The Problem-Solving Power of
    the Subconscious Mind</h2><p>Max Maltz likens the subconscious mind to a supercomputer
    or autoserver mechanism in his work (and subsequent book), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Psycho-Cybernetics-Updated-Expanded-Maxwell-Maltz/dp/0399176136/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=5D4K7B0BSSJK0B2M3G16">Psycho
    Cybernetics.</a> Maltz originally published this back in 1960, but his methods
    and ideas are still prevalent, and relevant, today. You can see the influence
    of his work in that of thought leaders such as Zig Ziglar, Tony Robbins, and <a
    href="undefined">Benjamin P. Hardy</a>.</p><p>He explains that in the same way
    that a machine does not reason or judge, rather it just follows the task set it,
    so does the subconscious mind.</p><p>A really simple example of this is when you’re
    trying to remember someone’s name. It bugs us, doesn’t it? The simple question
    of “what is their name?” is sent back from the conscious to the subconscious mind,
    where our search engine works away until three hours later, while washing up,
    we think “Jane!”</p><p>The original situation has passed, but the subconscious
    “engineering” has been working away to find an answer while our conscious mind
    has been doing other things. Now while we’re doing something that doesn’t involve
    high levels of brain power, the message can get through, “Hey, you on the bridge:
    Jane!”</p><p>Another example of the play between conscious and subconscious is
    how they work together when we need to make a decision. For example, let’s say
    I want to buy new shoes.</p><p>As I go about my daily tasks, I now start noticing
    people’s shoes. The file is still open on ‘Which shoes do I buy?’ so my data collection
    devices (eyes and ears) send information back into the control center (conscious
    mind) which does a quick evaluation (horrible color/looks comfy).</p><p>Did I
    notice people’s shoes before? Not really.</p><p>Were people wearing shoes before
    that? Of course! I just didn’t have a “scan and search” order set for “shoes”.</p><p>Buying
    shoes is a simple example, but the same principle is in action if we want to change
    our job, find a course, meet a new partner, or discover a way to change an area
    of our lives. We can set an order to search and scan. The data comes in, and the
    amazingly powerful subconscious connects and compiles it, even when we are not
    <em>consciously</em> thinking about it.</p><h2>How to Get It to Work for You</h2><p>We
    know that asking the right questions are the key, and that we need to get the
    Captain Kirk of our ego to release its hold on the situation and take a break.</p><p>So
    now we can look at how to practically do that and set up our brains for finding
    creative solutions and success.</p><p><strong>Questions are the key. **A</strong>
    *<em>question is better than an opinion or affirmation for finding creative solutions.
    Positive affirmations can be very effective for changing the programing in our
    subconscious, but it doesn’t send the command to *do</em> anything: to search
    and connect.</p><p>I’ve been consistently working on this idea of setting my subconscious
    a question for nearly a year and I have noticed differences in my results. Here
    is what I’ve learned, through trial and error, and some corresponding research.</p><h3>Ask
    quality questions</h3><p>Good questions invite action and expansion. The subconscious
    loves making connections and having something to do, and it loves <em>good</em>
    questions.</p><p>Secondly, the focus of the question makes a difference. A big
    difference.</p><p>If I send the question ‘how can I feel less tired all the time?’
    it’s a negative question. The focus is on feeling tired, so that’s what you are
    telling your computer to focus on. The resulting thoughts and feelings will reflect
    this focus. ‘Tired’ in, ‘tired’ out.</p><p>By rephrasing the question to: ‘How
    can I re-energize myself this week?’ the focus is positive, on energy and feeling
    energized, and the results will follow suit. By setting a specific time frame
    of this week or tomorrow, you are also setting nice manageable parameters for
    your subconscious to play with.</p><p>I found that it was worth spending a little
    time phrasing my questions so they were positive and specific. The five or ten
    minutes I spent weighing the question until it felt right and in line with what
    I wanted was worth it in results.</p><h3>Get your ego to let go</h3><p>When we
    hold on to our issues in our conscious mind, it can cause stress and frustration.
    It’s not surprising really: it needs options and space with which to consider
    decisions or have that insight.</p><p>Essentially, you need to take a break! It
    might sounds surprising to say that to find the solution, you should stop consciously
    working on it. Remember: Archimedes didn’t have his ‘Eureka’ moment until he had
    his bath.</p><p>Sherlock Holmes, although a fictional character, would play chess
    or the violin when wanting the answer to something that had him stumped. I wonder
    how many times Arthur Conan Doyle did something similar as he allowed his mind
    to percolate his stories and ideas?</p><p>Personally, I find taking a break allows
    me release the build up of pressure in my thoughts, meaning that the only headbanging
    that I do is to music.</p><p><strong>Take a break to be more productive.</strong></p><p>It
    is an effective short term solution. It gives ‘engineering’ time to sort through
    data and make connections, send the results back up to the bridge and … ‘Eureka!’</p><h3>Nap
    to release the ego</h3><p>Thomas Edison would regularly take a nap when faced
    with a problem. He is famous for taking a nap in his chair while holding two metal
    balls in his hands, which would drop and wake him if he fell into a deep sleep.
    The answer or insight would often be there upon waking.</p><p>Albert Einstein
    and Nikola Tesla were also famous for their napping habits.</p><p>Did you know
    that famous British prime minister Winston Churchill had a bed in the Houses of
    Parliament, and was convinced that his regular siestas and power naps were part
    of the success of his governing?</p><p>I used to laugh at the idea of a power
    nap—they’re for grannies, right? But I found I was wrong and that sometimes a
    brief bit of downtime refreshes my energy levels, and allows my subconscious mind
    to shine. The subconscious doesn’t sleep, remember, so a brief bit of shut eye
    effectively releases my conscious mind’s hold on a subject so that ‘engineering’
    can do what it does best.</p><h3>Sleep, perchance to dream…</h3><p>Napping is
    good, but what I find to be most effective is to ask a question at night, right
    before sleeping.</p><p>In bed, nice and relaxed, I like to review my day and send
    a question to my subconscious to play with while I recharge my batteries.</p><p><strong>I’m
    literally working in my sleep.</strong></p><p>One <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605564/">article
    on neural plasticity</a> published in the ‘Frontiers in Neural Circuits’ journal
    explains that —</p><blockquote><h1>“<em>During sleep, new synaptic connections
    are formed, and old connections are ‘cleaned up’. This can allow you to see patterns
    where none existed before.”</em></h1></blockquote><p>Edison is said to never have
    gone to sleep without first setting his mind a question. Those patterns mentioned
    in the article are what give us the solutions and insights the next morning.</p><h3>Write
    your pre-sleep question down</h3><p>Writing the question down before sleep helps
    me twofold.</p><p>It helps me to think about, and carefully form, the best question
    to give me the best answer. It also reminds me in the morning what I’d asked.</p><p>Writing
    it down at night to review the next day keeps me on track.</p><p>This has become
    a part of my nightly routine—a sort of mental hygiene. In the same way that I
    brush my teeth at night as part of my dental health, I also review my three wins
    and set my question in my journal as part of my mental health.</p><h3>Journal
    in the morning</h3><p>The technique of setting your question at night before sleep
    works really well in conjunction with morning journaling.</p><p>I’m not talking
    about the ‘what I had for breakfast and my back aches’ type of journaling, but
    rather a form of writing where we move ourselves into a peak state of focus and
    set our most valuable priorities for our day, sculpting our future before it happens.</p><p>Some
    use the habit of ‘<a href="https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/">morning
    pages</a>’, where they brain-dump, first thing in the morning, as they write without
    specifically filtering ideas. Nedd Herrmann in his <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-function-of-t-1997-12-22/">work
    on brain waves</a> confirmed that there is something special about capturing your
    mental state upon first waking:</p><p><em>“During this awakening cycle it is possible
    for individuals to stay in the theta state for an extended period of say, five
    to 15 minutes — which would allow them to have a free flow of ideas about yesterday’s
    events or to contemplate the activities of the forthcoming day. This time can
    be extremely productive and can be a period of very meaningful and creative mental
    activity.”</em></p><p><strong>This creativity is vital</strong>. It allows us
    to think from a different perspective and see what we couldn’t see before.</p><p>Don’t
    make the mistake of thinking that writing morning pages is just for, say, creative
    writers. It can be used by anyone wanting to access their full range of brain
    power.</p><h2>Your Beautiful Mind</h2><p>Our mind is amazing. What I see in my
    personal experience and research on this topic is that it is possible to maximize
    our potential and productivity through a simple habit.</p><ul><li><p>Create a
    question.</p></li><li><p>Let that question resonate.</p></li><li><p>Trust your
    subconscious mind to come through for you.</p></li><li><p>Go do something else,
    like sleep.</p></li><li><p>Be ready and aware for the answer.</p></li></ul><p>Promoting
    greater balance and cohesion in my mind is important to me, as is working smarter—not
    just harder—to create what I want.</p><p>I’m no Einstein or Churchill, but by
    emulating their habits, I can better my own, and then let those habits improve
    my life. I also have less headaches now, and I’m having fun playing with this
    simple technique to increase my creativity, insight, and productivity.</p><p>After
    all, that’s not something that I’m going to lose any sleep over, right?</p>'

    one, simple truth:</p><blockquote><h1>Turning what you love into a business involves
    being good at business.</h1></blockquote><p>I write full-time for a living — a
    luxury I enjoy because I’m just as much of a business person as I am a writer.</p><p>While

    Elements of Style</a>, I also learned <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Million-Dollar-Consulting-Professionals-Practice/dp/1259588610">Million
    Dollar Consulting</a> (not affiliate links).</p><p>My business acumen said <em>don’t
    listen to the “pros” selling overnight self-publishing success</em>.</p><p>Not
    that I don’t want to self publish — and I’m definitely not condemning it — but,
    without a high number of followers (many thousands) or email subscribers (many
    thousands), self-publishing isn’t likely to earn a livable wage.</p><p>You can
    build a following and email list, and then self-publish profitably. But the likelihood
    that you’ll make money from your first book (immense amount of effort) is extremely
    low.</p><p>Even if you’re a best-seller in some random category no one has ever
    heard of — people don’t search for keywords they’ve never heard of.</p><p>You
    could invest money into ads for your self-published work, but then, you’d likely
    be far in the red before you start to make money. You’d be lucky to break even.</p><p>Or,
    you might write a dynamite book on your first try (highly unlikely) and sell the
    shit out of it without any marketing effort whatsoever (highly unlikely).</p><p>I
    asked myself — <em>would a smart business person gamble all that writing time
    and effort on something so unlikely to pay off?</em></p><h3>A better way to make
    money writing</h3><p>Here are a few mediums I’ve used to generate a significant
    income from my writing. I write or ghostwrite ebooks, blogs, articles, and emails
    for businesses.</p><p>I write for IT/tech companies, but you can choose any niche
    that interests you. I have friends that make money writing for lifestyle companies,
    yoga studios, medical journals, finance firms, law firms, women’s rights orgs,
    etc.</p><p>I was able to build a six-figure writing company with zero professional
    writing experience, zero followers, and zero people on an email list — using the
    tools I’m going to share here.</p><p><strong><em>I have no affiliation with any
    of these tools.</em></strong></p><h2>1. LinkedIn Profinder</h2><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profinder">LinkedIn
    Profinder</a> is one of my favorite tools for finding quality work. You can find
    decent paying gigs with small/medium businesses here. The way it works is that
    you create a profile and enter the type of work you’re looking for (content writing,
    ghostwriting, etc.).</p><p>Then, when companies create proposal requests for those
    types of work, you are notified and can apply to the gig.</p><p>It’s a passive
    medium, meaning, you wait for requests to come to you.</p><h3>Money I made from
    LinkedIn Profinder</h3><p>One-off writing/email project for $3k.</p><h2>2. Contena</h2><p><a
    href="https://www.contena.co/">Contena</a> is a job board that aggregates all
    the writing jobs posted on the web and puts them into one place. You can create
    alerts for yourself for specific job types like how well they pay, what niche,
    etc.</p><h3>Money I made from Contena</h3><p>Client 1: more than 0.25 USD per
    word for more than 6 months. Multiple articles per month. Total earnings about
    $10k.</p><p>Client 2: more than 0.25 USD per word for few projects sporadically
    for a year. Total earnings about $14k.</p><h2>3. Sending your own pitch 2X per
    week</h2><p>This is by far the best way to make money as a writer. Any time a
    company sends out an RFP or posts to a job board, thousands of writers see it
    and apply. If you send a pitch to a company, you’re likely the only person pitching.
    There’s much less competition.</p><p>You need to pitch in bulk. Make it a goal
    to pitch at least 100 companies per week. Ask to write for their blog. Find companies
    in industries you’re interested in writing about (i.e., fitness/lifestyle, tech
    startups, women’s health, etc.).</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@kayla.lee/20-minute-lead-gen-hacks-that-doubled-my-pipeline-1a03f605009c">I

  :title: Work/Life balance is bullshit.
  :content: "<p>by Tobias van Schneiderfirst appeared on my private email list.</p><p>There
    is no question being asked more often than how I manage my work/life balance.
    Every time someone asks me that question I struggle with a straight answer.</p><p>For
    me the concept of work/life balance is bullshit. The fact that we call it work/life
    balance automatically implies that one of the two is negative and we need to balance
    it with the other.</p><p>It usually implies that you have work on the evil side,
    and life on the other. It makes it look like these two things are competing for
    your attention and well being.</p><p>But work and life are not separate. They
    are the same, there is only one thing, it’s called LIFE. Work is part of my life,
    it’s not competing against it.</p><p>Family is important, friends are important.
    But work is a huge part of who I am as a person. I believe work is one of the
    most important things in ones life.</p><p>I believe that work is the reason why
    I get up in the morning. It’s what I love to do with most of my days.</p><p>Now
    some might say I’m speaking from a privileged place because I can decide what
    I want to work on every day. And maybe yes, that might be true to some extend,
    but it wasn’t true a couple years ago.</p><p><strong>I strongly believe that every
    person can make a living doing something they love. And often enough, it’s more
    of a mindset to become happy with your work. Often it’s not the work that sucks,
    but how we see it.</strong></p><p>I remember, many years ago I asked a “Waste
    Collector” on the street what happened that he has to work in this job? (notice
    how my question was with negative assumptions in the first place)</p><p>With a
    smile on his face he replied. “I’ve been working as a Garbage Guy for more than
    20 years now, I love this job and would never trade it for anything else.”</p><p>Completely
    shocked I asked him why. “You know, I can be outside every day and I have the
    honor to clean up the city. It’s like a computer game every day, street after
    street, faster than the other garbage guys.”</p><p>I loved his answer, and from
    that day on I stopped assuming that every waste collector in the city must hate
    their job. It gave me a different perspective on what work can mean.</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3000/1*ANsTjE0_sExFjlCz4r6apw.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Because ultimately, it’s only “work” if you don’t like
    it. If you love doing what you do, it doesn’t feel like work. And yes, you still
    need balance, because you need balance with everything yo do.</strong> For the
    same reason you can’t just eat only Nutella everyday. (trust me, I tried it)</p><p>But
    what you don’t need is life/work balance, because if you do, you might need to
    make some drastic changes with either one of them.</p><p>And this either means
    changing your job (yes you can) <strong>or simply looking at your job from a different
    perspective. Maybe you don’t like your job because society tells you it’s cool
    to hate what you do from Monday to Friday.</strong></p><p>I mean, just look at
    how much society celebrates Fridays and hates Mondays, but shouldn’t it be the
    other way around?</p><p>Imagine we would all love what we do so much, we would
    be all sad every Friday because it would take us away from something we love doing.</p><p>And
    I’m not saying there is something wrong with taking a break from any activity,
    but just the way we as society “hate” Mondays is what’s so surprising to me.</p><p>If
    I could decide, on Mondays we should all celebrate because the world is awake
    again. We can work, get some shit done and do what we love.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/vanschneider\">How
    do you feel about work/life balance? Let me know on Twitter please.</a></p><p>I

  :title: How to Get More Work Done in a Week Than Most People Do in a Month
  :content: '<p>There’s no single hack for getting more work done in less time, but
    instead a host of habits, and work systems can produce the best return on your
    time.</p><p>Getting more work done is about knowing what to do, when to do it,
    and how to get it done in the shortest possible time to maximise the little time
    you have everyday.</p><p>It means means choosing tasks that strategically align
    with your work objectives.</p><p>It’s the ratio between input and output.</p><h2>Is
    everything really urgent?</h2><p>What are the most important actions you can take
    today that will get your closer to your work goals in the shortest possible time?</p><p>Imagine
    the repercussions of choosing to do urgent (but not important) tasks instead of
    focusing on important actions.</p><p>“The secret to mastering your time is to
    systematically focus on importance and suppress urgency.”</p><p>Oliver Emberton
    said that.</p><p>It’s profound and so true.</p><p>Urgency wrecks productivity.</p><p>Urgent
    but unimportant tasks are major distractions.</p><p>In 1954, former U.S President
    Dwight D. Eisenhower said,</p><p><em>“I have two kinds of problems: the urgent
    and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.”</em></p><p>Separating
    important tasks from urgent ones is a problem for many people.</p><p>The urgent
    are not important, and the important are never urgent.</p><p>Urgent tasks put
    us into constant “reply mode.”</p><p>They are distractions.</p><p>Important work
    are tasks we have planned that move goals.</p><p>Our brains are so drawn to urgency
    that we choose “objectively worse options over objectively better (important)
    options.</p><p>To maximise time and do more focused work, question your choices
    constantly, and develop the ability to watch your mind as it gets whipped up by
    sudden requests.</p><p>When a task you have not planned to do falls onto your
    plate, ask yourself:</p><p>“Is this really important?”</p><p>And then think about
    not only how, but when, to best handle it.</p><h2>What’s on your plate?</h2><p>When
    you try to tackle too many tasks everyday, you will be overwhelmed and achieve
    less.</p><p><em>When everything</em> is important, you will be tempted to skillfully
    juggle multiple priorities at the same time, and your productivity suffers in
    the process.</p><p>It pays to prioritise your tasks and work on the most important
    ones first thing in the morning, when you are most active.</p><p>“Even if everything
    on your plate is <em>supposed</em> to be equally important, you still need a way
    to break down which ones you spend your time on, and how you slice up your time,”
    <a href="https://lifehacker.com/5877111/how-to-prioritize-when-everything-is-important">says</a>
    Alan Henry of Lifehacker</p><p>Whenever you are faced with a lot to do, take a
    step back to recognise the rushed mindset and its consequences.</p><p>Instead
    of rushing to get them done at the same time, start by asking yourself:</p><p>“Is
    this really important?”</p><p>And then think about not only how, but when, to
    best handle it.</p><p>Ultimately, the goal should be to question your choices
    constantly, and to develop the ability to recognise tasks that just distract you
    from your real work.</p><h2>Stop feeding your distractions</h2><p>Interruptions
    like notifications, loud noises, social media, someone knocking on your door,
    and switching to check emails every now and then, break your flow.</p><p>They
    interrupt your concentration.</p><p>They’re just enough to pull your focus away
    and make you have to start over.</p><p>Anytime you are pulled away from your tasks,
    it takes time to readjust to them when you jump back in — up to 25 minutes in
    many cases.</p><p>Your life keeps diminishing while you waste your time feeding
    your distractions.</p><p>Successful people prioritise! They focus! They disconnect
    from everything else to get tasks done.</p><p>Beware of deceptive time-wasting
    activities that disguise themselves as work; Lengthy discussions with colleagues,
    long meetings and treating other people’s work as “emergencies” when you should
    be concentrating on your high-value work.</p><p>Writing in the first century,
    <strong>Seneca</strong> was surprised by how little people seemed to value their
    lives as they were living them — how busy, terribly busy, everyone seemed to be,
    and wasteful of their time.</p><p>He noticed how even wealthy people hustled their
    lives along, ruing their fortune, anticipating a time in the future when they
    would rest.</p><blockquote><p><em>In his book (translated by John W. Basore),
    “<a href="http://amzn.to/2zx96eA">*On the Shortness of Life</a></em>,” *<em>Seneca
    *</em>offers powerful insights into the art of living. He observed, “It is not
    that we have so little time but that we lose so much. … The life we receive is
    not short but we make it so; we are not ill provided but use what we have wastefully.”*</p></blockquote><p>“Life
    is long if you know how to use it,” he counselled.</p><p>Take control of your
    time and start distributing it right.</p><p>Start by reviewing your daily routine.</p><p>Track
    your daily activities for some time to clearly see where your time is being spent.
    Meetings, phone calls, emails, notifications, small chats, and many other distractions
    are constantly splitting your attention.</p><p>Record ALL your appointments, deadlines,
    and everything in-between.Analyse the actual time you spend on each activity with
    what you think is the best amount for each.</p><p><strong>Schedule the heck out
    of your days. Schedule everything in advance.</strong></p><p>Make a plan and know
    what’s going on each day.</p><p>This helps you figure out how you’re spending
    your time</p><p>Notice where time leaks, then declutter your routine.</p><h2>Stop
    doing busywork</h2><p>Busy does not necessarily means productive.</p><p>Busy work
    makes you feel like you are moving quickly and being productive in the process.
    But in effect, you are not.</p><p>If you took time to measure your work, you will
    be surprised at how little valuable work you are doing.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160909-why-you-feel-busy-all-the-time-when-youre-actually-not">Oliver
    Burkeman</a> of BBC writes, “When you’re busy, you’re more likely to make poor
    time-management choices — taking on commitments you can’t handle, or prioritising
    trifling tasks over crucial ones. A vicious spiral kicks in: your feelings of
    busyness leave you even busier than before.”</p><blockquote><p><strong>Many of
    us confuse being “busy” with being effective, or efficient.</strong></p></blockquote><p>If
    you start your day by answering emails. You could get sucked into answering questions,
    replying to every email, and advancing the cause of other people’s actions.</p><p>Be
    proactive about your emails.</p><p>Don’t get caught up in reactive mode.</p><p>“Most
    of us have no problem with being busy, but we’re often busy on the wrong things,”
    says <strong>Angie Morgan</strong>, co-author of <a href="https://amzn.to/2uYlaUc">*Spark:
    How to Lead Yourself and Others to Greater Success</a>*. “You could spend nine
    to five just emailing, but that’s not driving results or moving you toward longer,
    bigger goals. When people say, ‘I’m so busy,’ it really means, ‘I’m a poor planner,’
    or, ‘I don’t know how to prioritise or delegate.”</p><p>Adopt the “one thing”
    approach.</p><p>Make the hard choices and work on your most important priorities
    instead of responding to urgent tasks.</p><p>Your time is limited. Doing everything
    is not an option.</p><h2>A simple system to change how you work</h2><p>Set a very
    clear intention of how your day will go the next morning, particularly in the
    beginning, the night before.</p><p>Visualising this intention and writing it down
    into your schedule can make it happen more automatically in the morning without
    wasting time.</p><p>Planning tomorrow today is a powerful habit that changes everyday.</p><p>It’s
    a system that can completely changes how you work:</p><ol><li><p><em>Before the
    day ends, identify and write down the best actions (to-do) you need to take tomorrow
    that will help you get closer to your work goals.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Every
    morning, focus on completing your action list from yesterday before midday.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Rinse,
    improve and repeat. Every day. Every week. Every month. Every year.</em></p></li></ol><p>You
    could double your efficiency with this simple process/habit.</p><h2>Adopt the
    1–3–5 method to create and manage your action list for the day</h2><p>On any given
    day, assume that you can only accomplish one big thing, three medium things, and
    five small things, and narrow down your to-do list to those nine items.</p><p>This
    means that your daily schedule will feature:</p><ol><li><p>One very important
    task;</p></li><li><p>Three tasks of medium importance</p></li><li><p>Five little
    things</p></li></ol><p>Of course, this can be flexible, depending on important
    actions you need to take to advance your work goals.</p><p>A daily priority list
    gives you a great roadmap to follow so that you don’t feel overwhelmed and don’t
    have to waste time thinking about what needs done.</p><p>I use a combination of
    these methods to get through the day depending on how much work I have to get
    through.</p><p>As you practice being ruthless with your to-do, you’ll find it
    gets easier and you’ll be able to pick the right method at the right time.</p>'

  :content: '<p>Blockchain technology explained in simple words</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/10630/1*YTwz_rEmaFjkq6hQBjnHvg.jpeg"
    alt="Credit: Ani_Ka/DigitalVision Vectors/Getty"><em>Credit: Ani_Ka/DigitalVision
    Vectors/Getty</em></p><p>Blockchain technology is probably the best invention
    since the internet itself. It allows value exchange without the need for trust
    or a central authority. Imagine you and I bet $50 on tomorrow’s weather in San
    Francisco. I bet it will be sunny, you that it will rain. Today we have three
    options to manage this transaction:</p><ol><li><p>We can <em>trust</em> each other.
    Rainy or sunny, the loser will give $50 to the winner. If we are friends, this
    could be a good way of managing it. However, friends or strangers, one can easily
    not pay the other.</p></li><li><p>We can turn the bet into a <em>contract</em>.
    With a contract in place both parties will be more prone to pay. However, should
    either of the two decide not to pay, the winner will have to pay additional money
    to cover legal expenses and the court case might take a long time. Especially
    for a small amount of cash, this doesn’t seem like the optimal way to manage the
    transaction.</p></li><li><p>We can involve a <em>neutral third party</em>. Each
    of us gives $50 to a third party, who will give the total amount to the winner.
    But hey, she could also run away with all our money. So we end up with one of
    the first two options: <em>trust</em> or <em>contract</em>.</p></li></ol><p>Neither
    trust nor contract is an optimal solution: We can’t trust strangers, and enforcing
    a contract requires time and money. The blockchain technology is interesting because
    it offers us a third option which is secure, quick, and cheap.</p><p>Blockchain
    allows us to write a few lines of code, a program running on the blockchain, to
    which both of us send $50. This program will keep the $100 safe and check tomorrow’s
    weather automatically on several data sources. Sunny or rainy, it will automatically
    transfer the whole amount to the winner. Each party can check the contract logic,
    and once it’s running on the blockchain it can’t be changed or stopped. This may
    be too much effort for a $50 bet, but imagine selling a house or a company.</p><p>This
    article explains how the blockchain works without discussing the technical details
    in depth, but by digging just enough to give you a general idea of the underlying
    logic and mechanisms.</p><p><em>Also available in <a href="https://ethfans.org/posts/how-does-the-blockchain-work-edited-version">Simplified
    Chinese</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@benzwjian/%E5%8D%80%E5%A1%8A%E9%8F%88%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E9%81%8B%E4%BD%9C-b7c8d4131a0e">Mandarin</a>

    Basics of Bitcoin</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/1*yYdtODWoEQupl73_r8EhUA.png"
    alt="Images courtesy of author."><em>Images courtesy of author.</em></p><p>The
    most known and discussed application of the blockchain technology is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">bitcoin</a>,
    a digital currency that can be used to exchange products and services, just like
    the U.S. dollar, euro, Chinese yuan, and other national currencies. Let’s use
    this first application of the blockchain technology to learn how it works.</p><blockquote><p>“Bitcoin
    gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique
    piece of digital property to another Internet user, such that the transfer is
    guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place,
    and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. The consequences of this
    breakthrough are hard to overstate.”— Marc Andreessen</p></blockquote><p>One bitcoin
    is a single unit of the Bitcoin (BTC) digital currency. Just like a dollar, a
    bitcoin has no value by itself; it has value only because we agree to trade goods
    and services to bring more of the currency under our control, and we believe others
    will do the same.</p><p>To keep track of the amount of bitcoin each of us owns,
    the blockchain uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger">ledger</a>,
    a digital file that tracks all bitcoin transactions.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/1*Serfj4A5sFZzH_gpQk9qJQ.png"
    alt="Fig. 1 - Bitcoin ledger digital file simplified"><em>Fig. 1 - Bitcoin ledger
    digital file simplified</em></p><p>The ledger file is not stored in a central
    entity server, like a bank, or in a single data center. It is distributed across
    the world via a network of private computers that are both storing data and executing
    computations. Each of these computers represents a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_%28networking%29">node</a>”
    of the blockchain network and has a copy of the ledger file.</p><p>If David wants
    to send bitcoins to Sandra, he broadcasts a message to the network that says the
    amount of bitcoin in his account should go down by 5 BTC, and the amount in Sandra’s
    account should increase by the same quantity. Each node in the network will receive
    the message and apply the requested transaction to its copy of the ledger, updating
    the account balances.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3032/1*bJQyDZtJikR7mBVuhVGpBw.png"
    alt="Fig. 2 - Transaction request message simplified"><em>Fig. 2 - Transaction
    request message simplified</em></p><p>The fact that the ledger is maintained by
    a group of connected computers rather than by a centralized entity like a bank
    has several implications:</p><ul><li><p>In our bank system we only know our own
    transactions and account balances; on the blockchain everyone can see everyone
    else’s transactions.</p></li><li><p>While you can generally trust your bank, the
    bitcoin network is distributed and if something goes wrong there is no help desk
    to call or anyone to sue.</p></li><li><p>The blockchain system is designed in
    such a way that no trust is needed; security and reliability are obtained via
    special mathematical functions and code.</p></li></ul><p>We can define the blockchain
    as a system that allows a group of connected computers to maintain a single updated
    and secure ledger. In order to perform transactions on the blockchain, you need
    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Wallets">wallet</a>, a program
    that allows you to store and exchange your bitcoins. Since only you should be
    able to spend your bitcoins, each wallet is protected by a special cryptographic
    method that uses a unique pair of distinct but connected keys: a private and a
    public key.</p><p>If a message is encrypted with a specific public key, only the
    owner of the paired private key can decrypt and read the message. The reverse
    is also true: If you encrypt a message with your private key, only the paired
    public key can decrypt it. When David wants to send bitcoins, he needs to broadcast
    a message encrypted with the private key of his wallet. As David is the only one
    who knows the private key necessary to unlock his wallet, he is the only one who
    can spend his bitcoins. Each node in the network can cross-check that the transaction
    request is coming from David by decrypting the message with the public key of
    his wallet.</p><p>When you encrypt a transaction request with your wallet’s private
    key, you are generating a digital signature that is used by blockchain computers
    to verify the source and authenticity of the transaction. The digital signature
    is a string of text resulting from your transaction request and your private key;
    therefore it cannot be used for other transactions. If you change a single character
    in the transaction request message, the digital signature will change, so no potential
    attacker can change your transaction requests or alter the amount of bitcoin you
    are sending.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3208/1*pRMj7C7wsAWinpE3Yf9LDQ.png"
    alt="Fig. 3 - Digital Signature transaction encryption simplified"><em>Fig. 3
    - Digital Signature transaction encryption simplified</em></p><p>To send bitcoin
    you need to prove that you own the private key of a specific wallet as you need
    the key to encrypt your transaction request message. Since you broadcast the message
    only after it has been encrypted, you never have to reveal your private key.</p><h2>Tracking
    Your Wallet Balance</h2><p>Each node in the blockchain is keeping a copy of the
    ledger*. *So, how does a node know your account balance? The blockchain system
    doesn’t keep track of account balances at all; it only records each and every
    transaction that is verified and approved. The ledger in fact does not keep track
    of balances, it only keeps track of every transaction broadcasted within the bitcoin
    network (Fig. 4). To determine your wallet balance, you need to analyze and verify
    all the transactions that ever took place on the whole network connected to your
    wallet.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3184/1*VlFdSYyVBe46fTcUFLzpHw.png"
    alt="Fig. 4 - Blockchain Ledger"><em>Fig. 4 - Blockchain Ledger</em></p><p>This
    “balance” verification is performed based on links to previous transactions. In
    order to send 10 bitcoins to John, Mary has to generate a transaction request
    that includes links to previous incoming transactions that add up to at least
    10 bitcoins. These links are called “inputs.” Nodes in the network verify the
    amount and ensure that these inputs haven’t been spent yet. In fact, each time
    you reference inputs in a transaction, they are deemed invalid for any future
    transaction. This is all performed automatically in Mary’s wallet and double-checked
    by the bitcoin network nodes; she only sends a 10 BTC transaction to John’s wallet
    using his public key.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3020/1*pdbhdHDpX2RTF1CG2fbSkg.png"
    alt="Fig. 5 - Blockchain transaction request structure"><em>Fig. 5 - Blockchain
    transaction request structure</em></p><p>So, how can the system trust that input
    transactions are valid? It checks all the previous transactions correlated to
    the wallet you use to send bitcoins via the input references. To speed up the
    verification process, a special record of unspent transactions is kept by the
    network nodes. Thanks to this security check, it is not possible to double-spend
    bitcoins.</p><p>Owning bitcoins means that there are transactions written in the
    ledger that point to your wallet address and haven’t been used as inputs yet.
    All the code to perform transactions on the bitcoin network is open source; this
    means that anyone with a laptop and an internet connection can operate transactions.
    However, should there be a mistake in the code used to broadcast a transaction
    request message, the associated bitcoins will be permanently lost.</p><p>Remember
    that since the network is distributed, there is no customer support to call nor
    anyone who could help you restore a lost transaction or forgotten wallet password.
    For this reason, if you are interested in transacting on the bitcoin network,
    it’s a good idea to use the open source and official version of bitcoin wallet
    software (such as <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/download">Bitcoin Core</a>),
    and to store your wallet’s password or private key in a very safe repository.</p><h2>But
    Is It Really Safe? And Why Is It Called Blockchain?</h2><p>Anyone can access the
    bitcoin network via an anonymous connection (for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29">TOR
    network</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN
    network</a>), and submit or receive transactions revealing nothing more than his
    public key. However if someone uses the same public key over and over, it’s possible
    to connect all the transactions to the same owner. The bitcoin network allows
    you to generate as many wallets as you like, each with its own private and public
    keys. This allows you to receive payments on different wallets, and there is no
    way for anyone to know that you own all these wallets’ private keys, unless you
    send all the received bitcoins to a single wallet.</p><blockquote><h1>The total
    number of possible bitcoin addresses is 2¹⁶⁰ or 1461501637330902918203684832716283019655932542976.</h1></blockquote><p>This
    large number protects the network from possible attacks while allowing anyone
    to own a wallet.</p><p>With this setup, there is still a major security hole that
    could be exploited to recall bitcoins after spending them. Transactions are passed
    from node to node within the network, so the order in which two transactions reach
    each node can be different. An attacker could send a transaction, wait for the
    counterpart to ship a product, and then send a reverse transaction back to his
    own account. In this case, some nodes could receive the second transaction before
    the first and therefore consider the initial payment transaction invalid, as the
    transaction inputs would be marked as already spent. How do you know which transaction
    has been requested first? It’s not secure to order the transactions by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timestamp">timestamp</a>
    because it could easily be counterfeit. Therefore, there is no way to tell if
    a transaction happened before another, and this opens up the potential for fraud.</p><p>If
    this happens, there will be disagreement among the network nodes regarding the
    order of transactions each of them received. So the blockchain system has been
    designed to use node agreement to order transactions and prevent the fraud described
    above.</p><p>The bitcoin network orders transactions by grouping them into <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_%28database%29#Blocks">blocks</a>;
    each block contains a definite number of transactions and a link to the previous
    block. This is what puts one block after the other in time. Blocks are therefore
    organized into a time-related chain (Fig. 6) that gives the name to the whole
    system: <em>blockchain</em>.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/1*YrmY7iWMK6xN7vGSPrBYlA.png"
    alt="Fig. 6 — The block chain sequence structure simplified"><em>Fig. 6 — The
    block chain sequence structure simplified</em></p><p>Transactions in the same
    block are considered to have happened at the same time, and transactions not yet
    in a block are considered unconfirmed. Each node can group transactions into a
    block and broadcast it to the network as a suggestion for which block should be
    next. Since any node can suggest a new block, how does the system agree on which
    block should be the next?</p><p>To be added to the blockchain, each block* *must
    contain the answer to a complex mathematical problem created using an irreversible
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic
    hash function</a>. The only way to solve such a mathematical problem is to guess
    random numbers that, combined with the previous block content, generate a defined
    result. It could take about a year for a typical computer to guess the right number
    and solve the mathematical problem. However, due to the large number of computers
    in the network that are guessing numbers, a block is solved on average every 10
    minutes. The node that solves the mathematical problem acquires the right to place
    the next block on the chain and broadcast it to the network.</p><p>And what if
    two nodes solve the problem at the same time and send their blocks to the network
    simultaneously? In this case, both blocks are broadcast and each node builds on
    the block that it received first. However, the blockchain system requires each
    node to build immediately on the longest blockchain available. So if there is
    ambiguity about which is the last block, as soon as the next block is solved,
    each node will adopt the longest chain as the only option.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2768/1*t8C3VfeVf49bdfUZecBtbg.png"
    alt="Fig.7 - End of chain ambiguity logic"><em>Fig.7 - End of chain ambiguity
    logic</em></p><p>Due to the low probability of solving blocks simultaneously,
    it’s almost impossible that multiple blocks would be solved at the same time over
    and over, building different “tails,” so the whole blockchain stabilizes quickly
    to one single string of blocks that every node agrees on.</p><p>A disagreement
    about which block represents the end of the chain tail opens up the potential
    for fraud again. If a transaction happens to be in a block that belongs to a shorter
    tail (like block B in Fig. 7), once the next block is solved, this transaction,
    along with all others in its block, will go back to the unconfirmed transactions.</p><blockquote><h1>Transactions
    in the Bitcoin blockchain system are protected by a mathematical race: Any attacker
    is competing against the whole network.</h1></blockquote><p>Let’s see how Mary
    could leverage this end-of-chain ambiguity to perform a double-spending attack.
    Mary sends money to John, John ships the product to Mary. Since nodes always adopt
    the longer tail as the confirmed transactions, if Mary could generate a longer
    tail that contains a reverse transaction with the same input references, John
    would be out of both his money and his product.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2920/1*2U-gI4x2bBrAurI9d_nfuQ.png"
    alt="Fig. 8 - Mary’s double-spending attack"><em>Fig. 8 - Mary’s double-spending
    attack</em></p><p>How does the system prevent this kind of fraud? Each block contains
    a reference to the previous block* *(see Fig. 6). That reference is part of the
    mathematical problem that needs to be solved in order to spread the following
    block to the network. So, it’s extremely hard to pre-compute a series of blocks
    due to the high number of random guesses needed to solve a block and place it
    on the blockchain. Mary is in a race against the rest of the network to solve
    the math problem that allows her to place the next block on the chain. Even if
    she solves it before anyone else, it’s very unlikely she could solve two, three,
    or more blocks in a row, since each time she is competing against the whole network.</p><p>Could
    Mary use a super fast computer to generate enough random guesses to compete with
    the whole network in solving blocks? Yes, but even with a very, very fast computer,
    due to the large number of members in the network, it’s highly unlikely Mary could
    solve several blocks in a row at the exact time needed to perform a double-spending
    attack.</p><p>She would need control of 50 percent of the computing power of the
    whole network to have a 50 percent chance of solving a block before some other
    node does — and even in this case, she’d only have a 25 percent chance of solving
    two blocks in a row. The more blocks to be solves in a row, the lower the probability
    of her success. Transactions in the bitcoin blockchain system are protected by
    a mathematical race: Any attacker is competing against the entire network.</p><p>Therefore,
    transactions grow more secure with time. Those included in a block confirmed one
    hour ago, for example, are more secure than those in a block confirmed in the
    last 10 minutes<em>.</em> Since a block is added to the chain every 10 minutes
    on average, a transaction included in a block for the first time an hour ago has
    most likely been processed and is now irreversible.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2872/1*2yGwYXgCvLcZl3MoW044tg.png"
    alt="Fig. 9 - Blockchain transactions security"><em>Fig. 9 - Blockchain transactions
    security</em></p><h2>Mining Bitcoin</h2><p>In order to send bitcoins, you need
    to reference an incoming transaction to your own wallet. This applies to every
    single transaction across the network. So, where do bitcoins come from in the
    first place?</p><p>As a way to balance the deflationary nature of bitcoin due
    to software errors and wallet password loss, a reward is given to those who solve
    the mathematical problem of each block. The activity of running the bitcoin blockchain
    software in order to obtain these bitcoin rewards is called “mining” — and it’s
    very much like mining gold.</p><p>Rewards are the main incentive for private people
    to operate the nodes, thus providing the necessary computing power to process
    transactions and stabilize the blockchain network.</p><p>Because it takes a long
    time for a typical computer to solve a block* *(about one year on average), nodes
    band together in groups that divide up the number of guesses to solve the next
    block. Working as a group speeds up the process of guessing the right number and
    getting the reward, which is then shared among group members. These groups are
    called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_pool">mining pools</a>.</p><p>Some
    of these mining pools are very large, and represent more than 20 percent of the
    total network computing power. This has clear implications for network security,
    as seen in the double-spend attack example above. Even if one of these pools could
    potentially gain 50 percent of the network computing power, the further back along
    the chain a block goes, the more secure the transactions within it become.</p><p>However,
    some of these mining pools with substantial computing power have decided to limit
    their members in order to safeguard overall network security.</p><p>Since the
    overall network computing power is likely to increase over time due to technological
    innovation and the increasing number of nodes, the blockchain system recalibrates
    the mathematical difficulty of solving the next block to target 10 minutes on
    average for the entire network. This ensures the network’s stability and overall
    security.</p><p>Moreover, every four years the block reward is cut in half, so
    mining bitcoin (running the network) gets less interesting over time. To encourage
    nodes to keep operating, small reward fees can be attached to each transaction;
    these rewards are collected by the node that successfully includes such transactions
    in a block and solves its mathematical problem. Due to this mechanism, transactions
    associated with a higher reward are usually processed faster than those associated
    with a low reward. What this means is that, when sending a transaction, you can
    decide if you’d like to process it faster (more expensive) or cheaper (takes more
    time). Transaction fees in the bitcoin network are currently very small compared
    with what banks charge, and they’re not associated with the transaction amount.</p><h2>Blockchain
    Benefits and Challenges</h2><p>Now that you have a general understanding of how
    the blockchain works, let’s take a quick look at why it’s so interesting.</p><p>Using
    blockchain technology has remarkable benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You have complete
    control of the value you own; there is no third party that holds your value or
    can limit your access to it.</p></li><li><p>The cost to perform a value transaction
    from and to anywhere on the planet is very low. This allows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropayment">micropayments</a>.</p></li><li><p>Value
    can be transferred in a few minutes, and the transaction can be considered secure
    after a few hours, rather than days or weeks.</p></li><li><p>Anyone at any time
    can verify every transaction made on the blockchain, resulting in full transparency.</p></li><li><p>It’s
    possible to leverage the blockchain technology to build <a href="http://bit.ly/wieth">decentralized
    applications</a> that would be able to manage information and transfer value fast
    and securely.</p></li></ul><p>However, there are a few challenges that need to
    be addressed:</p><ul><li><p>Transactions can be sent and received anonymously.
    This preserves user privacy, but it also allows illegal activity on the network.</p></li><li><p>Though
    many exchange platforms are emerging, and digital currencies are gaining popularity,
    it’s still not easy to trade bitcoins for goods and services.</p></li><li><p>Bitcoin,
    like many other cryptocurrencies, is very volatile: There aren’t many bitcoins
    available in the market and the demand is changing rapidly. Bitcoin price is erratic,
    changing based on large events or announcements in the cryptocurrencies industry.</p></li></ul><p>Overall,
    the blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize several industries,
    from advertising to energy distribution. Its main power lies in its decentralized
    nature and ability to eliminate the need for trust.</p><p>New use cases are arising
    all the time — like the possibility of creating a fully decentralized platform
    that runs smart contracts like Ethereum. But it’s important to remember that the
    technology is still in its infancy. New tools are being developed every day to
    improve blockchain security while offering a broader range of features, tools,
    and services.</p><h3>Useful Links</h3><ul><li><p>Get your own <a href="http://bit.ly/2kkI86I">Bitcoin

    the effects of <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_dsleaders">unwise choices</a> can
    be devastating. In addition to mismanaged teams and unnecessary <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_roles">hires</a>,
    you’ll see the real heroes quitting or re-educating themselves to fit your incentives
    du jour. A prime example of this phenomenon is in analytics.</p><h3>Shopping for
    the trophy hire</h3><p>The top trophy hire in <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_datasci">data
    science</a> is elusive, and it’s no surprise: “full-stack” data scientist means
    mastery of <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_emperor">machine learning</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_statistics">statistics</a>,
    and <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_datasci">analytics</a>. When teams can’t get
    their hands on a three-in-one polymath, they set their sights on luring the most
    impressive prize among the <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_bubble">single-origin
    specialists</a>. Who gets the pedestal?</p><p><a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_bubble">Today’s
    fashion in data science</a> favors flashy sophistication with a dash of sci-fi,
    making <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_ai">AI and machine learning</a> darlings
    of the hiring circuit. Alternative challengers for the alpha spot come from <a
    href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_statistics">statistics</a>, thanks to a century-long
    reputation for rigor and mathematical superiority. What about analysts?</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0*GrXjSR4wjPVJQjqR.jpg" alt=""></p><h3>Analytics
    as a second-class citizen</h3><p>If your primary skill is <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_datasci">analytics</a>
    (or data-mining or business intelligence), chances are that your self-confidence
    takes a beating when your aforementioned compatriots strut past you and the job
    market drops not-so-subtle hints about leveling up your skills to join them.</p><blockquote><h1>Good
    analysts are a prerequisite for effectiveness in your data endeavors. It’s dangerous
    to have them quit on you, but that’s exactly what they’ll do if you under-appreciate
    them.</h1></blockquote><p>What the uninitiated rarely grasp is that the three
    professions under the <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_datasci">data science umbrella</a>
    are completely different from one another. They may use the same equations, but
    that’s where the similarity ends. Far from being a sloppy version of other data
    science breeds, good analysts are a prerequisite for effectiveness in your data
    endeavors. It’s dangerous to have them quit on you, but that’s exactly what they’ll
    do if you under-appreciate them.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*uQHKW0i_wSzljUlQ.jpg"
    alt=""></p><h3>Alike in dignity</h3><p>Instead of asking an analyst to develop
    their <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_statistics">statistics</a> or <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_simplest">machine
    learning</a> skills, consider encouraging them to seek the heights of their own
    discipline first. <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_datasci">Data science</a> is
    the kind of beast where excellence in one area beats mediocrity in two.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Each
    of the three data science disciplines has its own excellence. Statisticians bring
    rigor, ML engineers bring performance, and analysts bring speed.</em></h1></blockquote><p>At
    peak expertise, all three are equally pedestal-worthy but they provide very different
    services. To understand the subtleties, let’s examine what it means to be truly
    excellent in each of the data science disciplines, what value they bring, and
    which personality traits are required to survive each job.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*4kwwAk_qgtC1kFet.jpg"
    alt=""></p><h3>Excellence in statistics: rigor</h3><p>As specialists in coming
    to conclusions beyond your data safely, <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_statistics">statisticians</a>
    are your best protection against fooling yourself in an uncertain world. To them,
    inferring something sloppily is a greater sin than leaving your mind a blank slate,
    so expect a good statistician to put the brakes on your exuberance. Constantly
    on tiptoe, they care deeply about whether the methods applied are <em>right</em>
    for the problem and they agonize over which inferences are valid from the information
    at hand.</p><p>What most people don’t realize is that <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_statistics">statisticians</a>
    are essentially epistemologists. Since there’s no magic that makes certainty out
    of uncertainty, their role is not to produce Truth but rather a sensible integration
    of palatable assumptions with available information.</p><p>*<em>The result? *</em>A
    perspective that helps leaders make important decisions in a risk-controlled manner.</p><p>Unsurprisingly,
    many statisticians react with vitriol toward “upstarts” who learn the equations
    without absorbing any of the philosophy. If dealing with statisticians seems exhausting,
    here’s a quick fix: don’t come to any conclusions beyond your data and you won’t
    need their services. (<em>Easier said than done, right? Especially if you want
    to make an important launch decision.</em>)</p><h3>Excellence in machine learning:
    performance</h3><p>You might be an <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_realitycheck">applied
    machine learning</a> / AI engineer if your response to “<em>I bet you couldn’t
    build a model that passes testing at 99.99999% accuracy</em>” is “<em>Watch me.</em>”
    With the coding chops build prototypes and production systems that <em>work</em>
    and the stubborn resilience to fail every hour for several years if that’s what
    it takes, machine learning specialists know that they won’t find the perfect solution
    in a textbook. Instead, they’ll be engaged in a <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_emperor">marathon
    of trial-and-error</a>. Having <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_roles">great intuition
    for how long it’ll take</a> them to try each new option is a huge plus and is
    more valuable than an intimate knowledge of how the algorithms work (though it’s
    nice to have both).</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*wEa4dfs1rAsCY7jd.jpg"
    alt="“I’ll make it work.” -Engineer"><em>“I’ll make it work.” -Engineer</em></p><p>*<em>The
    result? *</em>A system that automates a tricky task well enough to pass your statistician’s
    strict testing bar and deliver the audacious performance a business leader demanded.</p><p>Performance
    means more than clearing a metric — it also means reliable, scalable, and easy-to-maintain
    models that perform well in production. Engineering excellence is a must.</p><h3>Wide
    versus deep</h3><p>What the previous two roles have in common is that they both
    provide high-effort solutions to specific problems. If the problems they tackle
    aren’t worth solving, you end up wasting their time and your money. A frequent
    lament among business leaders is, <em>“<a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_dsleaders">Our
    data science group is useless.</a>”</em> and the problem usually lies in an absence
    of analytics expertise.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*TsayEbu-XOnT_0Gb.jpg"
    alt=""></p><p><a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_statistics">Statisticians</a> and
    <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_simplest">machine learning</a> engineers are narrow-and-deep
    (the shape of a rabbit hole, incidentally) workers, so it’s really important to
    point them at problems that deserve the effort. If your experts are carefully
    solving the wrong problems, of course your investment in data science suffers
    low returns. To ensure that you can make good use of <em>narrow-and-deep</em>
    experts, you either need to be sure you already have the right problem or you
    need a <em>wide-and-shallow</em> approach to finding one.</p><h3>Excellence in
    analytics: speed</h3><p>The best analysts are lightning-fast coders who can surf
    vast datasets quickly, encountering and surfacing potential insights faster than
    the those other specialists can say “whiteboard.” Their semi-sloppy coding style
    baffles traditional software engineers… until it leaves them in the dust. Speed
    is the highest virtue, closely followed by the trait of not snoozing past potentially
    useful gems. A mastery of visual presentation of information helps with speed
    bottlenecks on the brain side: beautiful and effective plots allow the mind to
    extract information faster, which pays off in time-to-potential-insights.</p><blockquote><h1>Where
    statisticians and ML folk are slow, analysts are a whirlwind of inspiration for
    decision-makers and other data science colleagues.</h1></blockquote><p><strong>The
    result:</strong> the business gets a finger on its pulse and eyes on previously-unknown
    unknowns. This generates the inspiration that helps decision-makers select valuable
    quests to send statisticians and ML engineers on, saving them from mathematically-impressive
    excavations of useless rabbit holes.</p><h3>Sloppy nonsense or stellar storytelling?</h3><p><em>“But,”</em>
    object the statisticians, <em>“most of their so-called insights are nonsense.”</em>
    By that they mean the results of their exploration may reflect only noise. Perhaps,
    but there’s more to the story.</p><p>Analysts are data storytellers. Their mandate
    is to summarize interesting facts and be careful to point out that any poetic
    inspiration that comes along for the ride is not to be taken seriously without
    a statistical follow-up.</p><blockquote><h1>Buyer beware: there are many data
    charlatans out there posing as data scientists. There’s no magic that makes certainty
    out of uncertainty.</h1></blockquote><p>Good analysts have unwavering respect
    for the one golden rule of their profession:** do not come to conclusions beyond
    the data** (and prevent your audience from doing it too). Unfortunately, relatively
    few analysts are the real deal — buyer beware: there are many data charlatans
    out there posing as <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_bubble">data scientists</a>.
    These peddle nonsense, leaping beyond the data in undisciplined ways to “support”
    decisions based on wishful thinking. If your ethical standards are lax, perhaps
    you’d keep these snake oil salesmen around and house them in the marketing dark
    arts part of your business. Personally, I’d prefer not to.</p><blockquote><h1>Good
    analysts have unwavering respect for the one golden rule of their profession:**
    do not come to conclusions beyond the data.**</h1></blockquote><p>As long as analysts
    stick to the facts (<em>“This is what is here.” *But what does it mean? *“Only:
    This is what is here.”</em>) and don’t take themselves too seriously, the worst
    crime they could commit is wasting someone’s time when they run it by them. Out
    of respect for their golden rule, good analysts use softened, hedging language
    (for example, not “we conclude” but “we are inspired to wonder”) and discourage
    leader overconfidence by emphasizing a multitude of possible interpretations for
    every insight.</p><p>While statistical skills are required to test hypotheses,
    analysts are your best bet for coming up with those hypotheses in the first place.
    For instance, they might say something like “It’s only a correlation, but I suspect
    it could be driven by …” and then explain why they think that.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/0*XEMvHIg7rO9E9gZf.jpg"
    alt=""></p><p>This takes strong intuition about what might be going on beyond
    the data, and the communication skills to convey the options to the decision-maker,
    who typically calls the shots on which hypotheses (of many) are important enough
    to warrant a statistician’s effort. As analysts mature, they’ll begin to get the
    hang of judging what’s important in addition to what’s interesting, allowing decision-makers
    to step away from the middleman role.</p><blockquote><h1>Of the three breeds,
    analysts are the most likely heirs to the decision throne.</h1></blockquote><p>Because
    subject matter expertise goes a long way towards helping you spot interesting
    patterns in your data faster, the best analysts are serious about familiarizing
    themselves with the domain. Failure to do so is a red flag. As their curiosity
    pushes them to develop a sense for the business, expect their output to shift
    from a jumble of false alarms to a sensibly-curated set of insights that decision-makers
    are more likely to care about.</p><p>To avoid wasted time, analysts should lay
    out the story they’re tempted to tell and poke it from several angles with follow-up
    investigations to see if it holds water before bringing it to decision-makers.
    If a decision-maker is in danger of being driven to take an important action based
    on an inspiring story, <em>that</em> is the Bat-Signal for the statisticians to
    swoop in and check (in <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_sydd">new data</a>, of
    course) that the action is a wise choice in light of assumptions the decision-maker
    is willing to live with and their appetite for risk.</p><h3>The analyst-statistician
    hybrid</h3><p>For analysts sticking to the facts, there’s no such thing as wrong,
    there’s only slow. Adding statistical expertise to “do things correctly” misses
    the point in an important way, especially because there’s a very important filter
    between exploratory data analytics and statistical rigor: the decision-maker.
    Someone with decision responsibility has to sign off on the business impact of
    pursuing the analyst’s insight being worth a high-effort expert’s time. Unless
    the analyst-statistician hybrid is also a skilled decision-maker and business
    leader, their skillset forms a sandwich with a chasm in the middle.</p><p>An analyst
    who bridges that gap, however, is worth their weight in gold. Treasure them!</p><h3>Analytics
    for machine learning and AI</h3><p>Machine learning specialists put a bunch of
    potential data inputs through algorithms, tweak the settings, and keep iterating
    until the right outputs are produced. While it may sound like there’s no role
    for analytics here, in practice a business often has far too many potential ingredients
    to shove into the blender all at once.</p><blockquote><h1>Your analyst is the
    sprinter; their ability to quickly help you see and summarize <em>what-is-here</em>
    is a superpower for your process.</h1></blockquote><p>One way to filter down to
    a promising set to try is domain expertise — ask a human with opinions about how
    things might work. Another way is through analytics. To use the analogy of cooking,
    the machine learning engineer is great at tinkering in the kitchen, but right
    now they’re standing in front of a huge, dark warehouse full of potential ingredients.
    They could either start grabbing them haphazardly and dragging them back to their
    kitchens, or they could send a sprinter armed with a flashlight through the warehouse
    first. Your analyst is the sprinter; their ability to quickly help you see and
    summarize <em>what-is-here</em> is a superpower for your process.</p><h3>The analyst-ML
    expert hybrid</h3><p>Analysts accelerate machine learning projects, so dual skillsets
    are very useful. Unfortunately, because of the differences in coding style and
    approach between analytics and <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_roles">ML engineering</a>,
    it’s unusual to see peak expertise in one individual (and even rarer to that person
    to be slow and philosophical when needed, which is why the true <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_roles">full-stack
    data scientist</a> is a rare beast indeed).</p><h3>Dangers of chronic under-appreciation</h3><p>An
    expert analyst is not a shoddy version of the machine learning engineer, their
    coding style is optimized for speed — on purpose. Nor are they a bad statistician,
    since they don’t deal at all with uncertainty, they deal with facts. <em>“Here’s
    what’s in our data, it’s not my job to talk about what it means beyond the present
    data, but perhaps it will inspire the decision-maker to pursue the question with
    a statistician…”</em></p><p>What beginners don’t realize is that the work requires
    top <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_datasci">analysts</a> to have a better grasp
    of the mathematics of data science than either of the other <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_roles">applied
    breeds</a>. Unless the task is complicated enough that it demands the invention
    a new hypothesis test or algorithm (the work of <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_roles">researchers</a>),
    statisticians and ML specialists can rely on checking that off-the-shelf packages
    and tests are right for the job, but they can often skip having to face the equations
    themselves.</p><p>For example, statisticians might forget the equations for a
    <em>t</em>-test’s <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_statistics">p-value</a> because
    they get it by hitting run on a software package, but they never forget how and
    when to use one, as well as the correct philosophical interpretation of the results.
    Analysts, on the other hand, aren’t looking to interpret. They’re after a view
    into the shape of a gory, huge, multidimensional dataset. By knowing the way the
    equation for the p-value slices their dataset, they can form a reverse view of
    what the patterns in original dataset must have been to produce the number they
    saw. Without an appreciation of the math, you don’t get that view. Unlike a statistician,
    though, they don’t care if the <em>t</em>-test is <em>right</em> for the data.
    They care that the t-test gives them a useful view of what’s going on in the current
    dataset. The distinction is subtle, but it’s important.</p><blockquote><h1>Statisticians
    deal with things outside the data, while analysts stick to things inside it.</h1></blockquote><p>At
    peak excellence, both are deeply mathematical and they often use the same equations,
    but their jobs are entirely different.</p><p>Similarly, analysts often use machine
    learning <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_emperor">algorithms</a> to slice their
    data, identify compelling groupings, and examine anomalies. Since their goal is
    not performance but inspiration, their approach is different and might appear
    sloppy to the <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_roles">ML engineer</a>. Again, it’s
    the use of the same tool for a different job.</p><p>To summarize what’s going
    on with an analogy: pins are used by surgeons, tailors, and office workers. That
    doesn’t mean the jobs are the same or even comparable, and it would be dangerous
    to encourage all your tailors and office workers to study surgery to progress
    in their careers.</p><blockquote><h1>The only roles <em>every</em> business needs
    are decision-makers and analysts. If you lose your analysts, who will help you
    figure out which problems are worth solving?</h1></blockquote><p>If you overemphasize
    hiring and rewarding skills in machine learning and statistics, you’ll lose your
    <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_roles">analysts</a>. Who will help you figure
    out which problems are worth solving then? You’ll be left with a group of miserable
    experts who keep being asked to work on worthless projects or analytics tasks
    they didn’t sign up for. Your data will lie around useless.</p><h3>Care and feeding
    of researchers</h3><p>If this doesn’t sound bad enough, many leaders try to hire
    PhDs and overemphasize <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_roles">*research</a>* —
    as opposed to applied — versions of the statistician and ML engineer… without
    having a problem that is valuable, important, and known to be impossible to solve
    with all the existing algorithms out there.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*JIagAaLFqLkFnS_J"
    alt=""></p><p>That’s only okay if you’re investing in a <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_roles">research
    division</a> and you’re not planning to ask your researchers what they’ve done
    for you lately. <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_fail">Research for research’s
    sake</a> is a high-risk investment and very few companies can afford it, because
    getting nothing of value out of it is a very real possibility.</p><p>Researchers
    only belong outside of a research division if you have appropriate problems for
    them to solve — their skillset is creating new algorithms and tests from scratch
    where an off-the-shelf version doesn’t exist — otherwise they’ll experience a
    bleak Sisyphean spiral (which would be entirely your fault, not theirs). Researchers
    typically spend over a decade in training, which merits at least the respect of
    not being put to work on completely irrelevant tasks.</p><blockquote><h1>When
    in doubt, hire analysts before other <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_roles">roles</a>.</h1></blockquote><p>As
    a result, the right time to hire them to an applied project tends to be after
    your analysts helped you identify a valuable project and attempts to complete
    it with applied data scientists have already failed. <em>That’s</em> when you
    bring on the professional inventors.</p><h3>The punchline</h3><p>When in doubt,
    hire analysts before other <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_roles">roles</a>. Appreciate
    them and reward them. Encourage them to grow to the heights of their chosen career
    (and not someone else’s). Of the cast of characters mentioned in this story, the
    only ones <em>every</em> business with data needs are <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_dmleaders">decision-makers</a>
    and analysts. The others you’ll only be able to use when you know exactly what
    you need them for. Start with analytics and be proud of your newfound ability
    to open your eyes to the rich and beautiful information in front of you. <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_damnedlies">Inspiration</a>
    is a powerful thing and not to be sniffed at.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/0*FGjtkMyHYPxjfZPX.jpg"

  :title: A Cognitive Sciences Reading List for Designers
  :content: '<p>If you’ve ever done any contextual inquiry or usability testing, you’ve
    probably observed first hand the difference between what people say they will
    do and what they actually end up doing. Overlooked calls to action, bizarre navigation
    paths, mind-bogglingly irrational decisions — even the most sensible seeming users
    occasionally (or often) do things that “rationally” make little sense.</p><p>Which
    is to say that we all, on occasion (or often) do things that seem to make little
    rational sense.</p><p>And yet, on a day-to-day basis, this is how we successfully
    negotiate the complexities of our world. We use heuristics (aka rules-of-thumb)
    and limited information to make decisions about how we live our lives, and we
    do it continuously throughout the day — often without stopping to consider why
    we choose one thing over another.</p><p>In order to get a better sense of how
    our often erratic decision making processes work behind the scenes — and better
    understand why they sometimes don’t — I’ve been doing more reading lately into
    cognitive science and decision making. This post is a quick roundup of the books
    I’ve found most enlightening to the task of designing information systems for
    messy, irrational humans.</p><h2>Embodied &amp; Distributed Cognition</h2><p>There’s
    been a lot of attention given lately to the idea that “thinking” doesn’t take
    place solely in the space between our ears. Modern notions of cognition understand
    thinking as a process that crosses into the body and spills out into the world.
    For a deeper understanding of how thinking is embodied and distributed, these
    texts are a good place to start:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*jaG895C0vDDF3CnROut6CA.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><h3>Beyond the Brain</h3><p>Louise Barrett, 2011</p><p><strong>Theme</strong></p><p>It
    is an error to assume that complex behavior and complex cognition are necessarily
    linked and that the one can only arise from the other. By understanding how brains,
    bodies, and environment are connected, we can better understand how intelligent,
    adaptive behavior is produced.</p><p><strong>Key Concepts</strong></p><ul><li><p>“To
    make a distinction between perception and cognition as separate psychological
    processes is both arbitrary and false” (22).</p></li><li><p>“Language is not purely
    for communicating, but is also a way of effecting changes in our environment that
    enable us to achieve more than we could otherwise” (194).</p></li><li><p>“The
    real ‘problem solving machine’ is not the brain alone, but the brain, the body,
    and the environmental structures that we use to augment, enhance, and support
    internal cognitive processes” (219).</p></li></ul><p><strong>Impressions</strong></p><p>Very
    readable with lots of relatable examples and relevant context. This book draws
    on and furthers a wide body of foundational work (Andy Clark figures in here a
    lot — we’ll get to him in a minute), but remains accessible to a general audience.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*dYY45cA1H5lKEsl-CHNBSQ.jpeg" alt=""></p><h3>Proust
    and the Squid</h3><p>Maryanne Wolf, 2007</p><p><strong>Theme</strong></p><p>The
    process of learning to read creates physical changes in the brain that directly
    affect how that brain works and how we think. Understanding this process (neuroplasticity)
    in the reading brain prepares us to better understand the changes we’re currently
    undergoing as we “make the transition from a reading brain to an increasingly
    digital one.”</p><p><strong>Key Concepts</strong></p><ul><li><p>The efficient
    reading brain — which takes years to develop — literally has “more time to think”
    (54).</p></li><li><p>Contrary to spoken language, “there are neither genes nor
    biological structures specific only to reading. Instead, in order to read, each
    brain must learn to make new circuits by connecting older regions originally designed
    and genetically programmed for other things” (168).</p></li><li><p>“The new circuits
    and pathways that the brain fashions in order to read become the foundations for
    being able to think in different, innovative ways” (271).</p></li></ul><p><strong>Impressions</strong></p><p>The
    first part of this book focuses on the plasticity of the brain and the ways that
    learning to read changes it. Wolf illustrates this story with historical accounts
    of writing in early societies and plenty of good ol’ neuroscience. Later chapters
    focus more closely on reading development in children and dyslexia before returning
    in a brief final chapter to the effects of digital technology on how our brains
    work.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*F9mBeRyObEa7ASBCvd4RmA.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><h3>Supersizing the Mind</h3><p>Andy Clark, 2008</p><p><strong>Theme</strong></p><p>What
    we call “thinking” often occurs only partially in the brain: much of the human
    cognitive process regularly criss-crosses the boundaries of brain, body, and environment.
    “In building our physical and social worlds, we build (or rather, we massively
    reconfigure) our minds and our capacities of thought and reason” (xxviii).</p><p><strong>Key
    Concepts</strong></p><ul><li><p>“Words and linguistic strings are among the most
    powerful and basic tools we use to discipline and stabilize dynamic processes
    of reason and recall” (53).</p></li><li><p>“Gesture and speech are interacting
    parts of a distributed, semianarchic cognitive engine, participating in cognitively
    potent self-stimulating loops whose activity is as much an aspect of our thinking
    as its result” (133).</p></li><li><p>“The presence of humanlike minds depends
    quite directly on the possession of a humanlike body” (200).</p></li></ul><p><strong>Impressions</strong></p><p>Clark
    makes a compelling and provocative case for radically rethinking the way human
    beings perceive, think, and act in the world; for him, all of these actions are
    part of a single, continuous process. Clark supports his claim by drawing on a
    wide range of sources in linguistics, robotics, biology, and neuroscience — from
    which he pulls a variety anecdotes and examples that keep the text humming along.
    Big ideas here and intense reading; well worth the effort.</p><h2>Meaning Making</h2><p>Ferdinand
    de Saussure, the founder of linguistics, argued that without language, we wouldn’t
    have thought. Figuring out how we make meaning has lot to do with how we use and
    manipulate symbols. This field is plenty deep, but these titles will give you
    some practical ways to think about how “saying” and “meaning” relate:</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*xa4UNttCgpvMyF6bOyIPZg.jpeg" alt=""></p><h3>Metaphors
    We Live By</h3><p>George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, 1980</p><p><strong>Theme</strong></p><p>We
    have all at one time been taught to recognize a “metaphor” as a figure of speech,
    a particular use of language. Lakoff and Johnson argue that, to the contrary,
    metaphor as a linguistic expression is possible only because the human conceptual
    system and thought process is, at its core, metaphorically defined.</p><p><strong>Key
    Concepts</strong></p><ul><li><p>“Our values are not independent but must form
    a coherent system with the metaphorical concepts we live by” (22).</p></li><li><p>Even
    seemingly literal expressions are often structured by metaphorical concepts which
    highlight some aspects of experience while hiding others (51, 149).</p></li><li><p>Since
    truth is always relative to a conceptual system, and since any human conceptual
    system is mostly metaphorical in nature, there can be no fully objective, unconditional,
    or absolute truth (185).</p></li></ul><p><strong>Impressions</strong></p><p>This
    book is a great first foray into the subtleties of how we use language and metaphor
    to construct meaning and make sense of the world. Lakoff and Johnson drive the
    narrative with examples out of everyday language and take the time to thoroughly
    explain their conclusions. This book is definitely one of my favs.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*M-htoEcz-dcR3OgkLxzAfw.jpeg" alt=""></p><h3>Seeing
    What Others Don’t</h3><p>Gary Klein, 2013</p><p><strong>Theme</strong></p><p>Insight
    is not the result of concentration or a proven process, but rather of learning
    to “restructure beliefs.” To nurture the power of insight, we must change the
    story we use to understand events.</p><p><strong>Key Concepts</strong></p><ul><li><p>“Intuition
    is the use of patterns we’ve already learned, whereas insight is the discovery
    of new patterns” (27).</p></li><li><p>“Insights change our understanding by shifting
    the central beliefs — the anchors — in the story we use to make sense of events”
    (148).</p></li><li><p>“Confusions, contradictions, and conflicts can work as springboards
    to insight. We just have to replace our feelings of consternation with curiosity”
    (182).</p></li></ul><p><strong>Impressions</strong></p><p>Klein’s book is the
    record of his own quest to figure out what sparks insight — and to figure out
    what keeps us from grasping insight that is right in front of us. He explores
    these questions, as well as the question of how to increase the flow of insight,
    across scores of stories of insight achieved (and missed). Very readable, very
    engaging.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*RQyvn1i5QPSQjU4WUHjYNQ.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><h3>The Way We Think</h3><p>Gilles Fauconnier with Mark Turner, 2003</p><p><strong>Theme</strong></p><p>Identity,
    integration, and imagination are the result of the uniquely human ability to “blend”
    mental spaces by projecting elements from one frame of reference to another. This
    “cognitive blending” is the core process behind the human power to construct meaning.</p><p><strong>Key
    Concepts</strong></p><ul><li><p>“Meaning systems and formal systems are inseparable.
    They co-evolve in the species, the culture, and the individual” (11).</p></li><li><p>“The
    meanings we take most for granted are those where the complexity is best hidden”
    (24).</p></li><li><p>“Language does not represent meaning directly; instead, it
    systematically prompts the construction of meaning” (142).</p></li></ul><p><strong>Impressions</strong></p><p>The
    Way We Think provides one of the most meticulous, in depth readings of how humans
    construct meaning I have ever read. The examples given range from “Eureka!” moments,
    where we are shown the core inner workings of sudden realization and certainty,
    to constructions of the most banal everyday speech, revealed to contain complex
    operations of imaginative blending and synthesis. A less patient reader may find
    some of the case studies tedious, but the core framework and analytical approach
    offered here provides a powerful set of tools for digging deep into how we construct
    and communicate meaning.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*itI5_Kd-ggdfGA5OTCf-jQ.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><h3>Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things</h3><p>George Lakoff, 1990</p><p><strong>Theme</strong></p><p>We
    organize knowledge by means of structures called “idealized cognitive models,”
    which account for our ability to categorize and conceptualize. These models emerge
    from the basic, experiential aspects of human psychology: “gestalt perception,
    mental imagery, motor activities, social function, and memory” (37).</p><p><strong>Key
    Concepts</strong></p><ul><li><p>“Motivation depends on overall characteristics
    of the conceptual system, not just local characteristics of the category at hand”
    (113).</p></li><li><p>“Since we act in accord with our conceptual systems and
    since our actions are real, our conceptual systems have a major role in creating
    reality” (296).</p></li><li><p>“Reason is embodied in the sense that the very
    structures on which reason is based emerge from our bodily experience. Reason
    is imaginative in the sense that it makes use of metonymies, metaphors, and a
    wide variety of image schemas” (368).</p></li></ul><p><strong>Impressions</strong></p><p>“Women,
    Fire, and Dangerous Things” is the 500 ton locomotive of this list — and it doesn’t
    come with brakes. This is a big book full of big ideas, some of which you’ll follow,
    some of which you likely won’t. Don’t worry about it. Success means grappling
    with it, not defeating it. That said, there is a lot in here for the diligent
    reader. I’m particularly fond of chapter 17, “Cognitive Semantics.”</p><h2>Decision
    Making</h2><p>You’re a rational person, right? You make rational decisions, right?
    Alas, this is what everyone thinks — and we collectively have pretty varied opinions
    (to say the least) about what counts as “rational.” Dig these books to get some
    insight into why:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*7yWkKWe5Y8rfvFypbZQ2SA.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><h3>Predictably Irrational</h3><p>Dan Ariely, 2008</p><p><strong>Theme</strong></p><p>Standard
    economic theory suggests that individuals make decisions based on carefully weighed
    consideration of their options. In practice, however, “rationality” is regularly
    eclipsed by our irrational feelings about initial states (anchors), the temptation
    of getting anything for free, social norms, and the outsized value we place on
    what we already possess (loss aversion).</p><p><strong>Key Concepts</strong></p><ul><li><p>“Once
    prices are established in our minds — even if they’re arbitrary — they shape not
    only what we are willing to pay for an item, but also how much we are willing
    to pay for related products” (32).</p></li><li><p>“The difference between two
    cents and one cent is small; the difference between once cent and zero is huge”
    (68).</p></li><li><p>“Our propensity to overvalue what we own is a basic human
    bias, and it reflects a more general tendency to fall in love with, and be overly
    optimistic about, anything that has to do with ourselves” (182).</p></li></ul><p><strong>Impressions</strong></p><p>This
    is one of the most accessible texts on this list: Ariely writes in an easy-going,
    conversational style and structures all of his arguments around closely focused,
    often funny studies and experiments he has himself conducted with students and
    colleagues. His examples are great both at illustrating his points and keeping
    his reader engaged.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*PYxi8Li5v3BNB1OpkQx0GQ.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><h3>Thinking, Fast and Slow</h3><p>Daniel Kahneman, 2011</p><p><strong>Theme</strong></p><p>We
    use two cognitive processes to evaluate information: a fast, always-on, but error-prone
    automatic system, and a more effective, analytical but effortful deliberate system.
    The trouble we get into is that we sometimes mistake automatic and error-prone
    decisions for well-considered, analytical ones — sometimes to the point of consciously
    making decisions that are opposed to our best interests.</p><p><strong>Key Concepts</strong></p><ul><li><p>Why
    we fail at statistics: “our mind is strongly biased toward causal explanations
    and does not deal well with ‘mere statistics.’ When our attention is called to
    an event, associative memory will look for its cause — more precisely, activation
    will automatically spread to any cause that is already stored in memory” (182).</p></li><li><p>What
    You See is All There Is (WYSIATI): “You cannot help dealing with the limited information
    you have as if it were all there is to know. You build the best possible story
    from the information available to you, and if it is a good story, you believe
    it. Paradoxically, it is easier to construct a coherent story when you know little,
    when there are fewer pieces to fit into the puzzle. Our comforting conviction
    that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited
    ability to ignore our ignorance” (201).</p></li><li><p>In misunderstanding statistical
    possibility, we end up paying a premium (sometimes an exorbitant one) for security
    from unlikely events, while at the same time gambling resources regularly on equally
    unlikely events. Chapter 29 (and much of the book, really).</p></li></ul><p><strong>Impressions</strong></p><p>This
    book is a fascinating and compelling read. Kahneman’s examples are clear and easy
    to follow — and their implications are sobering (if not terrifying). I’ve talked
    to a lot of folks who have started this book, but never quite finished it. At
    400 + pages, it’s a bit longer than some other texts on this list, but I definitely
    recommend reading it all the way to the end — it’s all good stuff, especially
    if you’re trying to understand why people (perhaps including yourself) make the
    decisions they do in the face of uncertain outcomes.</p><h2>And There You Have
    It</h2><p>Now: I’m not going to claim that this list isn’t challenging, or that
    you should be able to knock these out in a couple weekends. If you’re interested
    in digging into the prickly problems of designing for the complex systems that
    crop up when we mix data, choice, and the human decision-making process, though,
    these books will give you plenty to think about.</p><p>Even more than that, all
    of them should give you additional frames of reference from which to consider
    the messy, human challenges we face as designers every day. Principles like Daniel
    Kahnemman’s “What You See Is All There Is” or Fauconnier &amp; Turner’s “cognitive
    blending” will give you new ways to pop your thinking out of the “best practices”
    ruts you might have fallen into and look for solutions to messy human problems
    in the very behavior of messy humans themselves.</p><h2>Bonus Paragraph: How to
    Read!</h2><p>You, of course, know how to read. I get that. But reading work by
    professional research scholars — even books intended for a popular audience, as
    are many of these — is a bit different from reading professional or trade publications.
    As a grad student (in English, during which time I read <em>a lot</em>), I developed
    some habits to help me better understand, retain, synthesize, and be able to recall
    texts like these. Here’s what worked for me:</p><p><strong>1. Buy a Book</strong></p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*dmbmiRdo6bY5flE6TDpMaw.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>If
    I’m going to read a book like one of those listed here, I want a paper copy I
    can write in and (slightly) abuse. The point of a physical book for me is to be
    able to read it actively: underline, highlight, star passages, dog-ear corners,
    make notes. Reading actively helps you 1) integrate what you’re reading and synthesize
    it with the other ideas jumbling around in your head and 2) come back to this
    text weeks, months, or years later and quickly find the ideas and passages that
    piqued your interest.</p><p><strong>2. Buy a Pencil</strong></p><p>Leave it in
    the book. If you don’t have a pencil, you won’t take notes and you won’t annotate.
    You’ll read passively. Set yourself up to be an active, physically engaged reader.
    I like a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zebras-Zebra-Mechanical-Pencil-51391/dp/B001BZ4RJS">mechanical
    pencil like these</a> because they’re cheap, always sharp, fit well in a book,
    and allow me to write satanically tiny notes.</p><p><strong>3. Steal a Sheet of
    Paper</strong></p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*rC_Z37Bjr67yEiQczpQ1EQ.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>Cut it in half, then fold one of your halves in half to make a booklet.
    Jot down the ideas and passages that stand out. I include page numbers so I can
    easily find passages later on. You’ll have to write small — and you’ll have to
    be selective about what you record (which is a good thing: too much note taking
    will slow you way down). Leave your notes in the book. Now when you come back
    and look for that idea or passage later, you’ll have both your annotations and
    a quick reference guide to the passages you personally found most intriguing.</p><hr><p><em>This

  :title: The arts are a more secure career than the sciences — here’s the proof.
  :content: '<p>Since releasing my book Real Artists Don’t Starve, I’ve heard from
    a number of people who don’t believe it’s possible to make a living off your creativity,
    whether in writing, fine art, or another medium.</p><p>But is that really true?</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*CTmOh-D5oapZqpeP.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>For
    most of my life, I was told a story about what it means to be an <em>artist</em>,
    a title reserved for that elite group of people who were talented but unlikely
    to succeed.</p><p>The advice was always the same:</p><ul><li><p><em>Don’t quit
    your day job.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Do this while you’re young</em>.</p></li><li><p><em>Always
    have something to fall back on.</em></p></li></ul><p>When I was growing up, I
    was told that creativity, though a nice outlet, was never something you should
    go “all in” on. Because, odds are, you’ll starve. You may have been told the same.</p><p>It
    turns out, though, that’s just not true.</p><h2>Real artists don’t starve</h2><p>For
    years, the <a href="http://snaap.indiana.edu/">Strategic National Arts Alumni
    Project</a> (SNAAP) has been surveying graduates of arts programs to see how successful
    they are in the real world.</p><p>Approximately 120,000 degrees in the arts are
    awarded every year, and the question is, what happens to these people? Not what
    you think.</p><p>You might imagine, as I did, the stereotypical starving artist:
    the stubborn loner struggling to make ends meet and forsaking every adult concern
    for the sake of their work.</p><p>This is what we have been taught to expect when
    imagining people in full-time, creative careers. We imagine poverty-stricken souls
    spending their days slaving away at the work, toiling in agony to create their
    next masterpiece.</p><p>We picture Michelangelo on his back, nose to ceiling,
    paint dripping in his eyes, earning little for his genius.</p><p>The SNAAP study,
    however, revealed something quite different. The majority of trained artists are
    actually thriving. Here were some fascinating statistics:</p><ul><li><p>70% of
    these graduates have found jobs within the arts,</p></li><li><p>75% have been
    or are self-employed,</p></li><li><p>99% consider creativity to be an important
    competency in their profession, and</p></li></ul><p>They report income levels
    that support families, sustain careers, and enable charitable giving. In other
    words, <em>they are not starving</em>.</p><p>Contrast that with a 2014 US Census
    Bureau where nearly 75 percent of science, tech, engineering, and mathematics
    graduates are not employed in their field of study, and we are forced to consider
    a new reality for modern creatives.</p><p>Many artists are, in fact, not suffering
    for their craft. They’re proudly producing work that matters and pays the bills.
    So, we are brought to a sobering conclusion about creative work:</p><p><strong>You
    can make art <em>and</em> make a living.</strong></p><h2>You don’t have to suffer
    to create</h2><p>Over the past couple years, while writing <a href="http://amzn.to/2nhRAH4">*Real
    Artists Don’t Starve</a>*, I interviewed hundreds of working creatives and came
    across a surprising fact.</p><p>When we look at the lives of successful artists,
    writers, and entrepreneurs, we see a unique mindset:</p><p>They don’t believe
    they have to suffer to succeed.</p><p>These people, those I call Thriving Artists,
    think about themselves and their work differently than those who don’t succeed.
    Discarding the ways of the Starving Artist, they follow a new set of rules, what
    I call The Rules of the New Renaissance.</p><p>Here they are, all 12 of them:</p><blockquote><h1>The
    starving artist believes you must be born an artist.</h1><h1>The thriving artist
    believes you become an artist.</h1><h1>The starving artist waits for inspiration.</h1><h1>The
    thriving artist steals from his influences.</h1><h1>The starving artist believes
    he has enough talent.</h1><h1>The thriving artist apprentices under a master.</h1><h1>The
    starving artist is stubborn about everything.</h1><h1>The thriving artist is flexible
    on details but stubborn on vision.</h1><h1>The starving artist waits to be noticed.</h1><h1>The
    thriving artist finds patrons.</h1><h1>The starving artist believes he can be
    creative anywhere.</h1><h1>The thriving artists goes where creative work is already
    happening.</h1><h1>The starving artist needs no one.</h1><h1>The thriving artist
    builds a network.</h1><h1>The starving artist always works alone.</h1><h1>The
    thriving artist collaborates with others.</h1><h1>The starving artist does his
    work in private.</h1><h1>The thriving artist shares his work, practicing in public.</h1><h1>The
    starving artist is a risk-taker.</h1><h1>The thriving artist takes the right risks.</h1><h1>The
    starving artist works for free.</h1><h1>The thriving artist always works for something.</h1><h1>The
    starving artist sells his work to the earliest bidder.</h1><h1>The thriving artist
    owns his work until it’s time to sell out.</h1><h1>The starving artist does one
    thing.</h1><h1>The thriving artist does many things.</h1><h1>The starving artist
    despises the need for money.</h1><h1>The thriving artist makes money to make more
    art.</h1></blockquote><h2>Find a way to live off your art</h2><p>These are the
    things nobody told me — as a kid drawing cartoons, a teenager playing the guitar,
    and a twenty-something dreaming of writing books.</p><p>In my book, I share story
    after story of Thriving Artists who didn’t suffer for their work but instead found
    a way to live off it.</p><p>And if we follow in their footsteps, adopting the
    rules by which they live their lives, we can do the same.</p><p>To learn more

  :title: 100 Days of Motion Design
  :content: "<p>How I taught myself to create 50 pieces of animation in 100 days</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2036/1*3_kKCF98Ili-FN1QyOu30w.gif\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>It was a summer night in Seattle. I ate some ice-cream, watched
    a Youtube tutorial, and downloaded a free trial of Principle. Several months later,
    I completed my 5th 100-day-project — 100 Days of Motion.</p><p>I started my first
    100-day-project back in 2015. My past projects include 100 Days of Doodle, 100
    Days of Lettering, 100 Days of Watercolor, and 100 Days of Vector Illustration.</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Tw0bHzYV8NQ8FzJh0caoLg.png\"
    alt=\"My Past 100-Day-Projects\"><em>My Past 100-Day-Projects</em></p><p>For me,
    100-day-project is a creative outlet. It allows me to express myself through art.
    The joy of creation and the challenge of learning a new craft always keeps me
    coming back for more.</p><p>In 100 Days of Motion Design, I taught myself to animate
    and created 50 pieces of vector-based animation in 100 days. You can find all
    of them on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/100daysofmotionbytx/\">Instagram</a>
    and <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/tiantianxu/tags/100daysofmotion\">Dribbble</a>.</p><p>Here
    is my creative process, the tools I used, and a reflection on the project.</p><h2>Tools</h2><h3>Sketch
    + Principle</h3><p>During the first two weeks, I illustrated in Sketch and then
    imported it into Principle for animation.</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.sketchapp.com/\">**Sketch</a>:**
    A lightweight vector editing tool that is intuitive and affordable. I find it
    a handy tool to create simple illustrations.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"http://principleformac.com/\">**Principle</a>:**
    A lightweight prototyping tool that generates interactive animation. It works
    with Sketch seamlessly. I find it a good tool for beginners to learn animation
    properties and the timeline concept.</p></li></ul><h3>Illustrator + After Effects</h3><p>After
    the first two weeks, I switched to Illustrator and After Effects for more advanced
    control.</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html?sdid=KKQML&mv=search&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!227016237331!e!!g!!illustrator&ef_id=WNC7nwAAAKHjtx@A:20180807020959:s\">**Illustrator</a>:**
    The most powerful vector editing tool. The illustration created in Illustrator
    can be imported into After Effects seamlessly.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html\">**After
    Effects</a>:** The most powerful animation tool. It has a steep learning curve.
    Throughout the project, I have learned to use many of its advanced controls and
    built-in visual effects.</p></li></ul><h2>Creative Process</h2><p>Creating animation
    is time-consuming. I broke the creative process down into four steps and aimed
    to complete them in two days.</p><h3>Step 1: Look for inspiration (15 mins)</h3><p>I
    collect motion design inspiration from Dribbble, Behance, and Instagram on a daily
    basis. My <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/tiantianxu/ui-motion/\">growing
    Pinterest board</a> has been my go-to place for inspiration.</p><p>I also collect
    motion design tutorials on Youtube. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2qWmlVFdcGNrUdd-agegZo-7GFBmgKOu\">Here
    is a list of tutorials</a> I have used throughout my 100-day-project.</p><h3>Step
    2: Sketch ideas (5 mins)</h3><p>Once I had an idea, I sketched its key movements
    on my notebook.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Um8uWFp_Zzs43LaOH34E8w.png\"
    alt=\"Sketch Ideas\"><em>Sketch Ideas</em></p><h3>Step 3: Create illustration
    (40 mins)</h3><p>I created the illustration and imported it into Principle or
    After Effects. Keeping the design file well-organized can significantly speed
    up the importation.</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/yPha_s7W-0M\">This tutorial</a>
    shows how to prepare and import an Illustrator file into After Effects. Alternatively,
    the <a href=\"https://google.github.io/sketch2ae/\">Sketch2AE</a> plugin can import
    Sketch layers into After Effects.</p><h3>Step 4: Create animation (60 mins)</h3><p>I
    animated the illustration and exported the final animation as a short video. I
    posted the video to Instagram with the hashtag #100daysofmotionbytx</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/jHpk1JS44yE\">This
    tutorial</a> shows how to export a video to GIF if you want to post animations
    to Dribbble.</p><h2>Day 1–14: Start with the basics</h2><p>I created my first
    animation by watching <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qYCPoqwmQK4\">Principle—Simple
    Character Animation (Jumping Donut</a>).</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*qxVO9pb3XK8Ua7xW03zF3w.gif\"
    alt=\"100 Days of Motion—Jumping Donut\"><em>100 Days of Motion—Jumping Donut</em></p><p>I
    created an interactive prototype by following <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iS3B5VT7Ejc\">Principle

    alt=\"100 Days of Motion — Jake and Pizza\"><em>100 Days of Motion — Jake and

    alt=\"100 Days of Motion—Solar Eclipse\"><em>100 Days of Motion—Solar Eclipse</em></p><h2>Day
    15–70: Climb the learning curve</h2><p>During day 15–70, I developed the following
    methods to climb the learning curve of After Effects.</p><h3>Method 1: Watch tutorial
    and create from memory</h3><p>I watched the video tutorial in 1.5x speed and tried
    to create the animation from memory.</p><p>When necessary I wrote down the key
    steps and only revisited the tutorial if I felt stuck. I also made an effort to
    memorize the common After Effects shortcuts to help speed up the process.</p><p>I
    created the smoke effect after watching <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mYf1wElfPn4\">Smoke
    Animation — After Effects Tutorial</a>.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*M91MIdQGKJ4-EnOjkqll6A.gif\"

    alt=\"100 Days of Motion—Lava Lamp\"><em>100 Days of Motion—Lava Lamp</em></p><h3>Method
    2: Rebound other people’s work</h3><p>I studied other people’s work on Dribbble
    frame by frame and then came up with my own idea.</p><p>I rebounded <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/2542570-Bouncy-Fruits\">Bouncy
    Fruits</a> by Deekay. I deconstructed his work to study the “Squash and Stretch”
    animation principle.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*smPzqyHsAoGBMU6YFpKlQQ.gif\"
    alt=\"100 Days of Motion — Bouncy Desserts\"><em>100 Days of Motion — Bouncy Desserts</em></p><p>I
    rebounded <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/3631324-Walk-Cycle-Tutorial\">Ducky
    Walk Cycle</a> by Tony Babel. His tutorial <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PgBo-00_GWc\">After
    Effects—Walk Cycle Tutorial</a> taught me how to animate walk cycles. (The character
    was inspired by a doodle from <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/skinnyandy/\">Skinny
    Andy</a>.)</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*7RcOznQuK8dh8Nl0IFb0MA.gif\"
    alt=\"100 Days of Motion — Mr. Teacup\"><em>100 Days of Motion — Mr. Teacup</em></p><h3>Method
    3: Re-apply learned skills intentionally</h3><p>Repetition is the key to reinforce
    a newly learned skill. I intentionally re-applied the skills I learned to create
    new animation.</p><p>I created the bouncy pumpkin by re-applying the “Squash and
    Stretch” animation principle.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*IEZP_HYSBxuhzIeX9GGzaQ.gif\"

    alt=\"100 Days of Motion—Flamingo\"><em>100 Days of Motion—Flamingo</em></p><h3>Method
    4: Read book to connect the dots</h3><p>Halfway through the 100-day-project, I
    took a day to read <Adobe After Effects CC Classroom in a Book>. I was able to
    connect the dots by revisiting the learned skills in a more systematic way. I
    also discovered new techniques that I wanted to try.<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Adobe-After-Effects-Classroom-release/dp/0134853253/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=BPGEAWD0RMT4VRVJS98N\"><strong>Adobe

  :title: Big Data, Machine Learning, and the Social Sciences
  :content: '<p>This essay is a (near) transcript of a talk I recently gave at a NIPS
    2014 workshop on “Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning,”
    organized by Solon Barocas and Moritz Hardt.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>I want
    to start by giving you some context for this talk by telling you a little bit
    about <a href="http://dirichlet.net/about/">me and my background</a>: I’m a machine
    learning researcher by training. That said, I wouldn’t describe my research over
    the past few years as being traditional machine learning. Instead, most of my
    recent research has been in the emerging field of computational social science
    — that is, the development and use of computational and statistical techniques
    to study social processes. This shift in research direction has given me an opportunity
    to start thinking outside the algorithmic boxes typically embraced by the machine
    learning community and instead focus on the opportunities, challenges, and implications
    involved developing and using machine learning methods to analyze real-world data
    about society.</p><p>Outside of my research life, I’ve also spent the past 15
    years contributing to the free and open source software community and working
    to promote and support women in computing. These activities, and their focus on
    transparency, openness, fairness, and inclusion, have influenced my perspective
    on the issues surrounding today’s workshop, and I’m excited to be speaking here
    because it’s given me an opportunity to tie together some of my thoughts on these
    ideas and their relationship to machine learning.</p><p>We have a really interesting
    group of <a href="http://fatml.org/speakers.html">people</a> here today, with
    very diverse backgrounds, and I’m looking forward to seeing what comes out of
    their interactions. As a result, this talk will be structured around four talking
    points — intended to prompt discussion — that lie at the heart of fairness, accountability,
    and transparency in machine learning:</p><ul><li><p>Data</p></li><li><p>Questions</p></li><li><p>Models</p></li><li><p>Findings</p></li></ul><h2>Data</h2><p>Since
    the primary impetus for this workshop was President Obama’s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/technology/big-data-review">ninety-day
    review of big data</a>, I want to start by talking about a couple of definitional
    issues surrounding big data and its common uses.</p><blockquote><h1>What is big
    data?</h1></blockquote><p>For something so spectacularly pervasive and trendy,
    I’ve heard this question surprisingly often. Initially, I thought this was because
    no one knew (or at least agreed upon) the answer. For example, <a href="http://nsf.gov/">NSF</a>
    and <a href="http://nih.gov/">NIH </a>— two of the largest funders of academic
    research on big data — gave the following definition in their <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12499/nsf12499.htm">2012
    joint program solicitation</a>:<center><em>‘[B]ig data’ […] refers to large, diverse,
    complex, longitudinal, and/or distributed data sets generated from instruments,
    sensors, Internet transactions, email, video, click streams, and/or all other
    digital sources available[.]</em></center></p><p>Meanwhile, other organizations
    refer to Gartner, Inc.’s <a href="http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/big-data/">“3Vs”
    definition</a>:<center><em>‘Big data’ is high volume, high velocity and high variety
    information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information
    processing[.]</em></center></p><p>In this definition, volume refers to the amount
    of data in question, velocity refers to the speed with which that data can be
    obtained and/or processed, while variety refers to the range of different data
    types and sources.</p><p>Nowadays, I think the reason I hear this question so
    often is that some of the most salient properties of big data, as it’s commonly
    construed, make people very uncomfortable. Yet, these vague, catch-all definitions
    don’t highlight these disquieting properties. For example, there’s little in these
    definitions — especially Gartner’s — that distinguishes this “new” big data from
    the massive data sets arising in physics, for example. So why, then, are people
    so worried about big data but not about particle physics?</p><p>I think there
    are two reasons. The first is nicely captured in this alternative definition of
    big data from a recent <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/181773/big-data-actually-reinforcing-social-inequalities">article</a>
    by Michelle Chen:<center><em>‘Big data’ [is] the amassing of huge amounts of statistical
    information on social and economic trends and human behavior.</em></center></p><p>In
    other words, unlike the data sets arising in physics, the data sets that typically
    fall under the big data umbrella are about <em>people *— their attributes, their
    preferences, their actions, and their interactions. That is to say, these are
    *social</em> data sets that document people’s behaviors in their everyday lives.</p><p>The
    second reason is highlighted by this quote from <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Ejordan/">Michael
    Jordan</a>, a machine learning researcher, taken from a recent talk of his:<center><em>The
    issue is not just size—we’ve always had big data sets — the issue is granularity.</em></center></p><p>In
    other words, not only do these data sets document social phenomena, they do so
    at the granularity of <em>individual</em> people and their activities.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XPc_c6e794KrsJFY229sgQ.png" alt=""></p><p>So
    why, then, does <em>granular, social data</em> make people uncomfortable? Well,
    ultimately—and at the risk of stating the obvious—it’s because data of this sort
    brings up issues regarding ethics, privacy, bias, fairness, and inclusion. In
    turn, these <em>issues</em> make people uncomfortable because, at least as the
    popular narrative goes, these are <em>new</em> issues that fall outside the expertise
    of those those aggregating and analyzing big data. But the thing is, these issues
    aren’t actually new. Sure, they may be new to computer scientists and software
    engineers, but they’re not new to social scientists.</p><p>This is why I think
    the world of big data and those working in it — ranging from the machine learning
    researchers developing new analysis tools all the way up to the end-users and
    decision-makers in government and industry — can learn something from computational
    social science.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*NXg7uteutr5a4kyud_7Ndw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>One of the things I love most about working in computational social
    science is that, by definition, it’s an inherently interdisciplinary field, in
    which collaboration is necessary to make ground-breaking progress: social scientists
    provide vital context and insight regarding pertinent research questions, data
    sources, acquisition methods, and interpretations, while statisticians and computer
    scientists contribute expertise in developing mathematical models and computational
    tools. Granted, interdisciplinary collaboration is hard — for example, you have
    to establish a common language for communication — and it takes time — often more
    time than within-discipline collaborations — but, ultimately, it produces results
    that no discipline could have produced single-handedly. In fact, there’s research
    in social psychology and sociology indicating that rapid, breakthrough innovations
    are best facilitated by bringing together people with diverse backgrounds. When
    working in diverse groups, people behave differently — they are more likely to
    express different viewpoints and to emphasize diverse characteristics. In contrast,
    when working in homogeneous groups, people tend to overemphasize the qualities
    they share.</p><p>So, if technology companies and government organizations — the
    biggest players in the big data game — are going to take issues like bias, fairness,
    and inclusion seriously, they need to hire social scientists — the people with
    the best training in thinking about important societal issues. Moreover, it’s
    important that this hiring is done not just in a token, “hire one social scientist
    for every hundred computer scientists” kind of way, but in a serious, “creating
    interdisciplinary teams” kind of kind of way.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*AfxWk0AoJ17F5UofHP77Dg.png"
    alt="Thanks to Moritz Hardt for the picture!"><em>Thanks to Moritz Hardt for the
    picture!</em></p><p>While preparing for my talk, I read an article by <a href="http://www.moritzhardt.com/">Moritz
    Hardt</a>, entitled “<a href="https://medium.com/@mrtz/how-big-data-is-unfair-9aa544d739de">How
    Big Data is Unfair</a>.” In this article, Moritz notes that even in supposedly
    large data sets, there is always proportionally less data available about minorities.
    Moreover, statistical patterns that hold for the majority may be invalid for a
    given minority group. He gives, as an example, the task of classifying user names
    as “real” or “fake.” In one culture — comprising the majority of the training
    data — real names might be short and common, while in another they might be long
    and unique. As a result, the classic machine learning objective of “good performance
    on average,” may actually be detrimental to those in the minority group.</p><p>As
    another, more contrived, example, consider the following randomized algorithm
    for fairly distributing birthday cake between six people: roll a fair, six-sided
    die and give the entire cake to the winning person. On average, everyone gets
    1/6 of the cake, so, on average, the performance is fair; however, the probability
    that someone is unhappy is always one.</p><p>Within computer science, there’s
    a lot of enthusiasm about big data at the moment. This is unsurprising and completely
    reasonable: we finally have computing infrastructure that supports the storage
    and analysis of massive data sets. This makes for some really exciting computational
    opportunities. But when it comes to addressing bias, fairness, and inclusion,
    perhaps we need to focus our attention on the <em>granular</em> nature of big
    data, or the fact that there may be many interesting data sets, nested within
    these larger collections, for which average-case statistical patterns may not
    hold.</p><p>As a machine learning researcher, working in the social sciences,
    I think this is an exciting shift in perspective, and one that raises very different,
    but extremely compelling, computational challenges: For example, how can we build
    models for drawing accurate conclusions about heterogeneous data? Should we develop
    aggregate models, perhaps inspired by ensemble methods, that account separately
    for smaller, nested subsets of this data? Can we do so without violating ethics
    or privacy concerns? And, if so, how can we build accurate models for these diverse,
    nested subsets?</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Iwpi06r5Ed4CS2qtqX28Ag.png"
    alt=""></p><p>I don’t have any concrete answers to these questions. However, when
    thinking about the last one — building accurate and reliable models for diverse,
    nested data sets — perhaps we should again be drawing upon the experience of social
    scientists, who already have significant expertise in this area. It’s often the
    case that social scientists want to answer questions for which massive, homogeneous
    data sets just don’t exist: for instance, there are political scientists interested
    in the relationship between gender and US Supreme Court opinions — i.e., the opinions
    of just nine individuals, of which even fewer are female. Other social scientists
    have multiple data sets with very different emphases, which, when combined, reveal
    a much more complete picture of some underlying social process. For example, consider
    a publication and a patent describing the same piece of work. Although each is
    separately useful, together they form a richer view of technological innovation.
    Finally, many social scientists work with “artisanal data” — i.e., data sets that
    have been carefully selected, hand-labeled, or curated in some way by a small
    group of experts for some specific purpose.</p><p>With that, I’m going to move
    onto my second talking point — questions — but before I do so, I want to briefly
    summarize my take-home messages regarding data. First, we need to start explicitly
    stating that big data, at least as the term is commonly used, is actually <em>granular,
    social</em> data. Second, in order to responsibly articulate and address issues
    relating to bias, fairness, and inclusion, we need to stop thinking of big data
    sets as being homogeneous, and instead shift our focus to the many diverse data
    sets nested within these larger collections. Finally, addressing both of these
    points necessitates collaboration with social scientists.</p><h2>Questions</h2><p>With
    a sufficiently large data set, it can be relatively easy to pick out a coarse-grained
    signal from noise with even the simplest mathematical methods. Discovering finer-grained
    signals, however, such as those often associated with data about minorities, can
    be much harder. <a href="http://www.philosophyofinformation.net/">Luciano Floridi</a>,
    a philosopher, addresses this point in a recent <a href="http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13347-012-0093-4">paper</a>
    of his. He says,<center><em>The real, epistemological problem with big data is
    small patterns. […] [But] small patterns may be significant only if properly aggregated.
    So what we need is a better understanding of which data are worth preserving.</em></center></p><p>In
    other words, fine-grained patterns may not be readily visible using existing computational
    techniques. He continues,<center><em>And this is a matter of grasping which questions
    are or will be interesting. […] [T]he game will be won by those who ‘know how
    to ask and answer questions.’</em></center></p><p>Again, this underscores the
    need for social scientists, who are trained to ask and answer important questions
    about society; however, it also highlights one of my biggest concerns about some
    of the big data research and development coming out of the computer science community.</p><p>One
    of the most common driving forces behind big data research is the convenient availability
    of data sets. In other words, it’s common for researchers or developers to encounter
    a new data set and then structure their workflow — be it designing mathematical
    models or developing computational tools — around figuring out some way to use
    it. A related, but different, approach, is to create a new model or tool — a hammer
    — in order to solve some abstract problem and then search for data sets — nails
    — with which to showcase it. While conducive to fast-paced work, these “data-first”
    and “method-first” approaches can amplify issues relating to bias, fairness, and
    inclusion. First, it’s easy to immediately zone in on the coarse-grained patterns
    typically evidenced by the majority and then concentrate on analyzing those patterns
    instead of the fine-grained, harder-to-see patterns associated with minority groups.
    Second, it’s extremely common to focus on only those data sets that are readily
    available, such as Twitter. The problem with these “convenience” data sets is
    that they typically reflect only a particular, privileged segment of society —
    e.g., white, Americans or young people with smart phones. Consequently, many of
    the methods developed to analyze these data sets prioritize accurately modeling
    that majority over other segments of the population.</p><p>As an alternative,
    I would advocate prioritizing vital social questions over data availability —
    an approach more common in the social sciences. Moreover, if we’re prioritizing
    social questions, perhaps we should take this as an opportunity to prioritize
    those questions explicitly related to minorities and bias, fairness, and inclusion.
    Of course, putting questions first — especially questions about minorities, for
    whom there may not be much available data — means that we’ll need to go beyond
    standard convenience data sets and general-purpose “hammer” methods. Instead we’ll
    need to think hard about how best to instrument data aggregation and curation
    mechanisms that, when combined with precise, targeted models and tools, are capable
    of elucidating fine-grained, hard-to-see patterns.</p><p>As a concrete example,
    my political science collaborator <a href="http://people.umass.edu/bruced/">Bruce
    Desmarais </a>and I are currently studying the role of gender in local government
    organizations. This project is exciting for two reasons: First, there is very
    little data-driven work on government at the local level. Second, although there
    has been work in organizational science suggesting that women tend to occupy disadvantaged
    positions in organizational communication networks, this work mostly consists
    of individual- and firm-level case studies, rather than large-scale analysis of
    real-world data.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ega8_-7hNd16pXvX4-Vn8w.png"
    alt=""></p><p>At first glance, this might seem like a hard area to study using
    a data-driven approach — these are not the types of question readily answered
    using Twitter or Facebook data. However, over the past few years, many “open government”
    data sets have been made available to the public with the stated goal of transparency.
    These data sets are instances of what I call “push” transparency — that is, government
    organizations proactively facilitated their distribution. Unfortunately, for our
    research questions, even these data sets (or the ones that we could find) are
    insufficient. But, as it turns out, there are other transparency mechanisms for
    addressing social questions, especially those relating to government — what I
    call “pull” transparency mechanisms. These mechanisms can be used as an opportunity
    to move beyond convenience data sets and even to request data that explicitly
    relates to bias and fairness. For example, most US states have sunshine laws that
    mimic the federal Freedom of Information Act. These laws require local government
    organizations to archive textual records — including, in many states, email —
    and disclose them to the public upon request. As a result, it’s possible to obtain
    all kinds of local government data via public records requests, including data
    on bias, fairness, and inclusion. Of course, in order to do this, you have to
    know about these laws, how to issue a public records request, and so on and so
    on — all of which is arguably more difficult than pulling in data from the Twitter
    firehose, but may ultimately help address bigger societal issues.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*eMsBhGHV1yJu-ly_TWUKhw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>In our case, Bruce and I (and our students) ended up issuing public
    records requests to county governments in North Carolina, asking for county managers’
    email spanning a period of a few months. We’re now using this data to investigate
    whether women occupy disadvantaged positions in local government communication
    networks and, if so, the extent to which this varies with the topic of communication.</p><p>As
    another example of question-driven work that moves beyond readily available convenience
    data, I also want to briefly mention some really interesting <a href="http://www.nickdiakopoulos.com/projects/algorithmic-accountability-reporting/">research</a>
    being done by <a href="http://www.nickdiakopoulos.com/">Nick Diakopoulos</a> and
    others in the computational journalism community. Fueled by concerns that businesses
    and governments are amplifying their already considerable power by their use of
    opaque and often proprietary, automated, decision-making algorithms, increasing
    numbers of investigative journalists are using reverse engineering techniques
    to obtain data that they can then use to understand algorithmic decision-making.
    This line of work — known as “algorithmic accountability reporting” — serves as
    another example of choosing to focus on hard questions about bias, fairness, and
    inclusion — in this case, the nature and extent of biased algorithmic power structures
    — rather than the convenient availability of digital data sets.</p><p>To conclude
    this section, I want to summarize my take-home messages about questions. First,
    rather than engaging in data-first or model-first research and development, we
    should prioritize questions — especially questions about bias and fairness. Second,
    although taking a question-driven approach can be more challenging, in that standard
    convenience data sets may not be appropriate, collecting data that pertains to
    bias, fairness, and inclusion will ultimately better serve everyone’s needs.</p><h2>Models</h2><p>As
    I was writing this talk, I noticed that many of the models discussed in the literature
    about fairness and transparency in machine learning are <em>predictive</em> models.
    I found this emphasis on predictive models particularly interesting because of
    a disconnect that I kept encountering when I first started working in computational
    social science. Specifically, I kept overhearing conversations between computer
    scientists and social scientists that involved sentences like, “I don’t get it
    — why is that a research question?” And I couldn’t work out why. But then I found
    this <a href="http://gking.harvard.edu/files/words.pdf">quote</a> by <a href="http://gking.harvard.edu/">Gary
    King</a> and <a href="http://people.iq.harvard.edu/%7Edhopkins/">Daniel Hopkins</a>
    (both political scientists) that I think really captures the essence of this disconnect:<center><em>[C]omputer
    scientists may be interested in finding the needle in the haystack — such as […]
    the right web page to display from a search — but social scientists are more commonly
    interested in characterizing the haystack.</em></center></p><p>After reading this
    quote, I did some thinking about the different types of modeling tasks typically
    undertaken by computer scientists and social scientists and — roughly speaking
    — I think they fall into three categories.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*poi0q1yFcrp9QOR32dlnuA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The first is prediction. Prediction tasks are all about using observed
    data to make predictions about missing information or future, yet-to-be-observed
    data. These are “finding the needle” tasks — in general, it is computer scientists
    and decision-makers who are most interested in them. Commonly used predictive
    models include logistic regression, conditional random fields, naive Bayes, Gaussian
    processes, and support vector machines.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*DqqwWLNWbB7JD84UbmCaug.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The second is explanation. Here the focus is on “why” questions
    —in other words finding plausible or probable explanations for observed data.
    These explanations can then be compared with established social theories or previous
    findings. Explanation tasks are therefore “characterizing the haystack” tasks
    and, in general, it is social scientists who are most interested in them. I’m
    not going to say much about explanatory models today — in part because they’re
    somewhat outside my area of expertise.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*MwU4ecKQCmH0pFGS_Vy70Q.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Finally, there’s exploration. Exploration is all about uncovering
    patterns in observed data — usually patterns that we don’t already know about.
    Equivalently, exploration is concerned with answering the question, “what do these
    data tell me that I don’t already know?” Tasks that fall into this category are
    also “characterizing the haystack” tasks, although — contrary to the quote by
    King and Hopkins — both computer scientists <em>and</em> social scientists perform
    exploratory analyses. Interestingly, though, neither group tends to explicitly
    acknowledge exploration as a “first order” modeling task. Commonly used exploratory
    models include latent Dirichlet allocation, factor analysis, and stochastic block
    models.</p><p>When thinking about the ways in which models for granular, social
    data can exhibit bias or unfairness, it’s important to think not only about predictive
    models, but also about models for explanation and exploration. In part, this is
    because such models are extremely well suited to answering questions about granular,
    social data, but it’s also because explanatory and exploratory analyses tend to
    be an important precursor to predictive modeling. The first step, when building
    or deploying a predictive model, is to decide which features of the observed data
    to focus on — that is, to choose appropriate input and output representations.
    To do this, we typically rely upon existing knowledge — often from previous explanatory
    or exploratory analyses, performed by ourselves or by others. Of course, the models
    used to perform these previous analyses — and any bias or unfairness in them —
    will necessarily influence the resultant findings and hence the representations
    we choose to use in our predictive models.</p><p>When reading about predictive
    models in the literature on fairness and transparency in machine learning, one
    of the things that really stood out to me was a repeated discussion of the dangers
    of unnoticed errors. As Moritz <a href="https://medium.com/@mrtz/how-big-data-is-unfair-9aa544d739de">notes</a>,
    when classifying user names as “real” or “fake,” there’s a big difference between
    a model that’s 95% accurate because of noise and one that’s 95% accurate because
    it nails classifying white, American names but achieves only 50% accuracy when
    classifying names from other cultures. This example clearly highlights the importance
    of careful error analysis.</p><p>I want to take this opportunity to note that
    error analysis needn’t be a tedious exercise in “good practices” or “covering
    your tail.” It can also be an opportunity to identify unexpected research directions.
    Personally, it is at this point — where I’ve run my experiments, seen where my
    model fails, <em>and then gone on to figure out why</em> — that some of my most
    innovative machine learning research has taken place. Moreover, if errors do relate
    to bias, fairness, and inclusion, fixing them will yield not only performance
    gains, but the kinds of performance gains that are actually important to society.</p><p>One
    way of preventing or mitigating errors is to explicitly represent and maintain
    uncertainty. For any predictive model, some predictions will be less confident
    than others. Moreover, it is likely that those less confident predictions will
    be about minority groups. To illustrate this point, I want to return to Moritz’s
    observation that even for large data sets, there is always proportionally less
    data available about minorities, and that this data may even be substantively
    different to that of the majority. Error bars or some other representation of
    uncertainty can therefore help with error analysis by indicating when even correct
    predictions may be predicated on weak information. They can also be used by decision-makers
    in order to identify those decisions that may require additional human input.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*bj86D3blKVXJ2z5Us_eSXA.png" alt=""></p><p>For
    example consider this classifier with a decision boundary that does a good job
    of separating the data with which it was trained, represented by pluses and dots.
    How should this model classify these points out here? Granted, their perpendicular
    distance from the decision boundary is relatively large, suggesting that they
    may be pluses, but they’re also in a very different region of space to that of
    the training data. As a result, it seems prudent to make less certain predictions
    about these points and — importantly — to report, rather than ignore, that uncertainty.</p><p>Many
    popular machine learning methods do not represent uncertainty when making predictions.
    Furthermore, even when using methods that <em>do</em> represent uncertainty, this
    uncertainty is often discarded. Sometimes these choices are justified by the argument
    that ultimately a concrete decision has to be made, so representing and maintaining
    uncertainty is an unnecessary waste of storage or computation. While this may
    be true for some tasks, I would argue that when building and using predictive
    models for social data—where the resultant decisions can affect real-world people
    — representing, maintaining, and reporting uncertainty along with any decisions
    should be standard practice. A lot of my own research has focused on Bayesian
    methods for exactly this reason.</p><p>Model validation and error analysis are
    much trickier for exploratory models. Unlike prediction tasks, most exploration
    tasks don’t typically have a single right answer, so it can be hard to know whether
    or not an exploratory model is doing a good job. However, rather than ignoring
    the problem entirely, I would advocate taking a multifaceted approach to model
    validation by identifying several different qualitative and quantitative tasks,
    each intended to validate a particular aspect or property of the model in question.
    For example, a good model for exploring network data should perform reasonably
    at link prediction, even though link prediction is not the ultimate modeling goal.
    Meanwhile, a good statistical topic model should exhibit coherent topics according
    to either an automated coherence metric or a domain expert. Both types of models
    should pass various posterior predictive checks. Taken together, these validation
    tasks can then be thought of as effectively validating the model as a whole. Poor
    performance on particular tasks can reveal information about the situations in
    which the model should and shouldn’t be used.</p><p>I want to conclude this section
    by reiterating my take-home messages about models. First, when thinking about
    the ways in which models can exhibit bias or unfairness, we need to consider models
    for explanation and exploration, as well as models for prediction. Second, if
    we want to achieve fairness, we need to perform rigorous error analysis and model
    validation. Finally, we should use modeling frameworks that allow us to represent,
    maintain, and report uncertainty in decisions or other findings.</p><h2>Findings</h2><p>In
    the final section of my talk, I want to focus briefly on drawing responsible,
    fair conclusions from granular, social data.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*WYo4QZrCpLT0eqToiBn7CA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Few computer scientists or engineers would consider developing models
    or tools for analyzing astronomy data without involving astronomers. So, why,
    then, are so many methods for analyzing social data developed without the involvement
    social scientists? I think, in part, it’s because, as humans, we have strong intuitions
    about the social world. <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/duncan/">Duncan
    Watts</a>’ recent book, “<a href="http://everythingisobvious.com/the-book/">Everything
    is Obvious</a>,” addresses this exact point — that humans are really good using
    at using intuition, at rationalizing, and at narrativizing. But, intuition is
    often wrong and narratives are not historical fact. For example, we all possesses
    attitudes, stereotypes, or other “cognitive shortcuts” that unconsciously influence
    our understanding, actions, and decisions. Some of these shortcuts may be positive,
    but others may be negative, especially towards people different to ourselves.
    Being aware that these “implicit biases” exist, and that everyone possesses them
    — even scientists — is an important step toward drawing fair and unbiased conclusions.</p><p>I
    would therefore argue that in order to aggregate and analyze granular, social
    data in a way that responsibly addresses issues of bias and inclusion, we need
    to make sure we’re working in a fair, accountable, and scientific fashion, rather
    than relying solely — or even primarily — on intuition. Returning to one of my
    take-home messages from the first part of my talk, one effective way to do this
    is to work closely with social scientists, who tend to be better trained at interpreting
    findings so as to acknowledge, account for, and challenge bias. Their training,
    as well as their research, can help us to be more aware of human factors that
    can influence both the process of drawing conclusions, as well as the types of
    conclusions drawn.</p><p>As an example, I want to highlight the phenomenon of
    confirmation bias. Confirmation bias is the process of seeking or favoring information
    that confirms one’s preconceived hypotheses, while ignoring or downplaying contradictory
    evidence. Although confirmation bias can occur with predictive analyses, it tends
    to be a bigger issue with exploratory analyses, where the goal is to answer the
    question, “what do these data tell me?” This can be especially problematic when
    working with large quantities of social data, not only because people often have
    stronger preconceptions, but because the sizes of and imbalances in these data
    sets can make it (comparatively) easy to keep searching until one finds some kind
    of supposed supporting evidence for these preconceptions. Addressing confirmation
    bias involves being willing to search for both confirmatory and contradictory
    evidence for hypothesized findings — a time-consuming process. <a href="http://evcp.berkeley.edu/claude-steele-bio">Claude
    Steele</a>, a social psychologist, has spent years demonstrating that academic
    performance can be harmed by the cognitive load of stereotype threat — that is,
    the fear of confirming a negative stereotype. For instance, when taking a math
    test, simply being reminded that they are female causes women to feel the threat
    of confirming negative stereotypes about women and math, and their test scores
    drop accordingly. This finding possesses a very different causal structure to
    “woman are inherently worse at math than men.” Teasing apart these alternatives
    required years of careful experimentation on the part of Steele and his colleagues,
    as well as the willingness to question a controversial, though common, belief
    about women and their inherent mathematical ability.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*wifbq4kpfMmSepr5kzHdKg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Finally, I want to return very briefly to transparency and accountability.
    Although I’m a firm believer in interdisciplinary teams, it’s likely that many
    machine learning methods will, at some point, be used by social scientists, policy-makers,
    or other end-users, without the involvement of those who developed them. If we
    want people to draw responsible conclusions using our models and tools, then we
    need people to understand how they work, rather than treating them as infallible
    “black boxes.” This means not only publishing academic papers and making research
    code available, but also explaining our models and tools to general audiences
    and, when doing so, focusing on elucidating implicit assumptions, best practices
    for selecting and deploying them, and the types of conclusions they can and can’t
    be used to draw.</p><p>With that, I’m going to end, but before I do so, I want
    to briefly summarize my take-home messages about findings. First, it’s important
    to be aware of concepts like implicit bias and to be willing to challenge negative
    stereotypes about minority groups, even when this requires additional effort.
    Second, it we want others to use our methods fairly and responsibly, and without
    our hands-on involvement, we need a community-wide increase in commitment to the
    public understanding of science.</p><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>Thanks to <a href="http://timvieira.github.io/">Tim

  :title: Science’s Greatest Lesson For Humanity Is ‘How To Be Wrong’
  :content: '<p>Science’s Greatest Lesson For Humanity Is ‘How To Be Wrong’</p><h3>If
    you don’t learn this one lesson, you’ll not only never be good at science, you’ll
    never learn anything new.</h3><blockquote><p><em>“Right is right even if no one
    is doing it; wrong is wrong even if everyone is doing it.” -</em>Augustine of
    Hippo</p></blockquote><p>For some, science is one of the most frustrating subjects
    out there. On the one hand, it holds the promise of learning how the world or
    even the Universe works, and has proven itself more successful than perhaps any
    other method of inquiry. But on the other hand, it’s incredibly difficult to get
    it right. Science demands a lot from its practitioners, in the form of problem
    solving, experimental setup and care, and mathematical analysis. There is no scientist
    in history, living or dead, who ever got everything right at every turn. We’ve
    all been mistaken at one point or another, but the greatest lesson that science
    teaches you isn’t that we’re fallible, but how to behave when you discover that
    you’re wrong.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*hIIDFvvXjeA7THW4."

    with a scientific worldview is no small feat. You only begin with laws: simple
    relationships between measurable quantities that might not appear to be superficially
    related. Relationships between force and acceleration (Newton’s law), pressure
    and volume (Boyle’s law), or velocity and distance for galaxies (Hubble’s law)
    aren’t the pinnacle of science, but merely the beginning. Noticing those relationships
    and applying them is an important step, as it can teach you how to find an unknown
    quantity if you have the right pieces of information.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*U-i8CbloW54CGaOW."

    the reason these relationships are what they are? That requires a deeper understanding:
    a scientific framework that underlies how these quantities affect one another.
    Newton’s law exists because momentum is conserved in our Universe; Boyle’s law
    exists because gases are made of molecules that obey the conservation of energy;
    Hubble’s law occurs because the Universe is expanding. These are frameworks that
    you can learn, although the people who came up with them had many false starts
    before getting it right. Yet the real difficulty comes with the next step.</p><p><img

    But we didn’t always know these solutions, and moreover, we know that these aren’t
    the final solutions to all our problems. A valid scientific theory is the most
    advanced level of understanding you can reach about our natural Universe, but
    it isn’t the same as an absolute truth. It’s simply the best quantitative description
    we have for the Universe today, and it’s always subject to revision, improvement,
    or even revolution.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*k-SJnKD8JabdHOBp."

    things occur, and how you can test out your own ideas. You’ll see to revise and
    improve them over time, and to base your decisions on what the full suite of evidence
    shows. So enough with the false pretenses that we know it all. It’s time to take

  :title: 6 uncommon principles for effective data sciences
  :content: '<p>How to conceptualize and implement effective data science projects</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*ziqFSyjY1luNPBJi9Aeufw.png" alt="Results,
    not hype"><em>Results, not hype</em></p><h2><strong>Motivation</strong></h2><p>The
    more I delve in data science, the more convinced I am that companies and data
    science practitioners must have a clear view on how to cut through the machine
    learning and AI hype, to implement an effective data science strategy that drives
    business value. This article hopes to establish a framework to conceptualize and
    implement effective data science projects.</p><h2><strong>Why should you care</strong></h2><p>Showing
    that you as a data scientist can derive meaningful insights which improve revenue
    and profits will result in yourself being more valuable to the company. With highly
    optimized and easily implementable machine learning and deep learning libraries,
    any data monkey can build sophisticated AI algorithms with just a few lines of
    code. However, a sophisticated model does not equate to an effective model. Knowing
    how the model output translates into real world application is key.</p><p>From
    a company’s perspective, data scientists, as with any other employee, get paid
    according to the value they generate. If a company pays employees more than the
    value they bring, then the company loses money. Clearly not a sustainable long
    run strategy. Yes, data scientists are drawing high salaries now, but if companies
    cannot extract the value they think they can from data science, salaries and demand
    for data scientists will eventually fall.</p><h2>Problem: Data scientists tend
    to focus more on the means than the ends</h2><p>Because of the results AI researchers
    have achieved over the last few years (<a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/GlamorousSpikyWombatDBstyle">play
    GTA</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/j60J1cGINX4">compose Chopin-esq music piece</a>s),
    many companies are jumping on the bandwagon to herald the new era of AI.</p><p>This
    is all well and good, but because of the nascent application of data science in
    a business context, information asymmetry exists. Data scientist practitioners
    tend to have a technical background, and often view their main goal as building
    state of the art algorithms. On the other hand, other employees view AI as a black
    box, commonly through the lens of the high profile breakthroughs from AI researchers
    (for example, AI capable of beating top Go players). Because of the disjoint between
    the technical and the commercial segments of the business, output from data scientists
    may not be actionable or commercially meaningful.</p><h2>Solution: Don’t miss
    the forest for the trees; Practical data science is about driving value, not about
    optimizing accuracy</h2><p>We can think of practical data science as a stool with
    3 legs: programming, statistics, and business understanding, and if we are missing
    any one leg, the stool collapses. We all know this, but business understanding
    is rarely if ever the focus in data science articles or forums.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3000/1*4UBz9bQjTCO5NalUS9qBPw.jpeg"
    alt="The three pillars of data science"><em>The three pillars of data science</em></p><p>Programming
    and math are necessary but not sufficient to be an effective data scientist, as
    technical skills are merely a means to an end.** **Helping companies improve customer
    retention, helping the poor get loans, improving health by diagnosing diseases
    earlier — these are the goals that data scientists should focus on; machine learning
    / AI is merely a means to achieve that end.</p><h2>The 6 principles for effective
    data science</h2><p>Sticking to the six principles below will enable data scientists
    conceptualize and implement effective projects.</p><h2>1. Understand the AI hierarchy
    of needs</h2><p>Much like how humans need food, water, and air before they can
    achieve self-actualization, building a reliable data flow is key to doing anything
    with data. Only when data is accessible then can it be explored and transformed.
    When cleaned data can be easily explored, better customer understanding can be
    achieved. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/@mrogati?source=post_header_lockup">*Monica
    Rogati</a>’s* excellent article, <em>‘<a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007">The
    AI Hierarchy of Needs</a>’</em>, provides a clear framework to think about this.</p><p>Many
    companies want the outcome AI brings, but do not have the right infrastructure
    in place to implement machine learning. Companies should be aware that machine
    learning / deep learning comes late in entire data stack. Data first has to be
    reliably <em>collected</em>, then can it be <em>transformed</em> and subsequently
    <em>explored</em>. A broken upstream process (for example, if tracking is inaccurate)
    will affect the cleanliness of data and ultimately the insights gained it. Only
    when data is clean and easily explored, then can it be used for BI, analytics,
    and AI.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2332/1*QROIoo2dC42Wn1_a_3APTA.png"
    alt="Diagram adapted from [Monica Rogati’s excellent article, ‘The AI Hierarchy
    of Needs’](https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007)"><em>Diagram
    adapted from <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007">Monica
    Rogati’s excellent article, ‘The AI Hierarchy of Needs’</a></em></p><p><strong><em>Implications
    of the AI hierarchy of needs — scale up data infrastructure before thinking about
    machine learning or deep learning</em></strong></p><p>This hierarchy implies that
    companies should hire according to this order of needs. What does this mean? If
    your company is not set up to scale machine learning yet, then the focus should
    be on those tasks instead of deep learning. As with coding, it is a sequential
    process where the right building blocks must first be in place before the next
    level can be achieved.</p><p>A recipe for disaster is for a data scientist experienced
    in modelling to be hired at a start-up that does not have the proper tracking
    and databases in place. Employees should also have their expectations in check
    pertaining to the work they will be doing prior to joining a company.</p><p>As
    a data scientist, knowing how to properly design table schemas or build data pipelines
    can be important but yet underrated skills which many companies require, especially
    since most data science courses and machine learning competitions tend to focus
    on the ‘sexier’ aspects of machine learning.</p><h2><strong>2. Build models that
    answer the right questions</strong></h2><p>Early decisions, and consequently early
    assumptions in projects, often have a disproportionate impact on the entire project.
    The decision you make a day or week into the project — assumptions about the needs
    of end users, how the output of the model can be used — have the most significant
    impact on the effectiveness of the model. As decisions are made later and later
    in the project, their influence decrease. Choosing how to clean dirty data or
    what features to use will affect the accuracy of the model, but the biggest factors
    that determine if a machine learning model can be deployed into production come
    from the questions you ask at the start of the project.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*-PCEL2FnwH2r9ysI3ztzSQ.png"
    alt="Early decisions have disproportionately large impact on projects"><em>Early
    decisions have disproportionately large impact on projects</em></p><p>It is easy
    to understand this point on the surface, and yet few people consider the implications.</p><p>In
    order to build a model that has an actionable outcome, the following has to be
    done before a single line of code is typed: communicating with ends users, understanding
    business rules that are already in place, looking at existing data and thinking
    of how to define the “ground truth” for the model to be trained on such that it
    is meaningful for end users, understanding the limitations of the proposed model,
    and stress testing the predicted output of the model with business users.</p><p>Here’s
    an example to illustrate this point.</p><p><strong><em>Building a churn prediction
    model</em></strong></p><p>You are approached by the marketing department to build
    a machine learning model to predict which customers have churned. The marketing
    department tells you that having such an output is useful so they can better re-target
    customers to improve customer retention. As a data scientist, this seems like
    a simple, straightforward task. Build a binary classification model with output
    of 1 being a churned customer and 0 being an active customer. In fact, you tell
    your colleagues that you can one-up their request by giving them the probability
    that a customer churns.</p><p>Further discussions take place, and you learn that
    marketing defines churned customers as customers who have not ordered in a year
    or more. You decide to follow their existing logic and label your model’s targets
    as such.</p><p>Your present your plan, and the marketing department gives you
    the go ahead to build the model. You spend weeks pulling and cleaning data, defining
    your loss function, determining your cross-validation strategy, training and tuning
    your model, validating your results, and end up with an AUC of 0.9. You are elated
    with the results and proudly present your findings to the marketing team, telling
    them what data and model was used, and how to interpret AUC.</p><p>The marketing
    department has comments:</p><ul><li><p>Subscribers who recently signed up but
    not made orders are labelled by the model as churned users. This should not be
    the case as the order cycle is longer. More broadly, users who sign up at different
    times should have different definitions of churn. A frequent customer who does
    not buy in six months may be considered as churned, while a new user who has not
    bought in six months may not be churned, because the normal buying cycle is a
    year or more.</p></li><li><p>The marketing department realizes that customers
    predicted by the model to churn are already targeted from existing retention efforts.
    They implemented a simple business rule, where customers who have not purchased
    in six months are already given the max discount possible. Can the model output
    provide reasons for customer churn?</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>Takeaways from
    the churn prediction model</em></strong></p><p>No matter how accurate the model
    is, answering the wrong question is time wasted.</p><p><em>The business may not
    always know what it needs in advance, *as business managers may not understand
    how machine learning works.</em> *Challenge what the business tells you. In this
    case, is predicting churn useful? Or do we want to instead predict how likely
    will a customer respond to an existing churn offer so that marketing can better
    target their existing campaigns? Being able to do this efficiently involves understanding
    the business and customers.</p><p>*Definition of targets is extremely important.
    *How the business defines churn, and how you want to train your model may be different,
    as training the model with existing churn definitions can result in predictions
    that do not make business sense. In this case, being aware of different segments
    of customers (for example, a top customer and a new user) and their different
    lifecycles is key to getting a meaningful prediction. Understanding the model
    output based on the way the model is trained is necessary.</p><h2><strong><em>3.
    Pick projects that add the most value for the business</em></strong></h2><p>Asking
    the right questions is also important when choosing what projects to work on.
    Ideally, prioritized projects should be the ones that have the biggest areas of
    opportunity <em>for the business</em>. Machine learning projects take time to
    roll-out, and the cost of undertaking the wrong projects may exceed the benefits.</p><p>The
    importance of asking the right questions is further highlighted given the empirical
    nature of machine learning where results are not guaranteed. Conducting exploratory
    data analysis may not yield much insight, and building a model may not yield results
    better than the existing business rules implemented. There needs to be a significant
    asymmetry between the gains (<em>they need to be large</em>) and the costs (<em>small
    or harmless</em>) of undertaking a project, and it is from such asymmetry that
    empirical projects <em>(trial and error)</em> can produce results. Convexity is
    a mathematical property that represents this.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*zGKmgKjg0x4DDa_IQbQ8yg.png"
    alt="Graphical representation of a convex strategy"><em>Graphical representation
    of a convex strategy</em></p><p>Machine learning projects can be likened to cooking,
    which largely relies on trial and error, as we have not been able to concoct a
    dish directly from chemical equations. We take rice, and add different combinations
    of ingredients, say soy sauce and turmeric powder, taste to see if there’s an
    improvement from the interaction between ingredients. We then keep the good recipes
    and discard the rest. Importantly, we have the option and not the obligation to
    keep the result, which allows us to keep our upside while severely limiting the
    downside. In the case of machine learning, if models are not yet implemented in
    production, the downside is time spent working on those models. This “optionality”
    results in the convexity of machine learning projects as it allows a data scientist
    to get more upside than downside by selecting the best model and forgetting the
    rest. Critically, this means that the projects selected has to have a high potential
    upside for the business.</p><p>Calculating the size of the opportunity before
    building a machine learning model can help determine a project’s potential impact
    on the business. This potential impact can then be weighed against the estimated
    time spent on the project to gauge project convexity.</p><p>Generic formula to
    calculate size of business opportunity:</p><blockquote><p><strong>number of customers
    affected * target size of effect = Estimated project impact</strong></p></blockquote><p><em>**Embark
    on projects which directly impacts business levers. *</em>*It’s also important
    to ensure that the output of machine learning models directly impact business
    levers. This would result in projects which are directly actionable. As an example,
    an e-commerce company may ask its data science team to identify customers which
    have a strong intent towards a certain brand or item category. Merely predicting
    whether a customer has a strong intent or not is not enough, as intent does not
    directly impact any business levers. Ideally, we still want to send those with
    strong intent what they are interested in. Identifying customers with intent is
    only half the equation — identifying what products to serve these customers is
    just as important.</p><h2>4. Iterate Fast</h2><p><em>**Iterating fast is almost
    always best with convex strategies. *</em>*In order to take advantage of the empirical
    nature of machine learning and the optionality we have to keep the best models,
    we should reduce the cost per attempt. A large exposure to a single trial has
    lower expected returns than a portfolio of small trials when we’re dealing with
    a convex function where our cost is the time spent per iteration. Reducing the
    cost per attempt will mean having a higher number of trials, and allocating 1/N
    of our time across N trials allows us to minimize the probability of missing rather
    than maximizing profits should we have a win.</p><p>In practice, what this means
    is that baseline models need not be trained on the full data before implementation
    (e.g. models can be trained solely for a single geography), or that first building
    simple machine learning models can help gauge whether an output from a model can
    be implemented in practice.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2370/1*iVUsW9do7UUfIlR4VVOv0A.png"
    alt="Simple technologies can have a big impact when correctly applied"><em>Simple
    technologies can have a big impact when correctly applied</em></p><p><em>**Less
    is often more. *</em>*It took about a million years between discovering fire and
    using fire to generate power via a steam engine. It is sometimes the simplest
    technologies that are ignored. In practice there is no premium for complexification;
    in the corporate world there is. Looking at the latest technologies used in AI
    research invites complexity, where in practice implementing simple business rules
    after data exploration may be all it takes to extract value from data.</p><p>Having
    a variety of perspectives is important; as the saying goes: if all you have is
    a hammer, everything looks like a nail. One might not see things clearly if one
    relies too much on a particular tool, method, or mindset. In practice, the results
    achieved by combining data exploration with business acumen (for example, tailored
    customer segments) is quick to roll out and surprisingly difficult for machine
    learning models to beat. Using data in such a way enables a data scientist to
    iterate fast, as well as helps build a good baseline to measure machine learning
    models against.</p><h2><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Data is no magic bullet (not
    yet at least)</strong></h2><p>Understanding the limitations of data and how machine
    learning algorithms work* *is important to know which models are worth building.
    The effectiveness of machine learning algorithms is only as good the data used,
    and many times, the data collected does not fully represent reality, especially
    when it comes to human behavior.</p><p>This is why AI has had greater breakthroughs
    in some fields and not others. In computer vision problems, the numbers used to
    represent an image or video exactly represents what the model is trying to predict.
    To phrase it in another way, the entire hypothesis space is encoded in the data
    in computer vision problems. In contrast, share prices are heavily influenced
    by human biases, and using a neural network to predict stock prices using daily
    closing prices, volume traded, and news sentiment analysis will not yield as good
    a result as in computer vision problems, precisely because the human psychology
    and emotions behind why shares and bought and sold cannot be encoded in data.</p><p><strong><em>Implications:
    Scale down problem, and get input from the business to better encode information
    in the model</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Scale down scope of problem.</em></strong>
    This does not mean that data science cannot be applied when human behavior is
    involved, but its use has to be scaled down. For example, hedge funds use NLP
    to conduct sentiment analysis, which is just one of the tools used to augment
    investing decisions. Or in the case above, instead of predicting when will a customer
    churn, predicting how likely a customer will respond to a churn email offer based
    on the customer’s previous email open and click through rates may be more meaningful.</p><p>**<em>Use
    business knowledge to improve raw data.</em> **By incorporating business knowledge,
    new variables can be created from raw data to enable machine learning models to
    better discover useful patterns. This improves model performance with the same
    data. Data scientists are experts in their own domain, and the exploratory data
    analysis done by data scientists will often not yield as much as the insights
    which come from business experts. As an example, an e-commerce business have products
    are tagged to thousands of subcategories, many of which are extremely similar.
    With business knowledge, more appropriate tagging of products can be done to better
    represent distinct subcategories. This allows the model to better understand the
    differences in subcategories and produce better results.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tirthajyoti-sarkar-2127aa7/">**Tirthajyoti
    Sarkar</a> **so eloquently puts it in <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/09/when-bayes-ockham-shannon-come-together-define-machine-learning.html">this
    article</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“For practical machine learning, it might sometimes
    be <strong>easier for a human designer to specify a representation that captures
    knowledge about the relative probabilities of hypotheses</strong> than it is to
    fully specify the probability of each hypothesis.This is where the <strong>matter
    of knowledge representation and domain expertise</strong> become critically important.
    It short-circuits the (often) infinitely large hypothesis space and leads us towards
    a highly probable set of hypothesis which we can optimally encode and work towards
    finding the set of MAP hypotheses among them.”</p></blockquote><h2>6. Models must
    be carefully evaluated by the business before deployment</h2><p>Last mile problems
    are the final hurdles to deploying a machine learning model. Asking a machine
    learning model to provide the right answers 100% of the time is impossible and
    having recommendations from models that violate basic business rules is not uncommon.</p><p>Using
    the churn prediction model again as an example, predicting that a user churns
    a few weeks after they sign up is not meaningful. Business stakeholders should
    thus carefully evaluate the output from machine learning models before deployment.</p><p><strong><em>Apply
    business rules as a safe-guard</em></strong></p><p>Having an extra layer of business
    rules is imperative for quality assurance, as well as help prevent a faulty machine
    learning model that compromises customer experience from being launched. Deciding
    what business rules to implement stem from sanity checks conducted by the business.</p><p>Concretely,
    the sanity checks can include:</p><ul><li>ensuring model output is meaningful
    by validating the model output against different customer characteristics. The
    exact customer characteristics used for validation highly depends on the model’s
    use case. If the model is predicting when top customers will churn, check if the
    model output only includes top customers, and including characteristics like last
    site browse date, last order date, average basket size, number of orders made
    can help to validate the output</li></ul><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>The
    six principles behind effective data science are not complex. You can liken them
    to hyperparameter tuning, where these hyperparmeters determine, on a scale from
    0 to 100, how valuable the model output is to the business. Tweaking any one of
    these will affect the value the project brings.</p><p>Ensuring that there is a
    AI hierarchy of needs where data is first collected and subsequently cleaned and
    transformed in a database is crucial for scalable machine learning.</p><p>Asking
    the right questions before embarking on any project and ensuring the model output
    answers those questions asked will help ensure the output of the project is meaningful.</p><p>Thinking
    about convexity and weighing the potential costs and benefits of a project will
    help with picking the ones that effect the most value for the business.</p><p>At
    the same time, having a mindset to iterate fast allows us to have more attempts,
    which minimizes the probability of us having trivial results — especially important
    in machine learning where it’s exploratory in nature. An extension of iterating
    fast is to aim to use analytics or machine learning techniques that are the most
    effective and not necessarily the most complex.</p><p>Being able to understand
    the limitations of data will help define the scope of a project, to ensure the
    output is not gibberish. Gaining insights from the business to better engineer
    features can help improve models.</p><p>Lastly, sanity checks by the business
    are necessary safeguards to prevent recommendations leading to a poor customer
    experience.</p><p>Thanks for reading, I hope you found this article useful. Let’s
    have a conversation if you disagreed with any points above, or if you have more
    useful principles for implementing machine learning projects!</p>'

    been and continues to be the best place to be a data scientist, and the best place
    to grow a data science company and build a data science team.***</p><h2>Why New
    York City?</h2><blockquote><h1>“The [2008 financial crisis] created a perfect
    storm of talent exiting afflicted institutions and investment money fleeing the
    public sector markets.”</h1></blockquote><h3>First, some history</h3><p>Contrary
    to popular belief, New York has actually always been a major data science hub.
    The reason New York is often overlooked as a cornerstone of the data science community
    is because almost all the city’s data scientists were previously locked within
    enormous institutions like banks, ad agencies, and major media companies. They
    held vague and cryptic titles like <em>quant</em>, <em>statistician</em>, or <em>business
    intelligence analyst</em>.</p><p>Instead of thinking of themselves as a community
    that could leverage their expertise to transform how data is used, they maintained
    focus on building specific analytical tools and products for their own particular
    domains of expertise. This went on for years.</p><p>But then something really
    tragic happened: the financial crisis of 2008, which delivered a huge blow to
    the city of New York; to both its denizens and its businesses. However, out of
    this calamity came an opportunity. The crisis created a perfect storm of talent
    exiting afflicted institutions and investment money fleeing the public sector
    markets.</p><p>Most significantly, New York’s data scientists started coming together
    to talk about their work and ideas. This gathering of diverse backgrounds and
    experiences spawned a unique, cohesive data science community that, quite frankly,
    doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world.</p><h3>Diversity of talent and of thought</h3><blockquote><h1>“As
    a diverse group comprised of skeptical academics, social sector employees, and
    public and municipal organizations, data scientists in NYC deal with the question
    of how data is really serving people on a daily basis.”</h1></blockquote><p>One
    of the reasons New York’s data community stands out from the rest is that it is
    the best at recognizing the need for both natural sciences and social sciences
    to come together to do truly great and innovative data work. Part of our job as
    data scientists is to be good at math and modeling complex systems, while also
    incorporating a deep understanding of human decision making, the most complex
    system there is. New York’s data science community is a diverse collection of
    talented data scientists who are uniquely able to balance and implement both of
    these components into their work.</p><p>New York’s data scientists have not only
    helped to build many innovative and successful businesses (AppNexus, Bitly, Tumblr,
    Kickstarter, Jet.com, Vimeo, Oscar Health, Enigma, Greenhouse, MongoDB, ZocDoc,
    OnDeck, Etsy, Venmo, Blue Apron, Fast Forward Labs, Clarifai, etc. etc.) but the
    Data for Good movement started here too. There are numerous New York-based organizations
    that have put using data for social good at the core of what they do, such as
    DataKind, Crisis Text Line, Murmuration, Mt. Sinai’s Arnhold Institute for Global
    Health, and Teachers Pay Teachers, as well as the NYC Mayor’s Office for Data
    &amp; Analytics, founded in 2013 under Mayor Bloomberg.</p><p>As a diverse group
    comprised of skeptical academics, social sector employees, and public and municipal
    organizations, data scientists in NYC deal with the question of how data is really
    serving people on a daily basis. They also take the time to step back and ask
    “Okay, there’s lots of good work happening, but what are the limits?” New York
    City’s density and diversity support this kind of questioning, by keeping all
    of us in direct contact with the users and consumers we’re hoping to serve.</p><h3>Density
    as a forcing function</h3><blockquote><h1>“If you work at a software firm where
    you sit by yourself and imagine what your customer needs or wants are, you’ll
    never be as successful as you could if you’re able to walk down the street from
    your office and talk directly to your customers.”</h1></blockquote><p>Bustling
    sidewalks and crowded subways aside, New Yorkers living in close proximity to
    one another has benefits for folks in enterprise businesses as well. A common
    challenge for many startups is the constant need to better understand their users.
    Who is using our product? How are they using it? What issues are they having?
    If you work at a software firm where you sit by yourself and imagine what your
    customer needs or wants are, you’ll never be as successful as you could if you’re
    able to walk down the street from your office and talk directly to your customers.
    New York City has more Fortune 500 companies than any other city in the US. It’s
    HQ central for so many industries: media, advertising, financial services, banking,
    fashion, large-scale retail… the list goes on and on.</p><p>In New York, we almost
    take it for granted that on any given day, whether it’s at <a href="https://datasociety.net/">Data
    &amp; Society</a>, at <a href="http://insightdatascience.com/">Insight Data Science</a>,
    or at <a href="http://civichall.org/">Civic Hall</a>, there are conversations
    going on about what it means to be a professional data scientist. Instead of staying
    buried in a text editor all day, many of us are grappling with the ethical and
    social challenges that come with data science. And in New York City, there is
    an appetite to discuss and share the latest trends and topics in data science.</p><p>The
    community’s diversity and willingness to ask the “hard questions” about what we’re
    capable of are reflected in the ecosystem of companies that have emerged in New
    York. One of the biggest challenges currently facing all data scientists is a
    lack of a clear career trajectory. What does it mean to be a “Head of Data Science”
    or “Chief Data Officer”? At the moment there are now a lot of data scientists
    but not a lot of data science managers. What does it mean to develop leadership
    inside this community? What are the things that we need to do to create the <em>next</em>
    generation of data science leaders from all the people sitting in our big tent?</p><p>The
    good news for the world’s future data scientists and managers is that building
    an innovative data team in New York is not only possible, but their best bet for
    opportunity and growth. The community’s diversity will allow them to combine methodologies
    that work well from fields with more established pathways like software engineering,
    scientific research careers, or product management, and mesh them with less obvious
    systems modeled after those in finance, healthcare, design, and media. Our ability
    to foster conversation and collaboration across these areas is what will eventually
    allow those of us in NYC to shape the trajectory of data science careers well
    into the future.</p><p><em>**Interested in transitioning to a career in data science?</em>*

  :title: How the California Academy of Sciences Makes Discovery a Delight
  :content: '<p>Innovative exhibits and citizen science bring people closer to nature</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/1*JRiuC6om782eb9dsG8D8Dw.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>Before
    you read this article, take a moment away from your computer. Put down your phone
    and step outside. Look closely at whatever you find.</p><p><em>The shape of a
    leaf.The texture of a rock.The swooping flight of a bird.</em></p><p>What is that
    leaf? How old is that rock? Why does that bird behave the way it does?</p><p>When
    we open our minds to nature and ask questions about how it works, we appreciate
    it more deeply. We also become more aware of how human activity is changing the
    world in fundamental ways. Humans are altering the landscape, changing ecological
    balances, and even affecting the global climate.</p><p>That’s why science education
    is more critical today than at any point in human history. Knowledge is vital
    if we are to take care of our world in the face of new challenges.</p><p>The <a
    href="https://www.calacademy.org/">California Academy of Sciences</a> champions
    research, education, and sustainability across the globe. Their innovative museum
    exhibits bring scientific knowledge to the public, and their “citizen science”
    program inspires the public to help increase that knowledge. It’s a symbiotic
    relationship that benefits us all.</p><p><center><iframe width="560" height="315"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0sP5Payb6dM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p><p>Tamara
    Schwarz, the Academy’s Director of Exhibit Development and Strategic Planning,
    is a passionate advocate for science. “The mission of the Academy is to explore,
    explain, and sustain life on Earth,” she explains. “That’s a meaningful mission.
    Some people are intimidated by what they think science is. I want to help them
    appreciate that science is a valuable part of our civic life. It’s not that everybody
    has to be a scientist, but we want everyone to leave with a sense of excitement,
    curiosity, and wonder about the natural world.”</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/11668/1*ROV6GB89CVa2ydgqstinvw.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><h2><em>One exhibit’s two-year journey</em></h2><p>Over a million people
    visit the Academy each year, drawn to its <a href="https://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/steinhart-aquarium">aquarium</a>,
    <a href="https://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/morrison-planetarium">planetarium</a>,
    and <a href="https://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/osher-rainforest">living indoor
    rainforest</a>. But the Academy is also home to more than 100 research scientists,
    thousands of live animals, and nearly 46 million research specimens.</p><p>Everything
    comes together in <a href="https://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/giants-of-land-and-sea">*Giants
    of Land and Sea</a>*, an exhibit two years in the making that reveals the unique
    natural wonder of Northern California’s coast. “The idea was to help our visitors
    look at the places they already cared about with a fresh perspective, in ways
    they haven’t thought of before,” Tamara explains.</p><p>A cross-functional team
    of designers, content specialists, educators, technologists, media producers,
    and others worked on the exhibit. “We also work closely with our in-house scientists,”
    Tamara adds, “from helping us define topics and themes through making sure that
    we’re aware of the latest research.”</p><p>The Academy’s collection is vast, meaning
    they had many possible directions to follow. “Our research collections have drawers
    and drawers, shelves and rooms full of specimens. Each one has a unique story
    to tell, and those stories help us understand how things are changing.”</p><p>Tamara’s
    team had to manage a mountain of information as well. “We do a tremendous amount
    of reading, gathering papers published in scientific journals, interviewing scientists,”
    she says. “We use <a href="https://evernote.com/business">Evernote</a> to collect
    all of those things, keep track of sources, and share highlights with other members
    of the team. We have a standard set of five or six notebooks for each exhibit
    project, and we’re working on half a dozen projects at a time. Knowing that everything
    is in a central location is really helpful.”</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/11668/1*jPDmBKefrbsNrNnmF34bKw.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>Finalizing an exhibit takes many iterations. “At a certain point,
    we have to go from having this massive amount of information to figuring out what
    is the specific story that we’re telling in this exhibit,” Tamara says. “For every
    photo that ends up on a panel in our galleries, we may have looked at 25 other
    options. We use Evernote to collect those options, look at how they work, and
    go back and forth with the graphic designers on possible layouts.”</p><h2><em>Engaging
    the senses</em></h2><p>In <em>Giants of Land and Sea</em>, the theme itself was
    a challenge. “It’s impossible to walk through a redwood forest and not be awed
    by the trees and their size. But that incredible size is hard to communicate in
    a museum gallery,” Tamara says. One way to solve the problem was by displaying
    a cross-section of a redwood tree. But acquiring a specimen was difficult. In
    2017, an 800-year old tree fell during a winter storm in Prairie Creek Redwoods
    State Park, some 300 miles from San Francisco. The tree blocked a trail, and park
    personnel had to cut a section out of the tree to clear it. “The cross-section
    is about nine feet in diameter; it just towers over you,” Tamara says. “And the
    amazing thing is that piece came from about 150 feet up the trunk of that tree.
    The bottom of the tree was twice the size. There’s no way we could have even gotten
    that into the museum.”</p><p>The Academy’s main exhibit hall is open and full
    of natural light, a contrast to the humid warmth of the rainforest in its 4-story
    glass sphere or the submarine gloom of the aquarium. Children’s voices echo and
    vanish in the background hum, as in a train station. A huge blue whale skeleton
    stretches overhead — it’s always been there, but many visitors never noticed until
    <em>Giants of Land and Sea</em> opened underneath it. Walking through the space,
    a visitor notices not only the size but also how immersive the exhibit is. At
    every turn, screens, flip boards, and other interactive elements beckon a visitor’s
    touch. At one station, pressing a button lights up the same bone in two different
    marine mammal skeletons, along with a human arm model for comparison. <em>See</em>,
    it seems to say, <em>we’re all related</em>.</p><p>“We try to incorporate as much
    interactivity as we can and engage all the senses,” Tamara says. From a chilly
    room full of fog to a virtual ascent through an old-growth redwood grove, every
    part of the exhibit invites people to connect with the things they see. But that
    interactivity also takes into account the changing expectations of the audience.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/11668/1*50N8Y-aA3as-tAsAf3OqAg.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>“In the in the past few years, everybody has become accustomed to
    having devices in their pockets that give them access to all the information they
    could ever want,” Tamara notes. “We have the opportunity to help them navigate
    that information. We try to be thoughtful about not just having one touch screen
    after another because that’s not a novel experience. We use technology to give
    people experiences that are different from what they could find sitting on their
    couch at home.”</p><p>It’s all about getting visitors excited in ways that persist
    after they leave the museum. “Healthy oceans, healthy forests, beautiful places,
    those are things that people appreciate. But these are also things that are essential
    to our future,” Tamara says. “So we hope visitors give some thought to the choices
    they make in their lives. What can you do in your community, in your workplace,
    or in your family to be part of a sustainable future?”</p><h2><em>Getting involved
    with “citizen science”</em></h2><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/a3e25eebe2bb9f7fb7e93753e26c6827"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>Getting people directly engaged and involved is vital,
    and that’s where the Academy’s <a href="https://www.calacademy.org/citizen-science">citizen
    science program</a> comes in. Rebecca Johnson co-leads a small team with a big
    mission. They bring people from all walks of life together to make observations
    and discover what’s happening on a local level.</p><p>Rebecca says the citizen
    science movement is open to anyone who cares about the natural world, wants to
    know more, and wants to make a difference. “We can all be curious,” she says.
    “Everybody can share in that awe and wonder of discovery.”</p><p>Through “bio-blitz”
    meetups and the global <a href="https://www.calacademy.org/citizen-science/city-nature-challenge">City
    Nature Challenge</a> event, participants get outside and document what they see
    using <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>, a free app. A typical
    event can generate thousands of observations covering hundreds of species. The
    data, indexed and organized automatically, can be used by researchers to create
    a snapshot of a local ecosystem. It also reveals how a location has changed over
    time.</p><p>“It’s locally relevant and it’s globally relevant,” Rebecca says.
    “Especially at this time, where things are changing really quickly, to know where
    things are found is important. This knowledge helps us understand big patterns
    of biodiversity and how they’re changing. But we can’t get the kind of data at
    the scale we need without people everywhere making and sharing observations.”</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/11668/1*torCm-wK4mgPR61-sIAwJQ.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>It also helps people connect with the world in a new way. “Take
    time to walk somewhere outside if you can,” Rebecca says. “Pay attention and see
    what you might see. You’ll start to notice patterns, notice trends, just because
    you’re paying attention a little more.”</p><h2><em>Making connections, building
    a community</em></h2><p>Exhibits and bio-blitzes are two ways the California Academy
    of Sciences fulfills its mission. But that ethos extends to every aspect of its
    existence. Even the Academy building itself, opened in 2008, is designed to be
    at harmony with the surrounding landscape. Its living roof supports native plants,
    pollinators, and local bird populations.</p><p>“When people come here, we hope
    they’re going to make connections,” Tamara says. “As they’re walking through our
    rainforest, for example, they might think, ‘oh, I never realized that my coffee
    comes from plants in the rainforest.’”</p><p>Looking ahead, Tamara sees further
    opportunities to help people make those connections. She points to the multilingual
    design of <em>Giants of Land and Sea</em> as a model for the future. “<em>Giants</em>
    is presented in four languages: English, Spanish, Chinese, and Filipino. It’s
    a way for us to celebrate not only biodiversity but also to welcome the cultural
    diversity of California and engage a broader audience.”</p><p>Rebecca agrees:
    “I hope that one of the things that we’re doing is building a community of advocates
    for science. I like the idea that I can like help build a more science-literate
    society. I like people seeing that their observations are worthwhile, and that
    science is meaningful and important to protect.”</p><p>Rebecca stresses that we
    can connect with nature no matter where we live. When we do that, we learn more
    about ourselves, our place in the world, and our responsibility as a species.
    But it all begins with discovery. And for the California Academy of Sciences,
    inspiring people to focus on the planet’s natural wonders is what matters most.</p><p><img

  :title: Poor citation practices are a form of academic self-harm in the humanities
    and social sciences
  :content: '<p>There is a huge gulf between many STEM scientists (in science, technology,
    engineering and mathematics) and scholars in other disciplines in how often they
    cite other people’s research in explaining their own findings and arguments. My
    first chart shows that the citation rate (defined as total citations divided by
    the number of publications)is eight times greater in medical and life sciences
    than in the humanities (including law and ‘art’ subjects here). In the ‘natural’
    sciences (i.e the STEM disciplines minus life sciences) the citation rate is six
    times greater than in the humanities.</p><p><strong>Figure 1: Differences in the
    average aggregate citation rates between major groups of disciplines, (that is,
    total citations divided by number of publications) in 2006</strong></p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2354/1*qtlt49qZHb4BgQMJnkpRSw.png" alt=""></p><p><em>Source:
    Centre for Science and Technology Studies (2007).</em></p><p>The social sciences
    as a discipline group are in somewhat better shape than the humanities, with citation
    rates just beating engineering, the subjects in the large overlap areas between
    STEM and social science, and information/language studies. Nonetheless the citation
    rate for natural sciences is twice that in the social sciences, and for life sciences
    more than 2.5 times as great.</p><p>When we turn to looking at academic journals,
    the gulf in citation practices is even bigger. Traditionally social scientists
    and even more humanities scholars have tended to dismiss journal-citation results
    derived from the proprietary bibliographic databases like the Web of Science and
    Scopus, and they had legitimate grounds for doing so. Until very recently Web
    of Science completely ignored academic books as sources of citations, although
    they are very important across the humanities and ‘soft’ social sciences. Its
    coverage of journals also varied sharply across discipline groups, from 90%+ in
    particle physics or astronomy (a strong base for analysis) down to 35–40% for
    the social sciences (a poor basis for any analysis) and below 20% for the humanities
    (a hopeless basis). Scopus was a bit better in including books, but its inclusion
    basis was similarly restricted outside the STEM disciplines. Both these old-established,
    science-biased databases have recently begun trying to get better at covering
    the humanities and social sciences (with WoS trying to cover books for instance),
    but they have a huge amount of ground to make up still.</p><p>However, the “we
    can’t be compared with STEM” defense has crumbled away from another angle, with
    the rapid development of Google Scholar Metrics. These measures of citations look
    across all sources very evenly (covering journal articles, books, research reports
    and conference papers) and their cite counts are very inclusive of journals across
    all the discipline groups. Google also uses excellent indicators of journals’
    average citing rates, giving the h score for each journal for the last five years
    (the h5 index) — where an h5 score of 20 shows that 20 articles have been cited
    20 times. They also include the number of cites in the last five years for the
    median article included in the journal’s h5 score, a measure which is called the
    h5 median. Google’s h5 index and h5 median are robust and meaningful average indicators,
    and they contrast starkly with the thoroughly discredited ‘journal impact factor
    (JIF)’, still trumpeted by some mathematically ignorant journal publishers.</p><p>My
    second chart shows these Google metrics for the topmost journals in each discipline
    group, and (because this may be an exceptional score) for the journals that are
    ranked at number 20 in each group. There are huge differences here, with the top
    scoring medical and life sciences journals getting h5 scores that are nine times
    larger than top humanities journals, four times those of other social sciences,
    and twice those of business and economics.</p><p><strong>Figure 2: How Google’s
    metrics vary across discipline groups, for the top journal (blue) and the 20th
    ranked journal (orange)</strong></p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*MT5_4jN1bRe_hQvSEGg6nA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>At the 20th ranked journal in each discipline group the absolute
    range of these scores narrows, but the picture stays pretty much the same as the
    Figure shows. The medical journal ranked 20th still has five times the h5 score
    of its humanities counterpart, and two and a half times that of its social sciences
    counterpart. And remember these are h5 scores that are very resilient indicators
    anyway, very unsusceptible to distortion. So the gulf charted here isn’t the product
    of just a few science super-journals.</p><p>And it doesn’t get better when you
    look at the details. For example:</p><ul><li><p>the top scoring journals in English
    literature and literary studies generally have h5 scores of around 10</p></li><li><p>in
    history only two journals make it to h5 scores of 20</p></li><li><p>and in political
    science again only two journals achieve h5 scores of 50.</p></li></ul><h3>What
    should or can be done?</h3><p>I’ve participated in a great many discussions among
    social scientists about low citation rates. Typically most people in these conversations
    treat the issue as of minor significance, indicative only of the myriad external
    academic cultures that form such a mystery to us, enmeshed as we all are within
    our single-silo perspectives. The greater volume of STEM science publications
    is cited as if it explains things — it doesn’t, most individual STEM science papers
    are not often cited. And thorough or comprehensive referencing is usually pictured
    as a kind of compulsive behavior by scientists, a hoop-jumping formality often
    carried to excess. It is rare indeed to hear any social scientist who recognizes
    the extent or importance of the search work that STEM researchers must undertake
    every week, just to keep abreast of their field and a rapidly evolving literature.</p><p>I
    have had fewer discussions with humanities scholars, although senior figures there
    seem to take a similar stance. The sheer rarity of cross-citing and the general
    absence of cumulation especially galls some young academics, but there is no developed
    sense that anything different could or should ever happen. Indeed some despairing
    observers have concluded that in fields like literary studies we should <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Research-Bust/129930/">abandon
    the current emphasis upon undertaking research</a> altogether, since most of this
    work will never be referenced or seen as of any provable value by other scholars
    in the field.</p><p>Yet citation and referencing patterns are not trivial things.
    The patterns charted above are not just a filigree of external appearances that
    dangles around disciplines without any connection to the seriousness and purposefulness
    of their fundamental activities. On the contrary Figure 3 below shows that how
    we cite and reference other work relates back closely and integrally to how we
    practice science and scholarship. Full and accurate citations are not a ritualistic
    or optional extra that we can dispense with at will, nice to have if you’ve got
    time or a research assistant on your side, but a bit of a chore otherwise. They
    are instead a solid and important indications of the presence of the seven primary
    academic virtues listed in the leftmost column of Figure 3.</p><p><strong>Figure
    3: How seven main features of scientific and scholarly work are reflected in referencing
    and citations</strong></p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2722/1*lF1pvKk7xrggRn3m_Q9VhQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Source: Patrick Dunleavy and Jane Tinkler, <em>Improving the Impacts
    of University Research</em>, Palgrave, forthcoming.</p><p>It follows that those
    social science and humanities academics who go through life anxious to prove themselves
    a ‘source’ (of citations) but not a ‘hub’ (of cites to others) are not practicing
    the reputation-building skills that they fondly imagine. Similarly a scholar who
    cites other people’s work only if it agrees with theirs, or who sifts the literature
    in an ideologically-limited or in a discipline-siloed way, ignoring other views,
    perspectives and contra-indications from the evidence, is just a poorer researcher.
    Their practice is self-harming not just to themselves, but to all who read their
    works or follow after them as students at any level. Others who perhaps accept
    such attitudes without practicing them themselves - for example, as departmental
    colleagues or journal reviewers - are also failing in their scholarly obligations,
    albeit in a minor way.</p><p>To break past such attitudes requires a collective
    effort in the social sciences and humanities, by all of us, to get better at understanding
    and summarizing the existing literatures on the myriad topics that we cover. There
    are now numerous tools for doing so. The now-continuous aggregation and re-aggregation
    of scientific and scholarly knowledge via social media — especially <a href="https://medium.com/p/shorter-better-faster-free-fb74bddaec03/edit">academic
    blogging</a> — is one key area of innovation, allowing all of us to keep in scope
    a wider and more up to date range of debates than ever before. Technical developments
    in search — most recently such as<a href="http://scholar.google.co.uk/intl/en/scholar/citations.html#updates">
    Google Scholar Updates</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en">Metrics</a>
    — have made keeping in touch with specialist areas far easier.</p><p>There are
    also now some very specific and increasingly influential methods for re-aggregating
    and re-understanding what whole literatures tell us. ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review">Systematic
    review</a>’ is an especially key approach now across the social sciences, spreading
    in from medicine and the health sciences. It starts by the reviewer clearly delineating
    (i) the subject, focus and boundaries of the review; and (ii) explicit criteria
    to be applied in evaluating sources and texts as being high value, medium value
    or low value. The review begins by considering the full pool of sources, leaving
    nothing out. The reviewer then systematically applies the criteria already set
    out, filtering down the studies progressively to focus on the higher value materials.
    Within the high value studies alone, those with the best evidence or methods employed,
    the systematic review considers what exactly are the strength of any evidential
    connections made and tries to reconcile as far as possible any divergences in
    estimating effects across the high value studies. Finally the conclusions (a)
    sum up the central findings; (b) make clear and assess the level of evidence and
    weight of the materials underpinning the findings; (c) give a sensitivity analysis
    of how far the conclusions might differ if the assessment criteria used for focusing
    down on key studies had been different.</p><p>Compared to systematic review, many
    current literature reviews undertaken in the social sciences and humanities are
    just plainly inadequate — they make little or no effort to be comprehensive; they
    operate on implicit, obscure, varying or inconsistently applied criteria; and
    they culminate in judgements that can often seem personal to the point of idiosyncracy.
    None of this is to say that we should pick up methods unadapted or in formulaic
    fashion from the STEM sciences. We need to adapt systematic review (and other
    approaches) to the social sciences and humanities, especially to handle qualitative
    research and analyses. But <a href="http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book227875">some
    progress</a> has already been made here, and far more can be anticipated as we
    move into a new era of more cumulation and re-aggregation of academic research.</p><p>By
    improving our currently poor to very poor citation and referencing practices in
    the social sciences and humanities we can begin to reverse the collective self-harm
    inherent in the status quo. But far larger gains will also follow as better citation
    practices allow us to strengthen each of the seven distinctive features of academic
    knowledge considered in Figure 3 above.</p><p><em>Some related information for

  :title: 'Johannes Kepler: Understanding Science''s Greatest Anti-Hero'
  :content: '<p>The genius that reshaped the universe, and the murder that defined
    his journey.</p><p>It seems as though trendy fiction today is saturated with the
    broody, nuanced, nearly-villainous leading characters.</p><p>Walter White, Tyrion
    Lannister, Mystique, Alexander Hamilton, Sherlock Holmes (the Cumberbatch version)—
    it’s not a tough list to pull together. We like seeing characters who are self-serving,
    make morally-gray decisions, and triumph in the end at the cost of great personal
    sacrifice. These are geniuses who see the world from revolutionary, new angles
    and will stop at nothing to make their visions a reality.</p><p>It’s sexy. It’s
    dramatic. It’s Johannes Kepler, the 17th Century astronomer.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vgxs_9ocWZwgmLUSGqCCLQ.jpeg"
    alt="What a sly dude."><em>What a sly dude.</em></p><p>Kepler was broody AF.</p><p>Since
    an early age <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=WQZ78_u7vYYC&dq=heavenly+intrigue&source=gbs_navlinks_s">Kepler
    considered himself to be hazardously unlucky</a>. He was beaten by his father
    — a mercenary who abandoned the family—and in his youth was <a href="https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201407/physicshistory.cfm">later
    stricken with a severe case of smallpox that crippled his hands and eyesight</a>.
    Through the misfortune, though, Kepler learned to look towards the paths of the
    stars and planets in hopes of understanding the chaotic, dismal world beneath
    his feet. Astrology, horoscopes, and star-charts became an early obsession.</p><p>He
    learned all this from his mother — a spiritual woman in her own right who allegedly
    sparked this inspiration in a young Johannes <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=665">by
    taking him to see a comet at the age of five</a>.</p><p>That mother (spoiler alert)
    would <a href="http://theconversation.com/the-astronomer-and-the-witch-how-kepler-saved-his-mother-from-the-stake-49332">later
    be charged for witchcraft</a> and Kepler would have to mount her defense in court.

    show the nested orbits of the planets arranged inside Platonic Solids. It took
    him a while to start getting things right.</em></p><p>Through the trauma, Kepler
    emerged as an absolutely brilliant kid. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=y2cfBQAAQBAJ&dq=kepler+loved+puzzles&source=gbs_navlinks_s">He
    loved puzzles and jokes</a>, but found himself isolated during early schooling
    due to his constant illness. Apparently since childhood he <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=WQZ78_u7vYYC&dq=heavenly+intrigue&source=gbs_navlinks_s">compiled
    a list of enemies</a> and rivals, a habit he’d remain fond of through later life
    as well. To add a splash more eccentricity, he’d recount this through journals
    written in the third person:</p><blockquote><p>“From the beginning of his life
    this man had many enemies,” <em>wrote Johannes Kepler in his autobiographical
    notes, titled <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6085972">***Self-Analysis</a></em>*</p></blockquote><p>Kepler
    found himself with an almost immediate talent for mathematics and geometry, but
    given his fascination with the Godly forces that shaped his life on earth, <a
    href="https://www.nasa.gov/kepler/education/johannes">he dreamed of joining the
    Lutheran Church as a minister</a>. To Kepler, math and science were not at odds
    with religious doctrine — he viewed the two as halves of a whole, both necessary
    ingredients in better answering questions about his fate in the world.</p><p>The
    Church had other plans.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*4t1Qc9g5Skviy1YRlxom-g.jpeg"

    with religious doctrine."><em>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War">**Thirty
    Years War</a></em>* came later during Johannes Kepler’s life, but he had lived
    in the crosshairs of the brewing feud ever since his first publications, when
    he found himself at odds with religious doctrine.*</p><p>Keep in mind, this was
    the late 1500s. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus">Nicolaus
    Copernicus</a> had died over 60 years prior and his model for a sun-centric solar
    system had been largely written off as a clever thought-experiment, but nothing
    more. Kepler was one of the few budding astronomers who thought there was truth
    to these ideas — what if the earth actually <em>did</em> revolve around the sun?</p><p>Europe
    had been on the brink of religious war for years, but both sides still agreed
    that changing our model of the solar system was bad news bears. Kepler’s early
    <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/copernicus/">adoration of the Copernican
    Model</a> caused him to be ousted from any future involvement with the clergy.
    Math was his backup, and Kepler’s unique stance in the narrow overlap between
    religion and natural law put him in the crosshairs of aggression from both sides.</p><p>And
    this is when things get wild.</p><p>At the <strong>very end</strong> of the 16th
    Century — literally New Years Eve, 1599, if you can imagine that perfect storytelling
    — Johannes Kepler reached rock bottom. He was a district mathematician working
    in Graz, a University city in the Holy Roman Empire, but found himself hounded
    by tax collectors and under constant threat of disownment by his father in law,
    a noble mill-owner named Jobst Müller who hated Kepler for literally all the reasons.
    He had found the bottom of the barrel.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*zfkmRh42au4Twnb2vwy_dg.jpeg"
    alt="And he allegedly had an affair with The Queen of Denmark. What a stud."><em>And

    Tycho Brahe!</p><p>This was a man who got his nose chopped off in a duel and replaced

    acuity, Brahe had it in spades. He had reached near-celebrity status by cozying
    up to European rulers who would fund his elaborate astronomical endeavors — as
    a result, he had amassed <a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/finding-our-place-in-the-cosmos-with-carl-sagan/articles-and-essays/modeling-the-cosmos/whose-revolution-copernicus-brahe-and-kepler">the
    world’s largest</a> (at the time) library of celestial data, but he hit a roadblock
    in proving his new “Tychonic Model” of the solar system to be any better than
    Copernicus’s. He knew that partnering with a genius upstart mathematician like
    Kepler would be the key to making history.</p><p>He and Kepler, famously, did
    not get along. When Kepler refused to help on the Tychonic research in favor of
    developing his own theories, Brahe shut him out. The library of data was kept
    behind locked doors and out of Kepler’s reach, just as he found himself closer
    than ever to the celestial answers he’d searched for his whole life.</p><p><a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe">Tycho Brahe died suddenly just
    months later in October, 1601.</a></p><p>What happened next was a domino effect
    that would solidify Johannes Kepler as a founder of modern astronomy — he gained
    access to Brahe’s data, published his seminal work, and rewrote Europe’s understanding
    of science, physics, and the universe.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vFoOxHRTfQri_w9ffL5CNw.gif"

    for crying out loud!</em></p><p>But his story doesn’t stop there — for the years
    to follow, Kepler sat in the crosshairs of one of history’s most treacherous unsolved
    murders, all the while dodging persecution from the Catholic Church who viewed
    his beliefs as heresy. He would eventually go on to redefine Calendar Law (<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption_of_the_Gregorian_calendar">it’s a
    thing</a>), write the world’s first science-fiction novel, publish the early precursors

    over the next few months, flushing out the background of his life, his world,
    and the people who shaped his narrative. Kepler lived in Europe during an era

  :title: Guiding the Evolution of Cultural Sciences
  :content: <p>A simulation of growth in a petri dish… see here for how it was made.</p><p>We
    are living in a world where <em>holistic, systemic crises</em> threaten the future
    of humanity. And yet, there has been an historic pattern of fragmentation in the
    physical and social sciences needed to tackle them. I have taken on the life mission
    to guide the evolution of cultural sciences so that they become fully integrated
    with the dynamics 0f our changing Earth.</p><p>The 20th Century saw the rise of
    many different academic disciplines — anthropology, archeology, economics, history,
    psychology, philosophy, political science, and sociology — with very little clarity
    about where one field begins and the other ends. In parallel with this, there
    has been an explosion of new research fields exploring the digital humanities,
    human ecology, urban studies, and the inherent patterns of complex systems writ
    large.</p><p>As we grapple with intensifying climate change, rapid depletion of
    top soils around the world, growing wealth inequality, increasingly decentralized
    and corrupted media ecosystems, and exponential technologies like artificial intelligence
    and bioengineering — it is vital that we take stock of all that is already known
    and quickly integrate the pieces into holistic insights capable of tracking the
    changes as they unfold.</p><p>Nowhere on Earth is anyone doing this in earnest.
    I should know because seven years ago I was part of the team trying to lay the
    groundwork for the 120 sciences of the Earth System as part of the <a href="http://icesfoundation.org/Pages/Home.aspx">International
    Centre for Earth Simulation</a> (ICES). At the time, that was the most ambitious
    effort I could find for doing this work. Built on the three pillars of <em>high-performance
    computing, modeling and simulation, and scientific visualization</em> we were
    attempting to build a billion dollar research center dedicated to this vital integration
    work.</p><p>While ICES continues to develop in slow progression, another effort
    is now underway that I have taken the lead on — birthing the <a href="https://culturalevolutionsociety.org/">Cultural
    Evolution Society</a> (CES) with the mission to integrate biology with all of
    the social sciences and humanities. We currently have roughly 2,000 researchers
    on our mailing list from more than 400 universities in 54 countries around the
    world. Our first conference will be in a few weeks at the <a href="https://www.shh.mpg.de/cescjena2017">Max
    Planck Institute for the Science of Human History</a> in Jena, Germany.</p><p>I
    share this because the guided evolution of social science integration will require
    bridge-building between biology, culture, and ecology. Much groundwork has been
    laid for this grand synthesis but time is short and it will likely take several
    decades to bring it to completion. Sadly, humanity doesn’t have the luxury of
    this much time. We have <a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/earth-has-crossed-several-planetary-boundaries-thresholds-human-induced-environmental-changes">already
    crossed</a> at least four of the nine planetary boundaries that define a safe
    operating range for global civilization. <strong>In other words, we are quickly
    moving into “overshoot-and-collapse” as a planetary species and time is running
    out.</strong></p><p>Read on to learn what we are setting out to do with the field
    of cultural evolution.</p><h2>Merging Science with the Humanities</h2><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Ovm1pdf8p991HP13.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Historical
    datasets are the “fossil records” for cultural evolution. They are very important!
    Whether in literature or the arts, humanities researchers hold the key to this
    massive body of knowledge.</p><p>Unfortunately, the tensions between science and
    humanities are deeply entrenched. Few scholars have bridged across the numerous
    historic divides. We see our mission of knowledge synthesis as a call to weave
    the many tools of cultural and social research with the arts and humanities —
    a two-way street where each side has much to learn from the other.</p><p>This
    <a href="https://evolution-institute.org/article/the-riddle-and-the-range-of-art/">interview</a>
    between David Sloan Wilson and Brian Boyd offers a glimpse of what evolution can
    offer the arts. It is merely the tip of an iceberg that we can thoroughly explore
    together in the years to come. Clearly there is a great deal of work to be done
    here.</p><p>Several CES members have already expressed a desire to work closely
    with the digital humanities. Projects like the <a href="http://seshatdatabank.info/">Seshat
    World History Databank</a> provide one such bridge, yet many more will be needed.</p><h2>A
    Century of Divided Social Sciences</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*YeWaXzh5rYILsZzm.jpg"
    alt=""></p><p>It is fascinating to learn that evolutionary thinking failed to
    take hold in both <a href="https://evolution-institute.org/article/cultural-anthropology-and-cultural-evolution-tear-down-this-wall-a-conversation-with-robert-paul/">cultural
    anthropology</a> and <a href="https://evolution-institute.org/article/why-did-sociology-declare-independence-from-biology-and-can-they-be-reunited-an-interview-with-russell-schutt/">sociology</a>
    for similar historic reasons. A careful study of this history will be necessary
    if we are to see the emergence of a unified and coherent social sciences in the
    21st Century.</p><p>If we are to achieve a “grand synthesis” of biology and society
    (as I’ve written about <a href="https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/the-grand-synthesis-of-biology-and-society-df21147cc2c8#.4ylmbrq8v">here</a>),
    we will need to understand why the divisions exist and where they came from in
    the first place.</p><p>Many institutional factors will also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/palcomms201636">need
    to be addressed</a> — how to fund interdisciplinary efforts; the challenge of
    jargon as a linguistic barrier to collaboration; career incentives at odds with
    integrative approaches; problems with peer-review publications; to name a few.</p><p>Again,
    we really have our work cut out for us. Yet I remain inspired by the incredible
    diversity of CES members and the interest expressed in tackling these issues together.</p><h2>Creating
    Field Sites for Social Change</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*iLya1mfBK8tIafe6.png"
    alt=""></p><p>A potentially world-changing idea is that <strong><em>every place
    where social change occurs can become a “field site” for cultural evolution research.</em></strong>
    This is beautifully articulated in a series of lead articles by Harvey Whitehouse
    and David Sloan Wilson as it applies to <a href="https://evolution-institute.org/focus-article/developing-the-field-site-concept-for-the-study-of-cultural-evolution-an-anthropologists-view/">anthropology</a>
    and <a href="https://evolution-institute.org/focus-article/developing-the-field-site-concept-for-the-study-of-cultural-evolution-an-evolutionary-biologists-view/">biology</a>.</p><p>The
    field site concept has also proven invaluable in fields like <a href="https://evolution-institute.org/commentary/on-field-sites-for-the-study-of-cultural-evolution/">archeology</a>,
    <a href="https://evolution-institute.org/commentary/defining-and-implementing-field-sites-in-cultural-evolution-science/">cross-cultural
    psychology,</a> and <a href="https://evolution-institute.org/commentary/developing-the-field-site-concept-for-the-study-of-cultural-evolution-a-sociologists-perspective/">sociology</a>.
    Together we will explore the many variations for how field work is combined with
    lab studies and theoretical modeling.</p><p>Several CES members have expressed
    concerns about the ethics and politics of applied cultural evolution work. As
    we build up a community of knowledge and practice with field sites, we will have
    ample opportunity to explore these vital threads further.</p><p>This is another
    major area to discuss and debate, experiment with and test in the years ahead.
    Groundwork will need to be laid out in 2017 for this larger effort.</p><h2>Mapping
    the State of the Field</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*N0s8Pq3Z7lgZ19kv.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>Cultural evolutionary studies is a dynamic and rapidly changing
    field. We will continue mapping out the community assets to reveal patterns and
    discover opportunities for making progress.</p><p>There are hundreds of related
    professional associations, research centers, academic programs, philanthropic
    institutions, publications, and so forth spread around the world. Special issues
    (like <a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/220/1?current-issue=y">this one</a>
    on the evolution of social behavior in the Journal of Experimental Biology) pop
    up on a regular basis. Collections of talks recorded as YouTube videos arise from
    time to time as well (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGJm1x3XQeK2SVhmg1c9SlQ3QwjPMLdgC">this
    one</a> from a recent symposium on biology and culture)</p><p>We will continue
    to curate announcements for meetings and workshops, trainings and conferences,
    grants and job openings as you send them our way. Scanning social media is another
    way that we are discovering what is happening in the field, as many of you tweet
    and blog about gatherings and new published works.</p><p>I described the challenge
    of tracking and absorbing the huge amounts of knowledge in a <a href="https://www.kosmosjournal.org/article/the-predicament-of-knowledge-a-challenge-for-culture-design/">recent
    article</a> — this struggle to keep up with the “information deluge” is only going
    to increase with time.</p><h2>Embracing Animal Behavior</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*c9OjdNPO4Ohu7QHO.jpg"
    alt=""></p><p>A great deal of research has been done on the social behaviors of
    different animals. It will be crucial that we actively promote synergies across
    these efforts as we also go about the work of studying <em>human</em> cultural
    evolution.</p><p><a href="http://news.artsci.utoronto.ca/all-news/research/monkeys-play-odds-making-decisions-based-probabilities/">This
    study</a> of the way capuchin monkeys make decisions using probabilities (by Daphna
    Buchsbaum and and Emma Tecwyn) is one example out of hundreds that could be mentioned.
    A balance needs to be struck between the needed emphasis on the social sciences
    and humanities — mentioned above — and the broader integrative work that spans
    the rest of biology.</p><p>Care was taken to recruit animal behavior researchers
    to our Executive Committee. But this is merely the beginning of what will likely
    be a long road to travel. Providing supports for synergies across animal behavior
    studies will be a significant task in its own right.</p><h2>Trainings, Tools,
    and Libraries</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Mc1T0slx6T7E94wM.jpg"
    alt=""></p><p>The field of cultural evolution is so rich and diverse that a proper
    effort will be needed to map out its knowledge ecology. There are hundreds of
    books, thousands of research articles, dozens of research centers, and numerous
    ways to begin learning about the science of biological and social change.</p><p>Workshops
    are routinely offered (like this one at the Max Planck Institute in Jena on <a
    href="http://www.shh.mpg.de/304502/quantitative-methods-spring-school-2017">quantitative
    methods for the study of language evolution</a>) that students will be interested
    in. Educational consortiums exist (<a href="http://evostudies.org/">EvoS</a> being
    a well-known example) to develop curricula and share teaching practices across
    universities. Yet there remains an absence of curated and easily navigated training
    materials for the field as a whole.</p><p>With so many tools to use, areas of
    knowledge to learn about, and possible pathways for career development, it will
    be helpful to have “platform” solutions that enable these resources to be aggregated,
    curated, and accessed in a usable manner.</p><p>This is another area where CES
    will have its work cut out for it. Our goal this year is simply to get started
    and see how far we can go on what promises to be a long journey.</p><h2>Next Steps
    — Toward A Grand Synthesis</h2><p>It is an exciting time to be an interdisciplinary
    scholar. But it is a scary and dangerous time too. We will become capable of <a

    cultural change</a> in the midst of crisis* when the tools, frameworks, research
    areas, and learning processes are directed toward holistic insights.</p><p>We

    with disruptions and rapid evolution for technologies, political breakdown and
    succession, economic transformation, and more. Being prepared will require new
    practices, institutional structures, and modes of cooperation than those available
    today.</p><p>Underlying all of this will be a move toward the “grand synthesis”
    of knowledge acquired collectively by humanity in the last five hundred years.
    We will need to form strategic alliances between funding agencies and philanthropic
    foundations; forge collaborative trainings and workshops among researchers in
    networks of social learning across universities and nonprofit research institutes;

  :content: '<p>The limits of quantitative data are exposed while our biases remain
    buried deep.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2778/1*CdRFIU7-4hZ8ZWxM0awB7w.jpeg"
    alt="What if Margaret Mead had worked with today’s pollsters? (Image: History.com)"><em>What
    if Margaret Mead had worked with today’s pollsters? (Image: History.com)</em></p><p>The
    most disappointing aspect of this election might not be what our President-elect
    has said about The Underrepresented.</p><p>It’s what millions of voters secretly
    believe but aren’t willing, or comfortable, to admit: that they have some level
    of tolerance, if not full embrace, of discriminatory practices with gender, race,
    and citizenry. For the record, this applies to all education levels (e.g. 45%
    of college-educated white women voted Trump, while 62% of non-college-educated
    white women did the same).</p><p>Why were the election projections so, so far
    off? It could be that the scientific underpinnings and methodology of polling
    is afoul. Or, it could also be that people simply lied in their responses to protect
    themselves — from their friends/family’s “politically correct” ire, and from their
    own id.</p><p>But wait. Polls are anonymous. Why would someone lie on an anonymous
    poll?</p><h3>Oh, <em>That</em> Nutella?</h3><p>Years ago I worked at <a href="undefined">IDEO</a>,
    a firm known for human-centered design rooted in ethnographic research. One of
    Margaret Mead’s famous points — “*What people say, what people do, and what they
    say they do are entirely different things” — *came to life with surprising frequency.</p><p>When
    designing a snack product for a consumer food client, IDEO researchers asked a
    number of participants to keep daily journals of their food consumption. They
    followed up with a select few, visiting research participants at their home and
    work. While one subject walked the team through her work space — family pictures,
    ergonomic set-up, etc — they saw a jar of Nutella in one of her desk drawers.
    She hadn’t made any mention of it in her journal.</p><blockquote><p>“Oh that?
    [Laughing] Yeah, I sneak a spoonful every now and again,” she said.</p></blockquote><p>So
    why didn’t she just put that highly relevant fact in her journal? Perhaps she
    didn’t want to admit it to herself, and writing it down would be definitive step
    in that direction? Maybe it just helped her, personally, to hide the fact that
    she behaves in a way she’s not proud of, or in theoretical agreement with. Possibly
    just a case of cognitive dissonance.</p><blockquote><h1>The tale of our election
    mis-forecasting just might be that: a cognitive dissonance so deep and sophisticated
    that raw numbers simply don’t tell the whole story, and worse, pervert the story
    itself.</h1></blockquote><p>Complex issues — like grappling with the historic,
    tortured choice some voters faced this November — might need equally sophisticated
    research techniques next time around. We might need our data scientists and pollsters
    to partner up with anthropologists and ethnographers to provide a contextual view
    for the data. It might also be helpful for quantitative folks to get a feel for
    the human numbers they’re crunching. <em>[Update: In doing so they might have
    also realized that an overwhelming number of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/revenge-of-the-forgotten-class">older,
    first-time voters</a> were going to turn out — and could have changed their models
    accordingly.]</em></p><p>While pollsters aren’t designers aiming to create things,
    they might learn something from hybrid research, which combines the quantitative
    and the qualitative. <a href="undefined">Johannes Seemann</a> sums it up below.</p><iframe
    src="https://medium.com/media/5102835d6e606723c011ab56802b7dbe" frameborder=0></iframe><p>I’ve
    been reading reflections and solutions to some of the reasons we’re here today
    — <a href="undefined">Anil Dash</a>, <a href="undefined">Dave Pell</a>, <a href="undefined">danah
    boyd</a>, <a href="undefined">Jennifer Pahlka</a>, <a href="undefined">Jeff Jarvis</a>
    — and while I <a href="https://points.datasociety.net/media-end-reporting-on-polls-c9b5df705b7f#.yl2iekfec">don’t
    agree</a> with all of them, I applaud the effort to move forward constructively.
    So I’m chipping in my own with this piece for pollsters.</p><p>However, and this
    is a big one, it’s hard to deny the horrific, massive undercurrent of racism,
    misogyny, and xenophobia that is being born out in the data. The truly terrifying
    part is that many Trump-voters don’t know that they’re likely racist, sexist,
    and afraid of the other. And they can’t take the steps to move past it if they
    don’t confront it.</p><p>Unlike many of the pundits I’ve been reading the past
    48 hours, I actually do have friends who supported Trump for a wide range of reasons.
    All of them disavowed his “diarrhea of the mouth” and classified his terrible
    words/actions with the following: <em>“I’m willing to overlook that in order to
    [fill in the blank: drain the swamp, boost the economy, secure a conservative
    SCOTUS, etc.].”</em></p><p>I just don’t know how you can overlook those statements
    without making an unknown, deep-down assessment and complicit acceptance of them.
    <em>[If Trump supporters had outright rejected and denounced his musings, perhaps
    I wouldn’t have written this post in the first place. But many of us are *</em>still**
    waiting for Trump supporters to do this <a href="https://medium.com/@jessicashortall/voted-for-trump-i-have-only-one-plea-7d5994c7a3d1#.6bxenl23b">one
    simple thing</a> h/t <a href="undefined">jessicashortall</a>.]*</p><p>Maybe next
    time when pollsters include ethnographers in their research, we’ll get a better
    picture of what’s happening — and start to unearth, and meaningfully grapple with,
    the demons inside.</p>'

    explanation of some popular statistical and Machine Learning methods widely used
    in Life Sciences which sometimes might seem to be intransparent and difficult
    to grasp.</p><h2>Big Data: Astronomical or Genomical?</h2><p>Having my background
    in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics">Theoretical Physics</a>,
    during last 8 years I have been very happy and lucky to work together with people
    from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_life_sciences">Life Sciences</a>
    such as Biomedicine, Cell Biology and Evolutionary Science. Often I heard from
    my colleagues: <strong>“We have Big Data, we need to analyze, integrate it and
    run Machine Learning on it”</strong>. By Big Data my colleagues usually mean <strong>terabytes
    and petabytes of disk space</strong> occupied by various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omics">Omics
    data</a>: genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics etc.</p><p><img

    Stephens et al., Plos Biology 13, e1002195 (2015)"><em>From Stephens et al., Plos
    Biology 13, e1002195 (2015)</em></p><p>Indeed, as human genome <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing">sequencing</a>
    becomes relatively cheap (<strong>~</strong>1000 USD per genome), more and more
    labs at academic universities across the world can afford acquiring whole-genome
    information from <strong>hundreds and thousands of individuals</strong> for answering
    their research questions. Such public resources as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000_Genomes_Project">1000
    Genomes Project</a> (~2 500 human genomes), <a href="http://exac.broadinstitute.org/about">ExAC</a>

    (900+ rare human genomes) provide massive amount of genetic data which currently
    far exceeds the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s
    law</a>.</p><h2>Is it already in the Clinics?</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_medicine">**Precision
    Medicine</a>** greatly benefits from huge genomics efforts such as <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga">The

    alt="The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and UK Biobank are huge human genomics resources"><em>The
    Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and UK Biobank are huge human genomics resources</em></p><p>So
    what kind of question is that “Do we have Big Data in Life Sciences?”. There is
    a temptation to say “Yes, certainly, look at the huge genomics efforts. Now we
    should be able to use the knowledge learnt from genomics data across human populations
    in order to take a random human DNA and <strong>predict whether this person is
    predisposed to certain deceases</strong>, so we should be able to predict the
    future of this individual and prescribe a treatment adjusted to this particular
    individual. Isn’t it what Precision Medicine is supposed to do?”.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Oy8E3huGqZvAY4-aApxMfQ.png"

    Medicine</a> is here to bring treatment adjusted to individual genetic signatures</em></p><p>However,
    it turns out that <strong>to bring these genomics efforts to the Clinics is not
    straightforward</strong>. <a href="https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/principal-investigators/researcher/mark-mccarthy">Prof.
    Mark McCarthy</a> from the University of Oxford, one of the world leading experts
    in genetics of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), gave a few <a href="https://publications.mcgill.ca/humangenetics/files/2017/05/A-McGill-Distinguished-Lecture-in-Human-Genetics.pdf">talks</a>
    last year with the title</p><blockquote><h1>Now we have found over 400 genetic
    signals influencing Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), what on earth are we going to do with
    them?</h1></blockquote><p>This doesn’t sound too optimistic, does it? It basically
    says that we have a lot of data, we use these data for identifying genes related
    to common diseases such as T2D, however we are not close to bringing these genes
    to Clinical Diagnostics for early prediction and prevention of those diseases.</p><h2>Genomics
    predicts poorly</h2><p>So what is the problem, why can’t we use these huge genomics
    efforts in the Clinics? Well, the short answer is <strong>it does not work as
    expected. *<em>More specifically, genetic and genomic data do not predict common
    diseases well enough. A recent evidence of the poor predictive power of genomics
    data for *</em>Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)</strong> was demonstrated by the
    group of <a href="http://snyderlab.stanford.edu/">Mike Snyder</a> from Stanford
    University:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*BTFOMeODu6MNW2pA1iVsIA.png"
    alt="ROC curves for Genomics vs. EHR for AAA from Li et al., Cell **174**, 1361–1372
    (2018)"><em>ROC curves for Genomics vs. EHR for AAA from Li et al., Cell *</em>174*<em>,
    1361–1372 (2018)</em></p><p>The ROC curves above compare the power of <strong>Genomics
    vs. Electronic Health Records (EHR)</strong> for predicting AAA. EHR represents
    quite a trivial clinical information such as height, weight, body temperature,
    blood pressure etc. It turns out that this trivial information is more predictive
    than the genetic variation on the DNA level, which is very frustrating taking
    into account the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078588416001696">large
    genetic component</a> in the AAA phenotype implying that DNA information should
    be predictive, however it is not. This is a typical situation for common diseases
    such as T2D, schizophrenia, cardiovascular disease etc. which is sometimes referred
    to as the problem of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831613/pdf/nihms175346.pdf">**Missing
    Heritability</a>** and simply means that <strong>genomics Big Data can not predict
    common diseases</strong>.</p><h2>The Curse of Dimensionality in Genomics</h2><p>There
    are certainly multiple explanations why genomics has a poor predictive power.
    One of them is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">**the
    curse of dimensionality</a>** that I already mentioned in <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-for-data-integration-46d51601f781">my
    previous post</a>. The curse of dimensionality is the inability to perform meaningful
    mathematics when the number of features, <strong>p</strong>, is much greater than
    the number of samples, <strong>n</strong>, i.e. in the limit <strong>p&gt;&gt;n</strong>.
    Human genome typically contains <strong>p ~ 30 - 90 million genetic mutations</strong>
    (single nucleotide polymorphisms), while sequencing more than <strong>n~1000 -
    10 000 individuals</strong> is not feasible economically for majority of academic
    institutions. Thus genomics research operates in <strong>ultra-high-dimensional
    space</strong>, p&gt;&gt;n. To demonstrate that the math indeed blows up in high
    dimensions, let us consider a simple linear model Y~X, where Y is the phenotype
    of interest (disease) and X is the matrix of genotypes (genetic variation). The
    solution of the linear model can be expressed in closed form via the inverse <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix">variance-covariance matrix</a>
    of genotypes as follows:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*QgJcIm1o2IJCeemGpFeWdg.png"
    alt="The Curse of Dimensionality in Genomics"><em>The Curse of Dimensionality
    in Genomics</em></p><p>Next, the inverse of variance-covariance matrix of genotypes
    is reciprocal to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant">determinant</a>
    of the matrix. If we now increase the dimensionality of our space up to the limit
    p&gt;&gt;n, <strong>features (mutations in our case) become correlated (redundant)</strong>
    since we have a limited number of observations, n, and can not resolve their differences
    in high-dimensions any more. From Linear Algebra we know that determinant of a
    matrix with correlated rows or columns approaches <strong>zero</strong> which
    leads to <strong>divergence (singularity) of the inverse variance-covariance matrix
    of genotypes</strong>. The frustrating thing is that you never know how well your
    features are correlated in high dimensions and therefore how close to singularity
    you are. In the best case your R or Python libraries will throw a “singularity”
    error, in the worst case you will get a result/answer which looks real but in
    fact is completely inflated due to the curse of dimensionality.</p><h2>If not
    Genomics then where is Big Data?</h2><p>Therefore when my colleagues talk about
    Big Data in genomics I think about <strong>how much statistical power we can extract
    from this data</strong> rather than how much disk space it occupies. Ironically
    enough, we can generate petabytes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise">Gaussian
    noise</a> which is absolutely meaningless to analyze. So I usually argue that
    with the current setup, p&gt;&gt;n, it is not straightforward to run robust Machine
    Learning in genomics as <strong>amount of data is still a bottleneck</strong>.</p><p>Now
    we finally came to the question in the title of the post: “Do we have Big Data
    in Life Sciences?”. My answer is yes, but it is not genomics in the current setup
    concentrated on genetic variation, i.e. with mutations as features and genomes
    as statistical observations (samples). However, I see <strong>three areas in Life
    Sciences where we do have Big Data</strong> and therefore can and should run Machine/Deep
    Learning, these areas are:</p><ol><li><p>Single Cell Omics</p></li><li><p>Microscopy
    Imaging</p></li><li><p>Genomics … but with sequences as statistical observations</p></li></ol><p><a
    href="https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-for-single-cell-biology-935d45064438">In
    my previous post</a> I explained why Single Cell biology is ideally suited for
    Machine/Deep Learning. Briefly, it is because of large scale data sets (millions
    of cells) currently being produced in this field. Here, the situation is opposite
    compared to genomics, we have <strong>p~20 000 genes *<em>and *</em>n~1 000 000
    cells</strong>, therefore <strong>n&gt;&gt;p</strong>. <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-on-microscopy-imaging-865b521ec47c">Microscopy
    Imaging</a> does not need to be justified as a Big Data, indeed, automated microscopy
    drowns in tones of image data. Finally, Genomics can still be seen as a Big Data
    with one very important note: *<em>not individual genomes but short sequences
    (reads or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-mer">k-mers</a>) have to be
    considered as statistical observations. *</em>In this way, treating nucleotides
    as features and short sequences along the genome (aka sliding window approach)
    as statistical observations we come to the limit n&gt;&gt;p which is perfect for
    Machine/Deep Learning. To see how it works in practice, please check one of my
    posts where I demonstrate how to use <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-on-ancient-dna-df042dc3c73d">Deep
    Learning on Ancient DNA</a>, which is also genomics data, just ancient genomics.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>In
    this post we have learnt that Genomics data make a lot of promises for Life Sciences,
    Precision Medicine and Health Care. However, <strong>current ways of analyzing
    Genomics suffer from the curse of dimensionality</strong>. This can be avoided
    via reconsidering what we define as features and samples in Genomics. <strong>Single
    Cell Omics and Microscopy Imaging</strong> are two other Big Data directions in
    Life Sciences which are ready for and should be analyzed by Machine/Deep Learning.</p><p>In
    the comments below let me know which analytical methods in Life Sciences seem
    particularly mysterious to you and I will try to address them in this column.

  :title: Science’s Dirty Little Secret
  :content: '<p>Science’s Dirty Little Secret</p><h3>Not all lab rats are the furry
    kind</h3><p>Many years ago, I watched a friend’s science career destroyed by a
    man. She was a young PhD researcher, he was her supervisor. He had a reputation
    for being an aggressive but talented scientist. He also had a reputation for harassing
    his female researchers. During her time as a research student, his marriage hit
    the rocks, and he took an interest in her — one that wasn’t reciprocated. Her
    friend, another of his students, was bullied into keeping silent on the issue.
    Eventually, things degraded to the point that they filed a joint harassment complaint
    against their supervisor.</p><p>The pair fought an uphill battle every step of
    the way. They were told by the heads of department not to discuss the complaint
    publicly in any way. They instructed to stay away from the lab until the complaint
    was dealt with. They had to wait at home, watching their research stipend bleed
    away, watching their work fall behind. It took six months to arrange a hearing.
    According to institutional policy, complaints of this nature had to be dealt with
    within a few weeks. The heads contained their complaint as an internal departmental
    issue, side-stepping this protocol. When the day came, the two young women had
    to sit next to their ex-supervisor, in a room with his colleagues, and recite
    their misgivings. He was reprimanded, they were assigned a new supervisor, and
    they were told to return to work in the same laboratory as their harasser. By
    this point, my friend had already decided to leave. She moved away and restarted
    her academic career in a different city. Her friend persevered. She had to redo
    her entire PhD, only completing it by incurring masses of credit card debt after
    what was left of her funding ran out. I asked them once what advice they had for
    any woman in a similar position, who was thinking of filing a complaint against
    her supervisor. They replied in unison: “Don’t.”</p><p>Why write about this now?
    Last week, playwright and science writer Monica Byrne posted an essay about her
    <a href="http://monicacatherine.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/this-happened/">own experience
    with harassment</a>, later naming Bora Zivkovic as the man responsible. As *Scientific
    American’s *Blog Editor and co-creator of Science Online, he’s a giant in his
    field, and Byrne had bitten her tongue over the incident specifically because
    he had the power to sink her chances of writing for the publisher. So, the narrative
    repeats itself.</p><p>Then as much as now, I don’t know what do about this. My
    focus is on academia, and the problem is not that some men abuse positions of
    power. Sadly this happens in all walks of life. The problem is that the entire
    system is designed in a way that makes this abuse easy. Easy to carry out, and
    easy to get away with. The doctoral system — what should be a training scheme
    for new scientists — is often caricatured as a serfdom. Young researchers work
    long hours for laughable pay. Often they are not employed by the university, nor
    do their enjoy the protections of employees. These PhD researchers can’t, for
    example, sue for constructive dismissal, nor take their case to an industrial
    tribunal.</p><p>These eminently vulnerable people are then placed in the custodianship
    of superiors who personally wield an incredible amount of power over their future.
    Research fields are so specialised that there might be only a few labs in the
    country you can go on to work at. In that small community, it does not take much
    to derail a young scientist’s career.</p><p>If this was not enough, PhD students
    are utterly replaceable compared to a tenured professor or head of department.
    They aren’t even on the payroll. It is easier for an institution to ride roughshod
    over a student’s interests, ignore their complaints or even encourage them to
    leave than it is to discipline a member of the department. For people that pride
    themselves on being smart, academics and scientists have created a system of employment
    which facilitates sexual harassment and abuse.</p><p>When I raise this issue with
    the female scientists I know, every one of them has a story like this, either
    one they experienced directly, or the experiences of their colleagues. You won’t
    see discussion of these challenges, these risks, in any glossy graduate brochure
    though. That’s science’s dirty little secret. Of course, it might not happen to
    you, but if it does, know that there’s probably very little you’ll be able to
    do about it except put up or pack up.</p><p>So again, I wonder what I can do.
    Some time ago, I bought the domain lab-rats.co.uk. I thought that maybe if people
    could share their experiences, they could find support with one another. They
    could even flag certain problem individuals, warn others away from them, pressure
    institutions to take action. I still think it could work, if heavily moderated.
    These discussions are easily holed by libel suits and defamation claims, and false
    accusations would be equally damaging to the site and to the person targeted.
    But if someone wanted to help make Lab Rats happen, I’m still open to the idea.</p><p>In
    the meantime, after several years, I’m finally telling this story. I guess that’s
    my contribution. I don’t expect it will shake academia to the core and instigate
    new, robust systems that protect the interests of young women and men whose only
    crime is an ambition to be a scientist. But sharing this story is one tiny step
    toward a common goal of progress, and after all, isn’t that what science is about?</p>'

  :title: I read a lot and follow politics, economics, data analysis in all its forms,
    social sciences, and…
  :content: <p>The title of this made it worth a look, I don’t pay attention to names
    at that stage of browsing. As soon as I arrived at the article I realized who
    wrote it and that it was not worth the time. The same fantasy world I’ve responded
    to before. As other people note, this is articulate enough to start at the beginning
    and move to a conclusion but is based in an imaginary world that is now so far
    in the past as to be unreachable except in low-grade fantasies.</p><p>But the
    same thing shows up periodically with no response to unanimous critical amazement.
    That raises questions concerning the point of these expositions.</p><p>As one
    responder noted, at first it looks to be satire but quickly becomes clear that
    it isn’t a send-up of Trumpist and retread fascist absurdity. So what is this?
    Another victim of Trump’s social psychosis waiting in line to drink the poison
    Kool-Aid? A pseudo-academic troll embittered by academic infighting dedicated
    to self-destruction?</p><p>Given the questions, I thought a some research was
    in order. Busler appears to actually be on the faculty of Stockton University,
    an average quality school part of the New Jersey state system. The only other
    listing is as a contributor to <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsmax/">Newsmax
    that is a rightwing publication rated as ‘biased and not reliable’.</a> That certainly
    seems consistent. As is often the case now Newsmax seems to be an admirer of if
    not linked to RT, Putin’s international propaganda voice. Funny, bit anything
    tied to Trump almost always has a Russian connection.</p>

  :content: '<p>Science’s Gender Gap Is Hurting Our Future</p><h3>Parents and teachers
    say science is for everyone, then tell girls to “let the boys do it.”</h3><p>Sophie
    — an Education Coordinator at Chicago’s Museum of Science and Industry — was running
    an hour-long laboratory experience for school-aged children when a parent approached
    her. She pointed out her kids — a boy and a girl — then leaned in and whispered,
    “You know, <em>he’s</em> the real scientist in the family.”</p><p>Sophie says
    this happens a lot—that over the course of her career, she’s heard parents, chaperones
    and even teachers declare science is for everyone, then immediately tell the girls
    to “let the boys do it.”</p><p>These are the exact girls she hopes to reach with
    her new web series, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/science-with-sophie-science-comedy-for-girls">“Science

    creatively and be scientists every day.</p><p><center><iframe width="560" height="315"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OICQAVdh3c4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p><p>Growing
    up outside Boston, Sophie rarely saw herself represented in the science TV shows
    she loved. “The only female role model I had was Ms. Frizzle and she was a cartoon,”
    she says.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*8Or_sNo_n5rk6uP2JbnJZg.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>Educational TV has made strides since the “Magic School Bus” days.
    In 2010, PBS debuted “SciGirls,” a show designed to gently push young women to
    pursuing STEM careers. In 2015, Netflix released “Project MC2,” a series about
    four smart girls who use science to bring down bad guys.</p><p>But in the real
    world, gender bias and inequality is still a frustratingly ubiquitous issue. Eighth-grade
    girls <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2016/0518/Girls-outscore-boys-on-a-technology-test-but-troubling-racial-gap-remains">outscore
    boys</a> on technology and engineering literacy tests, but men still get more
    doctorates and dominate leadership positions.</p><p>870 Nobel prizes were awarded
    between 1901 and 2015. Women only won <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html">49
    of those</a>, and they mostly fell outside the science category.</p><p>It was
    2009 and Kathryn Gosselin was preparing to speak at the US National Meeting of
    The Combustion Institute. There was only one problem: She had no idea what to
    wear.</p><p>“I know how my male co-workers and male professors dress for this
    sort of thing, but I have no idea what the female side of that is,” she says.
    “It was seeing [other female scientists] at conferences and saying, oh that’s
    how you dress for a conference and that’s how you carry yourself at a conference.”</p><p>Growing
    up with three younger brothers and a passion for martial arts, Kathryn is used
    to male-dominated spaces. But even she was surprised by how her femaleness complicated
    her academic journey.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*uySap33ZJu9lwFvO-goCQQ.jpeg"
    alt="School of Engineering News — University of Connecticut"><em>School of Engineering
    News — University of Connecticut</em></p><p>After graduating from the University
    of Connecticut with a PhD in mechanical engineering, Kathryn accepted a job as
    Assistant Professor at San Jose State. Part of the position’s allure was the faculty;
    of the 11 full-time employees in her department, three are women. By mechanical
    engineering standards, those numbers are absurdly impressive.</p><p>According
    to <a href="http://ngcproject.org/statistics">a study</a> by the National Science
    Foundation, there are just as many women studying science at an undergraduate
    level as there are men. But the women are not equitably distributed throughout
    the science sub-fields and some branches are better at marketing themselves to
    minorities than others. In mechanical engineering — Kathryn’s area of expertise
    — less than 8% of all employees are female.</p><p>One semester, Kathryn taught
    Thermodynamics to undergrads. She had 40 students in her class — and only one
    was female. It was a challenging dynamic for both the student and for Kathryn.
    “I can only do so much because I’m not a student,” she says. “I’m not her peer,
    I can’t study with her or boost her up on a day-to-day basis.”</p><p>Kathryn knows
    firsthand how hard it is to be the only woman in the room. As one of the only
    female graduate students in her program, she frequently guested on student panels.
    As time went on, she suspected this was for political reasons — a subtle reminder
    to the public that the program “had a girl.” The tokenism grew tiresome. “It’s
    great that you’re making sure to get a woman’s perspective, but it can’t always
    be me.”</p><p>Science’s representation problem is not uniquely female: Blacks
    and Hispanics are also <a href="https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acs-24.pdf">historically
    underrepresented</a> within STEM fields. In 2011, Hispanics made up 7% of all
    STEM workers and Blacks only 6%. And while there are efforts to recruit more diverse
    candidates, as Kathryn puts it, “it’s clearly a huge weakness.”</p><p>Both Sophie
    and Kathryn agree that science is full of heroes—they’re the teachers who boost
    young girls’ confidence and show them a reflection of their future selves. Sophie
    says, “When I see a third grade teacher who is telling her girls what kind of
    scientists they are, that’s my hero. That’s what we need.”</p>'

  :title: How Scientific Publishers Can End Bullying And Harassment In The Sciences
  :content: '<p>How Scientific Publishers Can End Bullying And Harassment In The Sciences</p><h3>Every
    professional organization of scientists has a code of ethics and/or conduct. Why
    not apply it to their journals?</h3><p>When it comes to exploring the Universe,
    many young people get literally starry-eyed at the prospect. The cosmic story
    of what the Universe is, how it works, where it came from, what its fate is, and
    how it got to be this way, is a story we all have in common. Millions of children
    grow up wanting to be scientists; millions still pursue this dream in college
    and beyond. While some choose other fields or avenues for a variety of reasons,
    a great many people — particularly women and people of color — leave the field
    directly due to bullying and harassment. Enduring abuse shouldn’t be a required
    skill for a successful scientific career, and many people and organizations are
    working tirelessly to root out this systemic injustice.</p><p>Many have claimed
    that this is a complex problem with no easy solutions. But there is a simple solution
    right in front of us, for every field. If the publishers of scientific journals
    everywhere enforced a universal code of ethics — if you violate the code, you
    cannot publish your scientific work — systematic bullies and harassers would be
    eliminated from their fields. It’s a proposal that demands consideration.</p><p><img

    remarks from their peers and 44% reporting sexist remarks from their supervisors.
    Among all people of color, 68% experienced racist remarks, with 58% reporting
    racist remarks from their peers and 10% reporting it from their own supervisors.

    have pointed to the most notorious individual offenders such as <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/azeenghorayshi/famous-astronomer-allegedly-sexually-harassed-students">Geoff

    Ott</a> as a few bad apples, but the problem is far more widespread than that.
    Junior researchers who are bullied and harassed often face this from their superiors,
    and are often branded as “troublemakers” if and when they do speak out, further
    harming their academic prospects. In 2016, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/science/c-megan-urry-peering-into-universe-spots-bias-on-the-ground.html">the
    American Astronomical Society (AAS) took the tremendous step</a> of banning scientists
    who violate the society’s <a href="https://aas.org/ethics">code of ethics</a>
    from attending their annual meetings. By extending this ban to the society’s journals
    — which include the prestigious Astrophysical Journal, Astronomical Journal, and
    the Research Notes of the AAS — here’s how the AAS could take the lead in ending
    bullying and harassment in the sciences.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*bWbfv39gmrSwid8C.jpg"
    alt="*U.S. Department of Education Program Legal Group (Title IX), from the United

    are universally taken to enforce this legislation.* (USDA photo by Lance Cheung)">*<em>U.S.

    taken to enforce this legislation.</em> (USDA photo by Lance Cheung)*</p><p>It
    must be clear that the focus needs to be placed on those who bully, harass, and
    behave in a professionally inappropriate and unacceptable fashion. There are a
    great many victims who don’t file formal complaints because they often suffer
    retaliation, while the perpetrator often faces no real consequences for their
    unacceptable behavior. A professional society cannot control the actions of its
    members, but it can control what its rules are for authors who wish to submit
    to their journals. Publications are routinely rejected for improper formatting,
    content, or ad hominem attacks in their submissions. Restricting publications
    on these grounds is commonplace, and is universally regarded to not harm the underlying
    science.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*HftqROv_S8F1zBsv.jpg"
    alt="*Footnotes 8 and 9 from the Bouwens et al. paper, submitted to the Astrophysical
    Journal in November of 2017, clearly contained bullying language directed at a
    junior, woman colleague. Although he has since apologized, his repeated offenses
    have caused irreparable damage.*(Bouwens et al. (2017), via [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02090.pdf)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02090.pdf))">*<em>Footnotes

    why not craft a consistent policy that would actually punish the bullies, harassers,
    and abusers in a way that harms them in the one way they’ve amassed power: in
    their scientific lives? When a senior person harasses a junior person, people
    often fear siding with the junior person because of the backlash they’ll experience
    owing to the senior person’s professional clout. Junior scientists might not have
    enough leverage over the senior harassers to do anything meaningful about it.
    But the journals do. The fact that professional societies like the AAS already
    have a code of conduct/ethics for their members means there’s already a precedent
    for defining and enforcing acceptable versus unacceptable behavior. The next sensible
    step is to apply that same code to the authors who publish in their journals.</p><p><img

    to Seattle in January of 2017, in support of women’s rights and other causes.</em>
    (Elaine Thompson / AP photo)*</p><p>Nominally, when authors submit a scientific
    paper, they click a box avowing that they agree to abide by the rules that the
    publisher has laid out. The addition of a single paragraph would immediately give
    the journals the authority to revoke the publishing privileges of a known bully,
    harasser, or abuser. It could be as simple* as this:</p><blockquote><p><em>By
    submitting this paper for consideration in an AAS Journal, each author agrees
    to abide by the AAS code of conduct/ethics in their treatment of other members
    of AAS and of the astronomical community. The authors understand that failure
    to conduct themselves in an appropriate manner, not only in AAS journals but in
    all aspects of their professional lives, will result in the revocation of their
    privilege to publish in this or any other AAS journal.</em></p></blockquote><p>Bad
    behavior is a widespread problem all over the world in a huge variety of fields.
    It is not exclusive to the sciences, and within the sciences, there is no evidence
    that it’s more prevalent in the field of astronomy than it is in other fields
    such as mathematics, computer science, or physics, for example. But acknowledging
    that it is also bad in other places does not absolve anyone of the responsibility
    to root out the bad actors who pervade their own disciplines.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*u03-NQyxjzdFpmlC."

    most common counterargument to instituting a policy like this is the fear that
    people who aren’t bullies or harassers will be lumped in with them, and punished
    for a misinterpreted action. To be clear: no one is advocating banning authors
    for one mild violation. People need room to make mistakes, to learn, and to grow.
    But egregiously bad behavior, repeated unwanted advances and behavior, and continued
    harassment of the same individual — even if that individual once showed professional
    or even personal interest in you — is indeed grounds for this type of punishment.
    To those fearful of a witch hunt: it’s only a witch hunt if you convict or condemn
    innocent people. Punishing the guilty offenders who have gotten away with bullying
    and harassment for years or decades is quite the opposite of a witch hunt. It’s
    justice and protection for past, present, and potentially future victims.</p><p><img

    a century ago, women experienced vastly different treatment than men in academic
    circles and institutions. Here in 2018, the playing field is still far from level,

    rely on individual departments or colleges/universities to protect the victims
    of academic bullying or harassment. Decades of inaction and inadequate action
    have shown that senior faculty members will continue to engage in unacceptable
    behavior unless there are real consequences that threaten to take their power
    away. Their academic careers, however, are based in their ability to successfully
    publish their work and results in prestigious and meritorious journals, and therefore
    it is truly the publishers who hold the power to police their actions. If we are
    serious about solving our bullying and harassment problems, and making scientific
    research opportunities truly the open and merit-based game we idealize them to
    be, we can take this next great step. We can not only condemn, but forbid, the
    unacceptable behavior that continues to cost our fields so many of our best and
    brightest minds.</p><p>(** — Note: this recommendation and assessment is not meant

    concluded that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/internet-of-things/">IBM</a>,<a href="http://www.ptc.com/internet-of-things">
    PTC</a>, <a href="https://www.ge.com/digital/predix">GE</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/internet-of-things-azure-iot-suite">Microsoft</a>
    currently lead the IoT platform market. It is surprisingly to see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot/">AWS</a>
    considered a competitor on the outside looking in. Amongst minor players, <a href="https://exosite.com/">Exosite</a>,
    <a href="https://www.aylanetworks.com/">Ayla Networks</a>, and <a href="https://www.zebra.com/us/en/products/software/internet-of-things.html">Zebra

    60% of global enterprises leading towards using IoT solutions, the need for effective
    IoT platforms will continue to grow to build connected products, leverage big
    data analytics, and improve operational efficiency.</p></li><li><p>Successful
    IoT platform companies currently provide easy to use prebuilt applications, analytic
    functions driven by machine learning and big data, and a multitude of solutions
    from data ingestion to visualization. Forrester expects those that allow extended

    *</em>*The IoT platform landscape is constantly changing. After Forrester evaluated
    the 11 platforms, there have been major changes: Microsoft released virtual device
    functionality in IoT hub and updated its cognitive toolkit. AWS also made major
    improvements to its user interface earlier this month. As more businesses are
    discovering the value in IoT is in the services not just in the devices, the ecosystem
    that successful platforms provide will become a crucial piece of your IoT solution.</p><h2>VR
    Powered by our Minds</h2><p>Virtual reality is still a thing of the future for
    many. Many of its applications are limited to gaming, and VR headsets are either
    prohibitively expensive or not powerful enough to make VR truly useful. Dan Cook,
    CEO of <a href="http://www.eyemyndbvr.com/">EyeMynd</a>, believes that the future
    may be closer than we think. He envisions an operating system that translates
    brainwaves into the VR world without invasive electrodes, handsets, or controllers.
    Cook’s vision echoes what Facebook CEO <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/14/zuckerberg-telepathy-facebook-live-video-seinfeld">Mark
    Zuckerberg publicly announced</a> earlier this year about the possibility of brain-to-brain
    communication — or in more layman’s terms, telepathy.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2148/1*nVI2o3CJP1izpHCPjwuw_Q.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p><strong><em>Summary:</em></strong></p><ul><li><p>EyeMynd plans to
    launch a headpiece that monitors brainwaves in spring 2017. The brainwaves picked
    up by 16 electroencephalography (EEG) sensors will be translated by EyeMynd’s
    Brainwave OS and will be compatible with the HTC Vive.</p></li><li><p>The first
    version will ship with a game called “Smile with Lucy,” to calibrate brainwaves
    signal. Currently the calibration process takes an hour, but Cook hopes to cut
    that down to three minutes with improved processing power.</p></li><li><p>While
    EyeMynd joins <a href="https://www.emotiv.com/">Emotiv</a> and <a href="http://neurosky.com/">NeuroSky</a>
    to commercialize EEG headsets, many neuroscientists are skeptical: accurate readings
    of brainwaves require invasive surgery as most signals cannot make it past the
    skull.</p></li></ul><p><em>**Takeaway: *</em>*Cook is envisioning a future where
    VR accessories will become obsolete as brain sensors take over the role of motion
    sensors, headsets, and cameras. Brain-directed VR certainly has a lot of potential
    in scientific communities providing virtual therapy (<a href="https://medium.com/p/e9baa77f5e16">see

    or a step towards reality next spring.</p><h2>Quote of the Week</h2><blockquote><p>“It’s
    unlikely that big data will bring about a fundamental change to the study of people
    and society…In other words, the systematic recording of masses of data alone won’t
    be enough to ensure the reproducibility and objectivity of social studies, because
    these studies need to use often controversial social concepts to make their data
    significant. They use them to organize “raw” data into objects, categories and
    events, and in doing so they infect even the most “reliable event data” with their
    partiality and subjectivity.”- <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/18/big-data-cant-bring-objectivity-to-a-subjective-world/">Simon
    Chandler</a>, TechCrunch Staff</p></blockquote><p>The success of big data cannot
    be overstated in hard sciences. However, Simon Chandler argues that big data’s
    role in the social, political, and economic realms are much more limited. While
    some social science scholars argue that data analytics may lead to improved objectivity
    and clarity, big data alone cannot alter the inherent subjective nature of the
    concepts in social sciences. Chandler takes the idea of “war” or “adult” for example
    to illustrate how these social constructs take on new meaning based on the communities
    who propagate them.</p><p>More concretely, Chandler cites a recent study published
    in the <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6307/1502">Sept 30 issue
    of *Science</a>*. The study attempted to monitor global societal events using
    big data provided by Lockheed Martin’s International Crisis Early Warning System
    (ICEWS), Georgetown University’s Global Data on Events Language and Tone (GDELT),
    the University of Illinois’ Social, Political, and Economic Event Database (SPEED)
    and the Gold Standard Report (GSR) maintained by the not-for-profit MITRE Corporation.</p><p>To
    test the reliability of these systems, the authors tested if these datasets could
    register similar protests in Latin America. They found that only 10.3% of the
    protests showed significant similarities with the combination of the four databases
    despite their sheer volume. Also, the study found that 79% of GDELT’s recorded
    protests never occurred, and ICEWS had duplicate events.</p><p>While significant
    improvements in cleaning up the data could theoretically improve the results,
    Chandler points to a flawed underlying assumption in relying heavily on big data
    in social science. The data is inherently subjective, and no amount of hyper-tuning
    parameters on these analytic algorithms could yield impartial results.</p><p>Looking
    at how data failed us in the elections and adding to it Chandler’s view, we can
    start to see that perhaps big data isn’t the cure-all for everything.</p><h3>The

  :title: The Connection Between Mathematics and Empirical Sciences
  :content: '<p>By Sergio Albiac</p><p>The mathematics of thought is something that
    interests me very much in my research. How does mathematics shape our conceptualization
    of reality? That is the basic question that I always ask myself. You might have
    a trivial answer to this question because mathematical methods are everywhere,
    especially in the empirical sciences such as physics.</p><p><strong><em>Physical
    theories cannot be formulated without using mathematics.</em></strong> In biology,
    we use mathematical models to study the behavior of specific patterns of organisms,
    and in sociology, we use mathematics to analyze social networks. In that sense,
    mathematical methods are everywhere in empirical science because empirical science
    has shaped the way we see reality. Naturally, mathematics has a part in that as
    an indispensable scientific tool.</p><p>However, I am more interested in mathematics
    as a philosophical paradigm. To give you an idea of what that means, I’m going
    to introduce five examples from the history of philosophy.</p><p>The first one,
    of course, is Plato, who thought that mathematical knowledge was the highest form
    of intelligence. We know this because he had engraved the sentence, “Let no one
    ignorant of geometry enter here!” on top of the entrance to his Academy. He always
    believed that proficiency in mathematics was a prerequisite for the acquisition
    of any further knowledge.</p><p>Galileo had a slightly different view than Plato.
    He believed that mathematics was the language of the book of nature. He thought
    that it was the scientists’ task to become proficient in that language and thereby
    study the fundamental structures of reality.</p><p>Although Kant had an extraordinary
    place in his philosophy for mathematics, he thought that mathematics is a prime
    example of a particular class of human judgments. <em>**He called judgments as
    synthetic a priori. *</em>*We formed those judgments without consulting our experience,
    but still, they were analytical judgments, and we got to learn something new in
    those judgments. According to Kant, we could learn how these judgments work in
    different contexts.</p><p>Nietzsche believed that mathematics was a paradigm of
    refinement and rigor. He thought that all other sciences should strive to be as
    much as possible, like mathematics, in that respect.</p><p>Lastly, one of the
    most influential mathematicians of all time, Cantor, who proved that there are
    infinities of different sizes. He found very straightforward and simple proof
    that <strong>the set of real numbers is larger than the set of natural numbers
    even though both are infinitely large.</strong> He also called these infinities
    transfinite numbers. Then <strong>he came with an idea of absolute infinite that
    was a manifestation of God.</strong> In other words, Cantor found something divine
    in mathematics.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*CptpSoXvYjpvde7fCffwDA.jpeg"
    alt="[The Golden Ratio: The Divine Beauty of Mathematics](https://amzn.to/30d9IX7)"><em><a
    href="https://amzn.to/30d9IX7">The Golden Ratio: The Divine Beauty of Mathematics</a></em></p><p>To
    give you a slightly better picture of the relationship between mathematics and
    the empirical sciences and how this relationship has evolved, we should go back
    to ancient Greek. For the ancient Greeks, mathematicians such as Plato, Pythagoras,
    and Euclid were the only source of true knowledge of certain knowledge. In contrast,
    our beliefs about the empirical world were considered to be mere opinions. It
    is because the empirical world is continuously changing. He believed that it’s
    impossible to have specific knowledge about something ever-changing.</p><p>We
    see here that mathematics is the sort of knowledge above all, and the empirical
    world is something we can have opinions about but not know anything about — a
    very distinct separation between the two realms.</p><p>When empirical scientists
    started to blossom, and the exploration of the empirical world started to become
    more and more systematic, this picture changed dramatically during the times of
    the Scientific Revolution many centuries later. Today, we’ve arrived at a picture
    where mathematics was considered the language of nature. Scientists were considered
    to learn that language and also figure out the fundamental laws of the universe.
    These laws were thought to be mathematical laws. So by putting mathematical laws
    with our observations, the scientists were supposed to understand the fundamental
    truths of reality. This picture changed again in the 19th century, the time that
    we now call empiricism. During that time, the fortunes of mathematics were completely
    reversed again. For example, some empiricists believed that mathematics didn’t
    have any content of its own. Yes, it is a handy tool for the empirical sciences
    but a mere tool nevertheless. The only source of certain well-grounded knowledge
    was considered to be the empirical sciences.</p><p>So mathematics started as being
    this highest form of knowledge. Then it is merged with the empirical sciences.
    Later the empirical sciences became our paradigm of well-grounded education, and
    mathematics was considered to be a mere tool for the sciences. Another way of
    saying this is mathematics started as something that could be called the language
    of God. The ancient Greeks believed that the reason that we find sort of imperfect
    geometrical figures in the empirical world is because the gods gave geometry to
    the world to make us understand that this nature is an intelligible environment.</p><p>After
    the scientific revolution, mathematics became the language of nature. During empiricist
    times, it had become or taken a fall down to the level of a mere language of men.
    What we see here is the continuous dissociation of mathematics from the physical
    world. The crossover point that I mentioned earlier coincides roughly with the
    rise of pure mathematics.</p><p>So in the 19th century, mathematical concepts
    had little or no physical meaning started to be introduced by mathematicians as
    legitimate objects of mathematical study such as dimensional spaces, transfinite
    numbers, non-euclidean geometries, complex numbers. All these mathematical objects
    did not have any definite physical meaning anymore. So <strong><em>mathematics,
    in that sense, moved beyond concepts that were suggested directly by our experience
    of physical reality.</em></strong></p><p>At the beginning of the 20th century,
    Morris Klein was one of the most essential and well-known historians of mathematics.
    Once he writes very nicely, <strong><em>the circle within which mathematical studies
    appeared to be enclosed at the beginning of the 19th century was broken at all
    points. Mathematics exploded into a hundred branches that each built on its system
    of axioms.”</em></strong></p><p>So that’s a very vivid picture of what happened
    to mathematics. Exploded into all these different subfields and people working
    in these various subfields wouldn’t necessarily talk much to people working in
    other mathematical subfields.</p><p>In the first half of the 20th century, set
    theory, one branch of mathematics, suddenly acquired a lot of importance. It was
    because a group of French mathematicians was working under the sort of pen name
    Bourbaki group started to prove that set theory is a foundation for all of mathematics.
    *<em>They showed that we could express all mathematical theorems in the language
    of set theory, which of course, made visible the interconnections between all
    these branches of mathematics. *</em>It made evident the fundamental assumptions
    that were being made in all the various branches of mathematics. Most importantly,
    it provided a unified framework and a unified language in which all the different
    branches of mathematics could be interpreted.</p><p>The set theory created a foundation
    for all mathematics, but it did more than that. It created an autonomous mathematical
    paradise. That is David Hilbert’s expression; “As such as this freestanding paradise,
    this freestanding mathematical realm became a perfect model for other domains,
    at least from the philosopher’s point of view.”</p><p>So just to summarize this
    again to make the movement visible.</p><ul><li><p>In the beginning, ancient Greece,
    ultimate reality is where mathematics is in the Platonic heaven of eternal forms.</p></li><li><p>During
    the times of the Scientific Revolution, the ultimate truths of reality are actually
    hidden in nature.</p></li><li><p>During the time of the empiricists, mathematics
    has become nothing but a mere tool.</p></li></ul><p>The only reality we have is
    this physical reality, but actually, a mathematical reality and an empirical reality
    coexist. They exist independently of one another, but they intersect in the area
    of Applied Mathematics. I want to point out to you that the perception of reality
    changes parallel to the movements in the history of mathematics.</p><p>A mathematical
    ideal does not only shape our perception of physical reality, but it also shapes
    how we understand and conceptualize other very fundamental areas of our lives.
    Mathematics is ideal because mathematical truths are indisputably certain. Mathematical
    knowledge gives us 100% certainty. Mathematical statements have objective and
    determinate truth values.</p><p>In that sense, mathematics has become a benchmark
    for all other areas of discourse that have a claim to objectivity. That makes
    mathematics very interesting to philosophers as a model for other non-empirical
    domains. What philosophers tried to achieve is similar to mathematics because
    that generates credibility. They think that they can draw interesting inferences
    from comparing mathematics to other areas such as ethics, logic, metaphysics,
    and religion. You might think that what do these domains have in common with one
    another.</p><p>Look at the statements of these domains.</p><blockquote><p>Look
    at the statements of these domains.In maths, we have statements like two plus
    two equals four,In ethics a statement like torturing babies for fun is wrong,In
    logic, a statement like if p then q,In metaphysics, there could be purple pigs,And
    in religion, we say if you’re religious, God created the universe.</p></blockquote><p>In
    terms of their actual content, these statements do not have anything in common,
    of course. They talk about very different things, but from a philosophical point
    of view, they are related. The reason is that, first of all, they refer to non-empirical
    entities that are beyond the grasp of empirical investigation such as numbers,
    values, norms, reasons, moral properties, propositions, possible worlds. All these
    things are things we cannot investigate with our traditional means of empirical
    science.</p><p>Many of us would intuitively think that these statements are true.
    So that’s a different way of saying that many of us are realists about these domains.
    What does that mean to be a realist? First, it means that we’re in some sense
    committed to their being non-empirical entities like numbers, moral entities,
    values, etc. It also means that we believe in statements in those domains having
    objective truth values. We also believe that the truth of those domains is not
    reducible to truths about something else.</p><p>We believe that these truths are
    knowable. Thus we can get to know mathematical, ethical, metaphysical truths,
    etc. If you’re a realist about these domains and if you’re committed to at least
    some of these claims, you’re also going to face several challenges.</p><p>I want
    to give you some quotes, so you can see that this is an actual debate going on
    by actual people.</p><p>Moral anti-realists would say stuff like this; “Radical
    differences between first-order moral judgments make it difficult to treat those
    judgments as apprehensions of objective truths.” Brian Leiter then supports the
    point and argues that “Persistent disagreement on foundational questions… distinguishes
    moral theory from inquiry in the sciences and mathematics.”</p><p>So what they’re
    pointing out is that mathematicians do disagree radically and passionately about
    several things most notably about questions of mathematical foundations.</p>'

    profile. I happen to run into him and strike up a conversation, which led to another
    conversation over lunch.</p><p>We sat down at an organic food market for lunch
    and he began to tell me his story.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*3VwE1x-lnGZB14v1EaKeVQ.png"
    alt="ISO 9000 is an international standard for quality management systems"><em>ISO
    9000 is an international standard for quality management systems</em></p><p><strong>He
    was a writer and senior lead auditor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9000">ISO
    9000</a>.</strong></p><p>The ISO 9000 is a globally-adopted, quality business
    management standard used by huge brands with support businesses located internationally.
    The reason why it exists is so stakeholders can believe with confidence that a
    manufacturing plant located in another country will produce exactly what the contract
    says, without having to travel to that plant to conduct a huge inspection. If
    the plant is ISO 9000- or ISO 9001-certified, then they know it will perform to
    standard.</p><p>The ISO 9000 is based on <a href="https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/archive/pdf/en/pub100080.pdf">7
    quality management principles</a>. Adherers include companies in the automotive,
    chemical, and aerospace manufacturing industries such as GM, Chrysler, Boeing,
    General Electric, Northrop Grumman, Alibaba, and Eastman Chemical Company.</p><p>This
    man told me that he applied the quality management principles he helped establish
    in the ISO 9000 to the ten separate businesses he operates today. His businesses
    include a skateboard and BMX shop, a network of pawnshops, a consulting practice,
    a musical instruments shop, an Internet sales business, a real estate development
    and management firm, a firearms shop, a marine products online store, a standup
    paddleboards shop, and a visual displays store.</p><p>You would think these ten
    companies would dominate his time. Not so. He spends his time sailing around the
    world with his wife and family in one of his sailboats, the “Zephyr” or the “Whispering
    Eye.”</p><p>Here’s what he told me about life and business. Visualize everything
    below in quotes.</p><h2>Multiple Revenue Streams</h2><p>If you were to look at
    just one of the ten businesses I have, it would not be that impressive. It would
    provide for a simple, decent living for a small family, not much more than that.
    It’s an unglamorous yet stable, small and focused, profitable operation.</p><p>By
    itself, it’s basic and ordinary. You young, startup-crazy whippersnappers want
    something so high-profile and instantly viral. My businesses aren’t viral, but
    they help a specific type of person by providing a quality solution, over and
    over again.</p><p>Multiply a small, quaint, and profitable business by ten and
    you’ve got a diversified, multi-million dollar portfolio.</p><h2>Do Not Partner</h2><p>If
    you can help it, do not partner with anyone. The more partners you have, the more
    you have to split the pie. The more partners you have, the more you have to fight
    for your point of view. The more partners you have, the more time it will take
    to execute anything. Co-founding is overrated.</p><p>Learn the skills yourself,
    bootstrap, and then hire the right people (see below).</p><h2>Study the Market</h2><p>We
    are in a small market. We are not in San Francisco, Paris, or New York. I’ve seen
    that smaller markets are two to three years behind the larger markets; whatever
    is selling in the big cities, will not be selling in ours at the same time. But
    give it two to three years and it will be selling like hotcakes.</p><p>Find out
    what this is, and be the first to open a shop in your small market.</p><h2>Be
    Very, Very Careful With Who You Hire</h2><p>My employees are transferable between
    business lines. Each employee is multi-skilled. The girl behind the counter is
    doing social media marketing online in between customers checking out.</p><p>Each
    business has a manager with a bank card. Each manager is trained in the same principles
    of the ISO 9000 and is given full control of their business. Through a tight incentive
    plan, I make sure that if the business does well, they do well. If they want to
    order the hottest, new products to sell in their shop, they have to sell enough
    to fill up the bank account, to purchase the inventory.</p><p>I look for people
    who are independent and responsible, who take complete ownership of their business.
    This allows me to travel the way I do, because I know my employees are working
    hard for themselves.</p><p>Oh, and we have parties OFTEN. We casually share ideas
    about what marketing tactics are working in one business that may work in another,
    we have performance awards, and we do fun things together.</p><h2>How to Do Well
    in Business</h2><p>Here is the mission statement for all of my companies, it’s
    very simple:</p><blockquote><h1><strong>To provide our customers with value-added
    services and quality products.</strong></h1></blockquote><p>To be successful in
    business does not mean changing the world. It means meeting a need (regardless
    of size) well and dependably over time.</p><p>Sell something. If it’s a product,
    make sure its quality, then sell it at a fair price, and make sure the breakeven
    point is doable for you as the business owner. If it’s a service, make sure there
    is added value, as in you are very good and knowledgeable in your field, and the

    sense rules over everything. That’s what I learned from selling crack.” — Snoop

    entrepreneur. I’ve been in business for eight years, after engaging in my own
    personal and tenuous renaissance (uh…divorce) and rediscovering my Divine Core
    Purpose. In other words, I grew a pair of ladyballs, launched a business, and
    tried to make enough money to keep a roof over my head.</p><p>But there was a
    <em>lot</em> to learn, some of which wasn’t covered in <em>Who Moved My Cheese?</em></p><p>Throw
    these four rockstars into a blender, and you’ll have a composite sketch of me
    in the first three months of my business:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*O7mFfdM0OPCUsb9o.png"
    alt="photo: author’s collection"><em>photo: author’s collection</em></p><p>Glitter
    was literally shooting out of my eye sockets as I quit my PR firm job and dove
    headfirst into entrepreneurship. Full of optimism, living in New York City and
    surrounded by a tribe of friends who were also launching businesses, art, and
    gigs, I felt it was the perfect time to make a bold move and be my own boss. I
    was now Officially Living My Dream and Working For Myself, which meant I was in
    charge of My Financial Destiny and Captain of My Promising Future.</p><p>Luckily,
    my initial hyper-optimism buoyed me whilst, oscillating between euphoria and despair,
    I was systematically forced off The Magic School Bus and onto the S.S. Battleship
    Long Haul.</p><p>I was a quick and eager learner, but despite the hours of webinar
    watching, countless Friday nights pumping out site copy, and teaching myself everything
    I could about HTML, there were just some things I didn’t get. I had to fall on
    my ass to procure the “master’s degree in life survival” every entrepreneur earns
    on their “journey.” (Yes, those are bitterly gesticulated air quotes.)</p><p>Here
    are 11 things I wish I knew when I started my business. I hope they will save
    you some time and some anguish because (experience is a good teacher here) the
    sodium from your tears acts as a corrosive melting agent on all brands of premium
    ice cream (although it does make a superb saline for your dirty martini). Cry
    over a cup, oh fathomless bird of preneurial gumption!</p><h3><strong>1. Running
    the business is your first priority.</strong></h3><p>Your success (and financial
    stability) will come from expertly running your business — not writing copy, rebranding
    your client’s website, running your candle boutique, teaching yoga, selling real
    estate, or making jewelry. In other words, you will spend 15 percent of your time
    doing what you love (in my case coaching and writing) and 85 percent marketing,
    administrating, selling, strategizing, and answering a shitload of email. Survival
    will hinge on how quickly you adopt this role of business owner first, creator
    of pretty things second.</p><p>This sucked for me because I wanted nothing to
    do with running a business. I just wanted to be a writer and a coach who wrote
    and coached all day. I didn’t get it.</p><h3><strong>2. Ready to meet your soulmate?
    It’s you.</strong></h3><p>Entrepreneurship is the most life-changing relationship
    (like marriage or parenthood) that a person can have. You will be confronted overandoverandover
    with your fears, insecurities, crappy excuses, limitations, justifications, shitty
    integrity, and inefficient time management. The standard you held yourself to
    in the workaday world was good enough then, but it won’t be good enough to run
    your own business.</p><p>You will learn to accept yourself through all this because,
    in order to get up every day and be the CEO, you will have to. Somehow, while
    you’re busy putting yourself out there in spite of your flaws, you will come to
    deeply admire yourself. Not in the over-hyped “Self Love 2018” way, but in a quiet
    way that sneaks up on you after witnessing a thousand splinter-sized moments of
    transcending the baser aspects of yourself.</p><h3><strong>3. Your trajectory
    for success will take as long as everyone else’s, even though you are SpeCiaL
    and BRilliANt.</strong></h3><p>I heard the “two-year rule” when I started my biz,
    but I was confident I could do it in six months. I believed with every fiber of
    my glittery, go-gettin’ heart that my work ethic (15-hour days, seven days a week)
    — along with my talent, skills, and personal magic — I could rip a path to accelerated
    success. My Myers-Briggs and Enneagram profiles were finally aligned and I expected
    nothing less than to be #blessed.</p><p>Jesus had other plans.</p><p>See number
    4.</p><h3><strong>4. Running out of money is a common part of the journey.</strong></h3><p>You
    won’t expect it, because you prepared for the long haul<em>. *You secured a business
    loan, or got some investors, or sold your house, or have one year’s worth of savings
    and have *planned accordingly.</em></p><p>But then all of a sudden, midst the
    puffy clouds and blue skies, your little Entreprenairplane will sputter, gas gauge
    unexpectedly plummeting to zero, and you will only have one choice: land on the
    wild abandoned air strip called Bank Balance: 14 Dollars. This will be the last
    place you ever thought you’d crash land, because didn’t you pass this test on
    No More Amazon Prime Island?</p><p>Well.</p><p>The good news is this is a rite
    of passage that will launch you into the League of Business Badassery in which,
    once you are out of the money hellhole, you will be unstoppable. You’ve been to
    the baddest prison there is, looked down the barrel of your worst fear, and stood
    your ground. You didn’t quit. You got up the next day, and you wrote your next
    post, you storyboarded your next product offering, and answered customer emails
    with zero dollars in your bank account.</p><p>There is nothing more beautiful
    than running out of money and realizing that you are doing your work because you’ve
    got the balls to push through your worst fears when there is no evidence of security.
    You really, truly love what you do, and you’d do it for free if you had to.</p><p>Irony
    is a sassy bitch, isn’t she?</p><h3><strong>5. Build a hybrid stream of income.</strong></h3><p>Learn
    from my mistake: Take a second job if it will give you peace of mind. I was so
    resistant to “dividing my focus” or taking any action which I interpreted as undermining
    my commitment to being totally successful in my business. I really thought by
    making a Plan B I was telling the “Universe” I wasn’t 100 percent serious but
    hello! I created a worse problem by allowing financial stress to gut me of my
    sanity.</p><p>If having a steady stream of income would buy you peace of mind,
    DO IT.</p><p>I finally came to terms with the fact that I was being naïve about
    how money, peace, survival, and timing all work together, and I got a second job.
    Since I wasn’t freaking out about money anymore, I liberated more creative real
    estate in my brain to apply toward my business.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*EcnqeZ6eqW5zYQYWjdDfag.jpeg"
    alt="Graphic: Stephanie St.Claire"><em>Graphic: Stephanie St.Claire</em></p><h3><strong>6.
    Create a healthy distance between yourself and your work.</strong></h3><p>Does
    Lizzo walk around the house checking how many likes she got on Instagram? No honey,
    she’s too busy planning D-Day.</p><blockquote><h1>Lizzo does not identify with
    “Lizzo.”</h1><h1>Lizzo employs “Lizzo.”</h1></blockquote><h3><strong>7. Spend
    less time researching, more time doing.</strong></h3><p>Researching, studying,
    and consuming Tai Lopez’s “5 Tips to Email Marketing” is a form of resistance.
    In order to get clarity, you must act.</p><p>Clarity does not come by learning
    more — <strong>it comes by jumping in with your instincts and putting yourself
    out there, even if you don’t know exactly what you’re doing.</strong></p><p>Block
    out the distractions (turn off the phone, social media, and email notifications)
    and take inspired action that feels tangible and measurable. Set a timer for 25
    minutes and go to town on a task. <strong>Do not look up. Do not go to the bathroom.
    Do not cruise the fridge for cheese sticks.</strong> Get something done, despite
    the fact that at times you will feel like you are pissing into the wind. Piss
    into the wind four times a day, and you’ll make a difference in your bottom line.</p><h3><strong>8.
    Only say yes to business partners and projects that are <em>hell</em> <em>yes</em>es.</strong></h3><p>Scrutinize
    any joint project carefully and qualify the person you’re collaborating with (even
    if they are your friend and have been in business longer than you). Get everything
    in writing before you embark on the project, with a clear division of labor and
    deadline dates. If you have a business partner, draft and sign an operating agreement.
    <em>Do not skip this.</em></p><p>You will most likely be splitting the profits,
    so have two numbers in your head: The number you <em>need</em> to make in order
    to pay for your time, and the number you would <em>like</em> to make. Set the
    first financial deadline early so that you both have the freedom to walk away
    if the project isn’t going to be profitable. Have a transition strategy in mind
    so in case that happens and one of you wants to continue on with the project,
    there is a way to pass the baton gracefully.</p><p>Summed up: communicate about
    everything — even though you’re friends, even though you love each other, even
    though you trust each other, even though you’ve worked together at XYZ Company
    because projects have a way of going sideways and making everyone a little custodial
    and overreactive.</p><h3><strong>9. You must devote time to becoming a brilliant
    marketer.</strong></h3><p>I know you just want to spend all your days making CBD
    candles, or sarsaparilla-scented beard oil, or writing your YA fantasy novel,
    or life coaching entrepreneurs to stratospheric success, but <strong>if you don’t
    spend time marketing you will not make money.</strong></p><p>This was my biggest
    weakness when I started. I thought marketing meant slimy sales letters with big
    arrows and opt-in boxes, and I couldn’t! I wouldn’t! So I put my head in magical
    fairyland sand, stubbornly insisting that my customers would be tractor-beamed
    into my budding practice by the pulsating, heavenly light that radiated from my
    vision boards and four blog posts.</p><p>And then I ate canned food and spaghetti
    for a long, long time.</p><p>What rescued me? Knowing what marketing personality
    I embody. There are three main types:</p><ol><li><p>The Wisdom Advisor (Brene
    Brown, Danielle LaPorte, Marianne Williamson, Seth Godin), whose marketing feels
    like, “This is what I’ve found to work best. Let’s brainstorm together, and I’ll
    help you find out what’ll work for you.”</p></li><li><p>The Guru (Mel Robbins,
    Dave Ramsey, Gary Vaynerchuk, Marie Forleo, Tony Robbins), whose marketing boldly
    states, “Listen to me. I have the answers.” And finally,</p></li><li><p>The Connector
    (Joe Rogan, Oprah, Tim Ferris, James Altucher), who connect people with experts
    and resources.</p></li></ol><p>Once you have figured out your marketing personality,
    selling to your customers will be a thousand times easier because you will be
    working within your natural ability. Learn how you like to market and stick to
    that. Do it consistently and often. Even if you hire a pro, you will be doing
    some marketing yourself. Keeping your website fresh and current is essential,
    so also learn the backend of Squarespace or WordPress. You will be in the guts
    of your website <em>a lot</em>.</p><h3><strong>10. Do not screw your own time
    economy.</strong></h3><p>Email will become your new best frenemy. Your inbox will
    explode. You care about everyone, but you can’t help everyone. Read: Not everyone
    is your customer. Your job is to quickly discern who’s who and respond in the
    most appropriate way.</p><p>*<em>For Your Customers: *</em>Acknowledge the situation,
    request, or problem and extend an invite to a 20-minute call. Include your available
    dates, times, and phone number.</p><p>*<em>For Non-Customers: *</em>Acknowledge
    the situation, request, or problem and provide other resources, experts, or articles
    that would be a splendid fit.</p><p><strong>11. This last tip is a hodgepodge.</strong></p><p>Do
    not work your business seven days a week. Cover your legal ass from day one. From
    time to time, forget everything you know about the “right way” to run a business
    and run it like a neighborhood lemonade stand. Do not price your offerings around
    your personal ability to pay for it — you are not your ideal customer. Working
    out perplexing issues in your business will resolve problems in other areas of
    your life. Take a walk around the block every day at lunch. And lastly, if you
    want to be smarter in business, don’t ever forget that you are serving real, live
    human beings (not demographics, stats, or your pipeline).</p><p>Good luck everyone!</p><p><em>//</em></p><p><em>Note

  :title: Your Media Business Will Not Be Saved
  :content: '<p>A still from John Carpenter’s “Prince of Darkness” (it’s actually
    about Satan but whatever)</p><p>Video will not save your media business. Nor will
    bots, newsletters, a “morning briefing” app, a “lean back” iPad experience, Slack
    integration, a Snapchat channel, or a great partnership with Twitter. All of these
    things together might help, but even then, you will not be saved by the magical
    New Thing that everyone else in the media community is convinced will be the answer
    to The Problem.</p><p>I can tell you from personal experience over the last several
    months, having met with countless investors and leaders of media companies and
    editors and writers and technologists in the media world that there is a desperate
    belief that The Problem can be solved with the New Thing. <em>And goddammit someone
    must have it in their pitch deck.</em> A new kind of video app. The best news
    stories of the day, except all on video. Video, but with subtitles. Only 30 second
    videos, designed for vertical screens. A personalized Facebook bot that delivers
    only the video you want. Video on-demand, over-the-top, linear, succulent, meaningful,
    plentiful, attention-grabbing video!</p><p>Or maybe a newsletter of some type.
    A video newsletter.</p><p>But let me back up.</p><p>What’s The Problem, you ask?
    The Problem is that we used to have a really neat and tidy version of a media
    business where very large interests controlled vast swaths of the things we read,
    watched, and listened to. Because that system was built on the concept of scarcity
    and locality — the limits of what was physically possible — it was very easy to
    keep the gates and fill the coffers. Put simply, there were far fewer players
    in the game with far fewer outlets for their content, so audiences were easy to
    sell to and easy to come by.</p><p>Then digital. Then you and me. And all of a
    sudden all those old, fixed channels started falling apart. Papers didn’t sell.
    Magazines died. Networks scrambled. Local news meant a lot less. Local papers
    even less than that. Suddenly a lot more free stuff was available online, and
    anyone could start a blog! But the media industry is a hulking, stupid, slow moving
    beast that has little awareness about its threats and surrounding environs. I’m
    skipping over a few parts, but by and large the industry responded to the <em>promise</em>
    (or <em>threat</em>, as they treated it) of digital by ignoring it or denying
    it. So instead of the content creators and advertisers who paid them shifting
    their attention and understanding of user value towards the future (digital everything),
    they kept plugging away at the old system. Basically: it was really hard for them
    to figure out the internet, and all of the money (like subscriber dollars) were
    still going to traditional outlets. So magazine ads remained orders of magnitude
    more valuable than their digital counterparts (if said counterpart even existed).
    TV was not even in the same class. Pennies on the dollar doesn’t begin to describe
    it. It is still mostly this way today. A broken model that is aging badly.</p><p>A
    second thing happened alongside those foundational publishing challenges: this
    industry which had controlled its ability to reach a populace through ownership
    of things like printing presses began to cede its power in the delivery and distribution
    process to other people. People who didn’t care about or understand the media
    business. People who told them the answer wasn’t the <em>best of something</em>,
    it was the <em>most of something</em>.</p><p>Partially this was done out of fear,
    but mostly it was done out of ignorance.</p><p>So over time, we built up scale
    in digital to replace user value. We thought we could solve with numbers (the
    new, seemingly infinite numbers the internet and social media provides) what we
    couldn’t solve with attention. And with every new set of eyeballs (or clicks,
    or views) we added, we diminished the merit of what we made. And advertisers asked
    for more, because those eyes were worth less. And we made more. And it was less
    valuable.</p><p>The media industry now largely thinks its only working business
    model is to reach as many people as possible, and sell — usually programmatically,
    but sometimes not — as many advertisements against that audience as it can. If
    they tell you otherwise, they are lying.</p><p>They are also wrong, I believe,
    in the long run.</p><p>And every few months — or let’s say annually — a technology,
    or idea, or person comes along and the very stupid and slow media industry thinks
    that New Thing will fix everything. Get them back to the good times. Make those
    pennies into actual dollars. One year it might be the iPad, the next it might
    be an “amateur journalist” network, maybe last year it’s <em>You Won’t Believe
    What Happens Next</em>, maybe next year it’s video (or live video?), maybe it’s
    bots. Maybe it’s Instant Articles. Maybe it’s your new app.</p><p>Certainly it
    could be a little bit of all of those things. But actually it’s not any of them.
    You can always get some runway out of the New Thing. You can always get a quick
    hit that looks like success from the New Thing. But rarely — almost never — is
    the New Thing what fixes your problem.</p><p>Your problem is that you make shit.
    A lot of shit. Cheap shit. And no one cares about you or your cheap shit. And
    an increasingly aware, connected, and mutable audience is onto your cheap shit.
    They don’t want your cheap shit. They want the good shit. And they will go to
    find it somewhere. Hell, they’ll even pay for it.</p><p>The truth is that the
    best and most important things the media (let’s say specifically the news media)
    has ever made were not made to reach the <em>most</em> people — they were made
    to reach the <em>right people</em>. Because human beings exist, and we are not
    content consumption machines. What will save the media industry — or at least
    the part worth saving — is when we start making Real Things for people again,
    instead of programming for algorithms or New Things.</p><p>So what will matter
    in the next age of media?</p><p>Compelling voices and stories, real and raw talent,
    new ideas that actually serve or delight an audience, brands that have meaning
    and ballast; these are things that matter in the next age of media. Thinking of
    your platform as an actual platform, not a delivery method. Knowing you’re more
    than just your words. Thinking of your business as a product and storytelling
    business, not a headline and body-copy business. Thinking of your audience as
    finite and building a sustainable business model around that audience — that’s
    going to matter. Thinking about your 10 year plan and not a billion dollar valuation
    — that’s going to matter.</p><p>But before we realign around all those Real Things,
    it will be very bloody. Bloody, and violent, and depressing. Content makers will
    die. They’ll be bought up. They’ll be split apart. Their TV networks will fail.
    Their partnerships will end. In fact, this is already happening.</p><p>We’ll have
    to learn a thousand hard lessons, most of them centered around the idea that if
    you want to make something really great, you can’t think about making it great
    for <em>everyone</em>. You have to make it great for <em>someone</em>. A lot of
    people, but not <em>every person</em>.</p><p>I tend to be a glass half full person.
    I actually think this is an <a href="https://medium.com/@goodberger/peak-content-c89b436dd861#.gribehas7">incredible
    opportunity</a> for the smart people in media. We can <a href="https://twitter.com/joshuatopolsky/status/720056917947719680">unfuck
    ourselves</a>. We can build <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/escaping-the-digital-media-crap-trap">new
    things</a>. We can start over, however we want.</p><p>At the risk of sounding
    self-promotional, that’s what I’ve been working on for the better part of a year.
    I’m only interested in making interesting things for interested people. Want to
    support it or be part of it? Ping me. I love talking.</p>'

    Chen</a>; Photos: Lenny Rachitsky</em></p><p>In 2012, shortly after Airbnb <a
    href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/13/airbnb-acquires-localmind/">acquired</a>
    our startup, I overheard co-founder Joe Gebbia giving guidance to a designer tasked
    with redesigning the homepage. He said, “Build something the internet has never
    seen before.” I vividly remember thinking, <em>What does that even mean? And is
    this the bar for everything around here?</em> Looking back, I’ve come to recognize
    that this mindset has been one of the key ingredients in Airbnb’s historic growth.</p><p>I
    first joined Airbnb as an engineer, then became one of the first members of the
    budding PM team. Back then, there were a couple dozen engineers, a few designers,
    and two very cute dogs. Over the next seven years, as the company scaled to thousands
    of global employees, countless cute dogs, and over $30 billion in value, I took
    on a lot of interesting problems and worked with many incredible people. Since
    leaving a few weeks ago, I’ve been jotting down my biggest lessons from these
    experiences. I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/kylemeyer/status/566366186389004288?s=21">realized</a>
    I should share these lessons with anyone else working to build a company. I can’t
    promise they will all apply to your situation, but they have been core to Airbnb’s
    success.</p><h2>Create strong culture, values, and rituals</h2><p>It’s increasingly
    common for people to choose companies that connect with their personal values,
    both as consumers and employees. From day one, Airbnb has been a company obsessed
    with strong culture, clear values, and quirky rituals. Over the years, I’ve witnessed
    how effective this has been in creating a competitive advantage, allowing the
    company to hire <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/06/greg-greeley-former-amazon-prime-vp-moves-to-airbnb-homes.html">the</a>
    <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/i-joined-airbnb-at-52-and-heres-what-i-learned-about-age-wisdom-and-the-tech-industry">best</a>
    <a href="https://press.airbnb.com/fred-reid-joins-airbnb-as-global-head-of-transportation/">talent</a>,
    move quickly when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/technology/airbnb-super-bowl-ad-trump-travel-ban.html">opportunities</a>
    arise, and push through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/01/airbnb-offers-unconditional-apology-and-50000-insurance-guarantee/">adversity</a>.
    Most importantly, it has made it easy for leaders to stay true to the long-term
    mission and for the team to hold them accountable.</p><p>How did Airbnb create
    a strong culture? Three key ingredients:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Founders obsessed
    with culture.</strong> <a href="https://medium.com/@bchesky/dont-fuck-up-the-culture-597cde9ee9d4">See
    Exhibit A</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWgVWGEuGE">Exhibit
    B</a>. This is fundamental, especially as you scale. It influences who your first
    few hires are (who cocreate the culture) and the values you model (knowingly or
    unknowingly).</p></li><li><p><strong>A strong sense of self.</strong> Airbnb did
    this through a codified set of core values created by a small task force about
    three years in. Airbnb uses these core values when measuring success (are we achieving
    our mission?), hiring (a core values interview group vets all candidates), evaluating
    performance (it’s baked into the peer-review process), and looking at large deals.
    Everyone at the company can recount the values verbatim.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rituals.</strong>
    Cookie time Tuesdays. New hire tea time. Hosted bar. Human tunnels. Fun facts.
    Silly but regular rituals create space for employees to strengthen bonds and bring
    joy to the workplace. Don’t overthink your rituals; experiment and see what sticks.</p></li></ul><p><img

    Airbnb rituals combined — Formal Friday and the human tunnel</em></p><p>Here’s
    an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWgVWGEuGE">excellent video</a> to
    help you get started in building your own culture and values.</p><p><strong>Main
    takeaway:</strong> Be obsessed with your company (and team) culture.</p><h2>Nail
    the problem statement</h2><p>Crafting and aligning on a problem statement is the
    single most important step in solving any problem. I’ve consistently seen simple
    projects with vague problem statements go in circles for weeks and months, while
    complex projects with strong problem statements sail smoothly.</p><p>A few key
    tools that I’ve found helpful:</p><ul><li><p>This <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1541V32QgSwyCFWxtiMIThn-6n-2s7fVWztEWVa970uo/edit">one-pager
    template</a> is something I’ve refined over the years to crystallize the problem
    and opportunity for my team and stakeholders.</p></li><li><p>The situation-complication-resolution
    <a href="https://speakingsherpa.com/how-to-tell-a-business-story-using-the-mckinsey-situation-complication-resolution-scr-framework/">framework</a>
    is extremely helpful in communicating the story to a wider audience.</p></li><li><p>The
    jobs-to-be-done <a href="https://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca">framework</a>
    helps ensure you’re addressing real customer needs.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Main
    takeaway:</strong> Obsess over crystallizing the problem you are trying to solve
    and align your entire team behind it.</p><h2>Set wildly ambitious goals</h2><p>At
    the end of each year, we were often shocked at how close we came to hitting our
    wildly ambitious, seemingly impossible goals. And when I say wildly ambitious,
    I’m making an understatement — Brian, Airbnb’s CEO, is (in)famous for doubling
    our proposed goals, and often pushing us to 10 times the goal. This ambitious
    approach has pushed teams to think bigger and rise to the occasion.</p><p>Five
    key ingredients to doing this well:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Set uncomfortable goals.</strong>
    Our approach was to pick a goal that made us uncomfortable, while also clearly
    understanding why hitting it would be incredible for the business. Two questions
    we asked were 1) What would need to be true for us to hit this goal? and 2) What
    could we accomplish without barriers (budget, people, dependencies, etc.)?</p></li><li><p><strong>Make
    sure someone is directly accountable.</strong> Hitting this goal needs to be an
    individual person’s job. If a number doesn’t have a person’s name next to it,
    it’s not going to happen.</p></li><li><p><strong>Think long-term.</strong> We
    generally looked ahead five to 10 years in order determine that year’s goal, both
    in terms of growth and our mission. Though we didn’t always nail it, we’ve increasingly
    put a lot of thought into the impact our work has on the many stakeholders we
    serve, which was recently crystallized by Brian in an <a href="https://press.airbnb.com/brian-cheskys-open-letter-to-the-airbnb-community-about-building-a-21st-century-company/">open
    letter</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Give a cross-functional team ownership of how
    to achieve the goal.</strong> Your number-one job as a leader is to assemble the
    right team, point team members in the right direction, and stay vigilant in unblocking
    them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Celebrate success, don’t punish failure.</strong>
    Follow through on the original intent of the goal — it was meant to push you,
    not kill you. If you don’t hit the goal but get close, congratulate the team and
    move on to the next goal.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Main takeaway:</strong> When
    setting goals, think bigger.</p><h2>Start with the ideal and work backward</h2><p>A
    variation of Amazon’s <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management?ref=http://www.product-frameworks.com/">working
    backward methodology</a> that I’ve seen work exceptionally well at Airbnb starts
    with envisioning the perfect user experience. A classic example was a project
    code-named Snow White. Inspired by the approach Disney took in developing the
    original <em>Snow White</em> film, the founders began looking at Airbnb not as
    just a website or a service, but as a story with a beginning, middle, and end.</p><p><em>Snow
    White</em> was one of the first films to use the technique of storyboards, and
    thus the team developed a set of storyboards of the ideal guest and host experience,
    identifying key emotional moments along that journey. These storyboards quickly
    became a key tool in identifying our biggest gaps and opportunities, and informed
    the early company strategy. You can read more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/18/airbnb-brian-chesky-snow-white/">here</a>
    and <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3002813/how-snow-white-helped-airbnbs-mobile-mission">here</a>,
    and watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT7Irq8YuSo">great video</a>
    of the team discussing the process.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/8064/1*NPOyVupUp4yNzJeN7-BYNA.jpeg"
    alt="Host and Guest Snow White storyboards"><em>Host and Guest Snow White storyboards</em></p><p>A
    more recent example was when we wanted to make it easier for guests to book a
    home on Airbnb. The process at that point had many steps, including a waiting
    period while the host reviewed the request. Instead of spending months or years
    micro-optimizing individual parts of the funnel, we stepped back and explored
    what the ideal booking experience would look like.</p><p>In this case, it was
    unquestionably a guest being able to instantly book any home without having to
    wait. Initially, it seemed impossible to convince every host to allow guests to
    book without approval. (Only about 5% of bookings were instant at that time.)
    Nonetheless, it became clear that this was where our business needed to go long-term,
    so we put all of our team’s resources behind this bet. Over the course of a couple
    of years, we transformed the marketplace to where the vast majority of bookings
    are now instant.</p><p>A few key ingredients to this process:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Write
    or draw out what the ideal experience looks like, feels like.</strong> In our
    case, before diving into any short-term optimizing, we sketched out the ideal
    booking flow on paper and wrote a sample blog post to describe what we’d announce
    if this were to become real.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Create a framework. *</em>To
    make the problem more tractable, break it down into manageable chunks. In the
    case of instant book, the biggest gap was giving our hosts more control over who
    could book their home instantly. We broke that gap into two types of problems:
    “can” problems (am I able to use it?) and “want” problems (do I want to use it?),
    then worked through them in priority order.</p></li><li><p>*<em>When it feels
    uncomfortable, get more data. *</em>A change this significant is often scary for
    your colleagues or users. Before you give up, look at actual data. Validate your
    assumptions through a quick experiment, user research, or historical data. As
    one data point, many people internally and externally assumed a trip booked instantly
    would lead to a lower-quality experience (less communication, more transactional),
    hurting long-term growth. A quick data dive showed otherwise, and that, along
    with a few other key data points, cleared the path for internal buy-in.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Main
    takeaway:</strong> Look for opportunities to make a step-function change by imagining
    the ideal state and working backward from that.</p><h2>Think of your org design
    as a product</h2><p>As you move up the ranks of leadership at a product org, you
    quickly learn the most important product to get right is how you organize your
    people. How you structure your org can be a force multiplier or a hindrance to
    achieving your mission.</p><p>There are a number of key ingredients to successful
    org design:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Optimize for dedicated cross-functional teams
    with a clear mandate.</strong> In my experience, this is the single most impactful
    thing leaders can do when setting up a team. You want self-contained teams that
    can move autonomously toward an agreed-upon goal. Any missing resource (designer,
    DS, budget), additional cross-team dependency, or conflicting surface area cuts
    the team’s impact immensely. (This is often invisible until later.) Minimize the
    number of times a team will need to meet with or wait for another team. Well-functioning
    teams feel like a black box that outputs regular updates and amazing work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Get
    the goals right.</strong> A lot has been said about goals (for example, <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm">SMART
    goals</a> and <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/john_doerr_why_the_secret_to_success_is_setting_the_right_goals?language=en">OKRs</a>),
    but I think teams still underestimate the power of getting goals right. Setting
    the right goal can be the difference between incredible progress and unending
    churn. Goals should 1) be limited in number — ideally just one or two, 2) have
    quick feedback loops that allow you to see impact immediately, 3) be directly
    connected to top-line business growth, 4) be easily understood, and 5) be uncomfortable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Be
    aware that there is no perfect org design.</strong> At Airbnb, I went through
    almost a dozen reorgs. I’ve never seen a single org plan that addressed every
    issue and made everyone happy. Make sure you’re addressing the biggest pain points,
    future-proofing it as much as you can, and then move forward. The plan will have
    flaws, like overlapping product ownership, two teams with the same key metric,
    or a team owning far too much. Note the flaws and put systems in place to work
    around them. Set expectations that the org will change again in the future.</p></li></ul><p><img

    Martin</a>, drawn free-hand over the course of a day at Airbnb HQ</em></p><p><strong>Main
    takeaway:</strong> Build autonomous units with well-defined goals and get out
    of the way.</p><h2>Maintain a high bar for everything</h2><p>Coming from the startup
    world, I was accustomed to moving quickly, settling for good enough, and thinking
    short-term. There was always too much to do and too little time. Who knew if the
    company would even be around in a year? An early manager at Airbnb instilled in
    me the power of keeping a high bar for my work. Looking back, this one change
    has profoundly impacted my career.</p><p>How to keep the bar high for yourself
    and the team around you:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Emails.</strong> Force yourself
    to look at your email at least once before sending it. There’s always something
    you can cut or clarify. <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-to-write-email-with-military-precision">Here’s</a>
    a style I love, courtesy of the military.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shared docs.</strong>
    Always ask for feedback from at least one person before sharing a doc widely.
    Focus on clean and consistent formatting. Close out comments before sharing with
    execs. Make it easy to scan. Keep pushing yourself to learn to write better.</p></li><li><p><strong>Meetings.</strong>
    Include the primary goal of the meeting in your invite, ideally along with an
    agenda. If you attend a meeting that doesn’t feel productive, call it out. Invite
    as few people as possible. Leave with clear action items. Follow up over email
    with the action items and owners.</p></li><li><p><strong>Presentations.</strong>
    Are you sure you need to do a presentation versus an email? Make sure your audience
    knows the goal of the presentation — are you looking for a decision or general
    feedback, or purely sharing information? It’s not as obvious as you think. Get
    feedback on your presentation; fresh eyes always catch the glaring issues. And
    keep it short — no one has ever wished that presentation went longer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hiring.</strong>
    The people you bring in determine the company you become. My advice is to only
    hire people you feel “hell yes” about. If it’s a maybe, it’s a no. More on this
    advice <a href="https://sivers.org/hellyeah">here</a>.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Main
    takeaway:</strong> Ask yourself and your team these questions often: How could
    we go just a bit bolder? What would it take to make this slightly better? How
    do we make this meeting a little more productive? How do I make this doc or email
    a bit crisper? Could I set the bar a little higher?</p><h2>Keep your teams focused</h2><p>When
    I took over the supply growth team at Airbnb, I found a small team spread across
    a long funnel. They were seeing wins, but were unable to build real momentum.
    I’d seen the same thing when I took over a team responsible for improving trip
    quality. In both cases, reducing the problem space and providing a more focused
    mandate resulted in gains in impact and morale. Aim for teams to have a focused
    problem to rally around and obsess about.</p><p>In the case of supply growth,
    our solution was to first divide the team into focused units (a team driving referrals,
    a team owning top-of-funnel organic growth, a team owning performance marketing,
    etc.), and then grow each team with resources appropriate to that problem space.
    In the case of trip quality, we dedicated a quarter at a time to a specific aspect
    of quality (host response rate, guest review rate, etc.). Once we found large
    opportunity, we doubled down in the subsequent quarter.</p><p>If you apply this
    lesson to your product, allowing users to focus on the task at hand is one of
    the most powerful tools in increasing the number of successful user experiences.
    Some of the biggest guest conversion gains I saw at Airbnb came from simple tweaks
    that gave users fewer things to think about — things like opening listings in
    new tabs (avoids getting lost while exploring), extending session length (you
    don’t need to log in as often), and removing links within the payments flow (avoids
    distractions). We saw the same thing on the host side, from always having a “recommended”
    tag when presenting a set of options, to defaulting settings based on host persona,
    to adding inline tips so users don’t bounce. Don’t underestimate the power of
    focus.</p><p><strong>Main takeaway:</strong> Focus. Focus. Focus.</p><p>Thinking
    back to what Joe suggested to that one designer many years ago, Airbnb truly has
    built something the internet has never seen before. It’s been an incredible experience
    watching the company grow and evolve through the years. I feel grateful for the
    opportunity to have been a part of that ride for so long and to have worked with
    the brilliant, kind, and driven people who walk the halls of Airbnb every day.</p><h2>Takeaways</h2><ul><li><p>Be
    obsessed with your company (and team) culture.</p></li><li><p>Crystallize the
    problem you want to solve and align your team behind it.</p></li><li><p>When setting
    goals, think bigger.</p></li><li><p>Make step-function change by imagining the

  :title: Why Nothing Scares Me In Business
  :content: <h2>I’m going to tell you why I lack fear in business.</h2><p><em>It’s
    because I fear something so much.</em></p><p>I fear the health and well-being
    of my family so much, and I mean I’m crippled by it. Hence, why, when you’re a
    grown-ass man and you get up during a vacation and go to some weird corner and
    pray for your mom to wake up. You know? This really happens to me.</p><p>I am
    so fearful of the health and well-being of the 10 to 15 people closest to me in
    my life. It is disproportionately the most important thing in the world to me
    that it just makes everything else so easy.</p><p>The thought of losing all of
    my money is often so weirdly exciting because I know I have the talent to rise
    back up. Money doesn’t mean anything to me. I want legacy, influence, and impact.</p><p>I
    thought that would go away when I had kids, and it has to some degree, but not
    really. I think that’s how it plays out in other people’s lives right? You’re
    scared to die? Scared to lose, scared to try? Not me.</p><p>That’s why I’m so
    in tune with my feelings. I’m all in. I dream of buying the Jets or having somebody
    say, “This is it. This was the guy. He was the best entrepreneur of this generation.”
    Then I think about that title being anointed upon me and then immediately getting
    a phone call and hearing that my mom died in a car accident. None of it would
    matter.</p><p>I would be devastated. Then I see how I feel and since I feel awful,
    well then why in the world would I get caught up in the money or the business?
    You only have one life. I live mine in the moment. I care deeply about every human
    interaction I have. In those meetings, I’m not thinking about business, or money,
    or success. I’m thinking about life. About what really matters. About the individual
    standing right in front of me.</p><p>There’s definitely personal vulnerabilities
    that I have that I’m aware of, but boy, I am super not scared when it comes to
    business. I’ve been doing it my whole life. I’ve always been good at it. There
    is no reason to fear money or a meeting or a deal. Why does it matter? You can’t
    sell the unsellable. You can’t change the way the other person treats you in the
    moment. You can’t change their perception, or circumstance or what they had for
    breakfast that morning that has put them in a bad mood. So why let it bother you?
    You have to deploy understanding, empathy and compassion. You have to be you,
    and not be afraid to fail.</p><p>Maybe it’s my DNA, but I also think it’s a learned
    behavior. I’ve seen it happen with those around me and I’ve watched them grow.
    My assistant <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tyler/">@tyler</a> has become
    an absolute monster when it comes to his confidence. After having him work at
    Vayner for year and a half, he’s now shaking hands and doing deals with the biggest
    names in business. It just takes time. Confidence builds and reality set in. You
    lose your fear of not doing, not trying, not caring what other people think.</p><p>You
    become free, and then the fun really begins to start.</p><blockquote><h1><a href="http://ctt.ec/0i0n8">*Once

  :title: Why Trello Failed to Build a $1 Billion+ Business
  :content: "<p>In 2011, Joel Spolsky launched his company Fog Creek’s new product
    at TechCrunch Disrupt called Trello. It looked a lot like a whiteboard with sticky
    notes translated into a web browser and an iPhone App. Instead of physically moving
    a sticky note on a whiteboard, you could drag and drop cards on a board from your
    web browser.</p><p>Within days, Trello succeeded in getting 131,000 eyeballs.
    <a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2011/09/15/should-you-launch-at-a-conference/\">22%
    of them signed up</a>. The vision for Trello was to create a wide product that
    was so simple and useful, just about anyone could use it. It caught on like wildfire.</p><p>It’s
    also** **why Trello ultimately had to sell to Atlassian for $425 million when
    it could have become the next $1 billion SaaS application.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2012/01/06/how-trello-is-different/\">blog
    post</a> Spolsky wrote a couple months after launch, Joel presciently touched
    on the biggest challenge ahead:</p><p><em>“Making a major horizontal product that’s
    useful in any walk of life is almost impossible to pull off. You can’t charge
    very much, because you’re competing with other horizontal products that can amortize
    their development costs across a huge number of users. It’s high risk, high reward.”</em></p><p>Trello
    was successful building this horizontal product, achieving rapid growth to tens
    of millions of users and an acquisition of hundreds of millions of dollars. However,
    the one thing Trello didn’t do a good job of was keeping track of its paying customers.</p><p>Trello
    was so focused on building its free customer base first and monetizing later;
    by the time it looked to its paid subscribers, it was too late — they’d already
    moved on. While that makes Trello a perfect complement to Atlassian’s suite of
    enterprise productivity tools, it hampered the company from growing further on
    its own.</p><p>Let’s talk about the opportunity that Trello missed, and what it
    could have done <em>instead.</em></p><h2>Why Trello Had to Sell</h2><p>Trello
    is organized around a “kanban board” concept. Kanban was a system for lean manufacturing
    that Toyota popularized in the 1940s. The basic idea was that each “card” represented
    a product, part, or inventory. When a card moved around a board, it meant that
    something had been physically moved from a supplier to a factory.</p><p>In practice,
    it looks like this:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*k6-Lxz-oyiAPvMSr.jpg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>When Trello first started out, it was really technically challenging
    to create a board in a web browser where you could collaboratively drag and drop
    cards into lists. A lot of other SaaS tools at the time were big databases with
    a visual interface built on top (think: Salesforce). This basically created an
    architecture where you structured data in terms of leads, customers, or tasks.</p><p>Trello
    came at this from the opposite direction. The product vision was to strip everything
    down and build around the visual idea of cards on boards. To get this to work,
    Trello implemented a <a href=\"https://blog.fogcreek.com/the-trello-tech-stack/\">bleeding-edge
    stack</a>. The single page web app basically worked as a shell that pulled all
    of the data from the servers in less than half a second, at under 250 kilobytes.
    After a user visited for the first time, they then cached the page so Trello would
    load even faster.</p><p>They built their servers on top of Node and used MongoDB
    to store data so that the web app would load really fast. Everytime a user dragged
    a card to a new list, or changed the entry on a board, Trello pushed this data
    to every other browser with the board open almost instantly.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*_tAbSWB5GytzdBb0.jpg\"
    alt=\"Trello Architecture\"><em>Trello Architecture</em></p><p>The result was
    breathtakingly simple. You made a change to a board by dragging and dropping a
    card, and that change was reflected everywhere else in the world.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3798/0*uYk_h6nhYUp0-Lev.jpg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>All of this stuff was new at the time, and gave Trello a lot of
    runway. But by 2016, it wasn’t as hard to a build beautiful and responsive web
    app like Trello, and you started seeing Kanban boards everywhere:</p><ul><li><strong>GitHub

    alt=\"\"></p><p>Justin Rosenstein, co-founder of Asana — one of Trello’s biggest
    competitors — said, “We definitely give Trello full credit. That is clearly the
    product that has done a good job pioneering this view.” But Justin was equally
    unapologetic about copy-catting Trello’s board feature: “We see Trello as a feature,
    not a product.”</p><p>Trello might have become a $1B+ business if it looked like
    a “system of record” application — the single-source of truth for a company. Imagine
    if you could use Trello not just to track your marketing funnel, but to move information
    from your marketing board to your sales pipeline and product roadmap. Instead
    of having a separate Trello board for each team, you’d have a big board for the
    entire company.</p><p>Trello never became this “system of record.” It was a strong
    visual metaphor that the competition ultimately copied. The Kanban board turned
    out to be a really cool UX feature, but not a difficult one to replicate.</p><p>In
    SaaS, you don’t win by getting there first or having the best idea. You win by
    continually solving the problem better. When you build a feature that’s extremely
    popular or successful, the competition will steal it.</p><p>Trello could have
    doubled down on upselling individual consumers to paid plans. They could have
    focused on building features for SMB customers. Or they could have expanded into
    the enterprise faster. Any one of these things would have led to a $1B+ valuation.
    Let’s talk about what Trello could have done with each path, starting with its
    consumer plan.</p><h2>#1) Trello Didn’t Monetize Free Fast Enough</h2><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2114/0*B9sV9Hl9oVX54XTO.png\" alt=\"Chart
    of Trello’s user growth based on publicly available data.\"><em>Chart of Trello’s
    user growth based on publicly available data.</em></p><p>It’s possible to build
    a $1B+ company with a freemium business model targeted toward consumers. In 2013,
    Dropbox was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/19/if-dropboxs-2013-revenue-is-200m-an-8b-valuation-is-pretty-steep/\">valued
    at $8B on $200M in revenue</a> with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/13/dropbox-hits-200-million-users-and-announces-new-products-for-businesses/\">200M
    users</a> six years after launch. This was before Dropbox had even launched a
    business plan — the company’s revenue primarily came from upselling free users
    to a $10/month plan.</p><p>Three years after launch, Trello’s growth in users
    looked on track to explode past Dropbox’s levels, at <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2015/09/15/trello-hits-10m-users-adds-evernote-github-salesforce-slack-integrations-in-business-class/\">10
    million in 2015</a> (Dropbox had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/20/dropbox-4-million-user/\">four
    million three years after launch</a>). But Trello had a much harder time upselling
    free customers to its paid “Trello Gold” plan.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://blog.trello.com/introducing-trello-gold-board-backgrounds-stickers-and-more\">2013
    blog post </a>that announced the launch of Trello Gold highlighted three main
    reasons users should pay $5/month for Trello:</p><ul><li><p>Customizable board
    backgrounds</p></li><li><p>250-megabyte attachments for each card in Trello (vs.
    10 megabytes on the free plan)</p></li><li><p>Stickers and custom emoji</p></li></ul><p>While
    everyone likes emojis, it’s not a good enough reason to spend money on software.
    Dropbox’s free plan gives away 2 GB of space. Its paid plan delivers 1TB of space
    — 50x what users get for free.</p><p>Trello’s value proposition is harder to locate
    than Dropbox, which is exactly why Trello should have figured out early what features
    individual consumers were willing to pay for.</p><h2>Solution: Dig Into the Freemium
    Use-Cases</h2><p>Instead, Trello focused on building a freemium, horizontal product
    that everyone could use, and chose to figure out monetization later.</p><p>Instead
    of focusing on building a wide product for everyone, Trello should have dug deeper
    into its use cases in the beginning to figure out why people were signing up,
    what they were using the product for, and what people found so valuable that they’d
    be willing to pay to use Trello.</p><p>If you have a broad product with a lot
    of applications, dive into all of the different use cases first:</p><ul><li><p>Is
    there a competitor that’s able to do this — or is already doing it today?</p></li><li><p>What’s
    the revenue potential for people using this use case?</p></li></ul><p>By doing
    research around <a href=\"https://producthabits.com/dont-build-your-product-without-knowing-your-customers-first/\">your
    customer base and your competitor’s customers</a>, you can segment out the use
    cases with the highest lifetime value.</p><p>Let’s say Trello found out that of
    its freemium user base, lawyers, real estate agents, and <a href=\"https://medium.com/did-you-know-the-journal-blog/almost-every-product-design-resource-you-need-to-understand-the-tech-ecosystem-3d734f9c1a22\">designers
    </a>had the highest revenue potential. They might have learned that while designers
    want access to a calendar in their Trello boards, lawyers want read-only boards
    that they can share with clients.</p><p>These were features that Trello already
    included in its business plan, but didn’t emphasize in its marketing because they
    wanted to keep a wide focus. Instead, Trello could have created a separate landing
    page to re-target free customers and upsell them to a paid plan according to their
    specific use cases.</p><p>When you have a wide product, it’s especially important
    to dig into the individual use cases for your product, because it allows you to
    build specialized features according to those verticals. If you don’t want to
    build your business off of a freemium consumer product, you have options — you
    can move up the ladder and build around SMBs.</p><h2>#2) Trello’s Product Wasn’t
    Sticky Enough for SMBs</h2><p>Even without a really valuable consumer business,
    Trello still could have become the default workflow tool in SaaS by doubling-down
    on the SMB market. The problem was that Trello didn’t always make itself central
    enough to a company’s workflow to justify paying for it by the seat.</p><p>The
    first paid plan that Trello launched was its <a href=\"https://blog.trello.com/introducing-business-class\">Business
    Class</a> for small-to-medium sized businesses in 2013. They charged a flat rate
    price of $200/year per organization before moving to a more traditional per-seat
    SaaS pricing model.</p><p>Trello Business Class costs $10 per user/month (billed
    annually) and you get:</p><ul><li><p>Unlimited integrations across boards</p></li><li><p>Additional
    collaboration features</p></li><li><p>Read-only views and privacy settings</p></li></ul><p>When
    David Cancel, co-founder of Drift, put the company’s <a href=\"http://blog.drift.com/how-to-price-your-product\">annual
    Trello bill on a slide</a> — $1,700 — the entire team at Drift was shocked. As
    David says, “There are only a couple of people using [Trello] day-in, day-out.
    Meanwhile, however, we were being charged based on the number of people that we
    had in the paid plan. So clearly there was a disconnect between the price we were
    paying and the value we were getting.”</p><p>David downgraded his team from the
    paid plan to the free plan.</p><p>In a <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2016/05/23/trello-get-serious-about-big-businesses-as-it-passes-1-1-million-daily-users-and-triples-sales/\">Forbes
    article</a> Trello CEO Michael Pryor said: “I don’t want people to spend 10 hours
    in Trello every day, we don’t sell ads so we don’t do better engaging more of
    your time like a social media platform.”</p><p>That’s okay. When you’re charging
    SMBs by the seat, you don’t *have *to optimize your product around getting users
    to log in more. But you have to find some other way to demonstrate the value of
    paying for your product across the company.</p><p>So, what should Trello have
    done instead?</p><h2>Solution: Build Out Better Integrations for SMBs</h2><p>Trello
    could have created a stickier business product by making sure that it was so deeply
    integrated with other tools, teams couldn’t rip it out.</p><p>Imagine the ability
    to open and close GitHub issues inside of Trello. Imagine if all of your Salesforce
    leads automatically opened and closed on a Trello board based on what you did
    inside of Salesforce. Trello would have become the dashboard for all of the other
    tools a company used — something that would have been insanely valuable.</p><p>Instead,
    Trello’s main features were copy-catted. When asked about <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2016/09/14/github-launches-a-trello-competitor-pull-request-reviews-redesigned-profile-pages/\">building
    out boards for visually managing issues</a>, GitHub’s VP of Product Engineering
    explained that: “Everyone was expecting it to be there and asking questions about
    why we didn’t have it.” So GitHub built boards.</p><p>If you’re building a horizontal
    SaaS app like Trello, segment your users by integration:</p><ul><li><p>What API
    integrations are people using?</p></li><li><p>How much data is coming into the
    product and how much is going out?</p></li></ul><p>That gives a valuable lens
    into another type of use case for your product. If a lot of data is pouring from
    your product to a different one, it’s a sign that the competition is heating up.
    By building out better integrations and new product features, you can pre-empt
    the competition from stepping on your turf.</p><p>The SaaS SMB market is hyper-competitive,
    and it’s easier than ever before for businesses to switch from one solution to
    another. You either have to outmaneuver the competition, or build staying power
    by moving upmarket to the enterprise.</p><h2>#3) Trello Didn’t Build for the Enterprise</h2><p>Moving
    upstream and <a href=\"https://www.enterpriseready.io/\">targeting the enterprise
    market</a> is a proven model for SaaS. Slack is doing it with the launch of its
    Enterprise Grid. Trello could have built a $1B+ business by doing the same: moving
    into the enterprise market faster.</p><p>Less than a year after Trello launched
    its enterprise sales strategy in 2015, the company hit a milestone of $10 million
    in ARR. <a href=\"https://blog.heresy.io/an-interview-with-trellos-vp-sales-kristen-habacht-1d477d74945f\">In
    an interview</a>, Trello’s VP of Sales, Kristen Habacht writes that Trello follows
    a pretty basic land-and-expand enterprise sales strategy:</p><p><em>“For our enterprise
    team we’ll look at [customers] who have really high Trello user counts. A lot
    of our outbound sales strategy is just reaching out to those accounts and saying,
    “Hey you have 2,000+ people on Trello, who can we talk to about that?”</em></p><p>$10
    million in ARR isn’t anything to sneeze at. The problem with Trello’s enterprise
    sales strategy is that it was *only *built on top of the reality that people in
    a company were already using Trello. A company’s sales, marketing, and product
    teams might each use a bunch of different Trello boards. But what’s harder is
    organizing the entire company around Trello.</p><h2>Solution: Become the System
    of Record for the Enterprise</h2><p>The question that Trello should have been
    asking itself is, “How do we integrate with higher-end systems that larger companies
    are using and make ourselves indispensable to companies by becoming a core part
    of their workflow?”</p><p>One way to do it is to take the Slack strategy. As Slack
    grew, the company was razor-focused on how it spread from individuals, to teams,
    to entire companies — catching like wildfire.</p><p>The big challenge that Slack
    found is that unlike a sales CRM or a marketing analytics tool, almost everyone
    on a small team has veto power over a productivity tool. So, Slack spent six months
    in private beta observing their customer base and educating them around the need
    for an internal communication tool in the first place. They optimized their onboarding
    flow around a <a href=\"http://firstround.com/review/From-0-to-1B-Slacks-Founder-Shares-Their-Epic-Launch-Strategy/\">north
    star metric of 2,000 messages sent</a> within an organization. Today, 93% of those
    companies are still using Slack.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/slack-launches-slack-grid-an-interview-with-stewart-butterfield/\">vision
    behind Slack’s enterprise product</a> is that it allows organizations to “create
    more or less any kind of structure” with Slack. Functionally, Slack is a different
    product for the Enterprise. Teams within a company can organize themselves into
    “workspaces” and form divisions according to their organizational structure. Because
    Slack was so focused on figuring out how and why its product spread from small
    teams, to departments, to larger organizations, it was able to pinpoint key problems
    for the enterprise and solve them with the <a href=\"https://slackhq.com/introducing-slack-enterprise-grid-ccb343380fbb\">Enterprise
    Grid</a>.</p><p>Large enterprise companies love flexibility and configurability.
    Like Slack, Trello could have carved out a seat at the enterprise table by allowing
    large companies to configure Trello to their organizational charts. Trello’s advantage
    is that it’s already an extremely versatile and easy-to-use product. By providing
    companies structure between departments, Trello might have worked as the connective
    tissue holding a company together.</p><h2>Congratulations, Trello</h2><p>Hindsight,
    of course, is 20/20. While I’ve spent most of this post talking about Trello’s
    missed opportunity, we shouldn’t forget that building a SaaS business that’s worth
    over $10M, let alone one that’s worth $425M, is a huge accomplishment.</p><p>Trello
    and the team at Fog Creek paid for Trello out of pocket. Trello has been a huge
    success since the moment Joel launched it at TechCrunch Disrupt. The team grew
    it to 500,000 users within two years, and 4.75M users within four years — before
    raising any money. They built an amazing product that was way ahead of its time.
    It was simple, elegant, and easy-to-use.</p><p>Last year, I tweeted:</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2524/0*N5JzRScOBDbkJ9k9.png\" alt=\"\"></p><p>That’s
    the impact that Trello has had on SaaS, and you see it everywhere, from GitHub
    to Jira.</p><p>But if you wan’t to build the next $1B+ SaaS app, you have to remember
    to constantly evolve on top of your product. Don’t build around any one single
    feature that the competition can rip out. Alternatively, make that one single
    feature so deeply integrated into everyone else’s product that it’s pointless
    for anyone else to copycat it.</p><p>Above all, you need to go deep into understanding
    who your customers are early on, because that’s how you’ll know what to implement
    into your product and where to take it next. Doing the research and the hard work
    is the only way to keep your product relevant in the market.</p><iframe src=\"https://medium.com/media/98ca70367288057a041f4d641ba4ed35\"

  :content: '<p>What it takes to succeed in a new decade.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9216/1*_XUakgeIJVs_dSrFXXGgOw.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>If you want to live a successful life in 2020 and beyond, you need
    to adopt a new set of skills.</p><p>Hell, you’ll need to learn these skills just
    to keep up.</p><p>Society is fragmenting into two parallel realities. In one reality,
    you have infinite upside and opportunity. In the other reality, you’ll continue
    to see the gap between your standard of living and those at the top grow more
    and more.</p><p>At this point, you don’t have much of a choice if you want to
    have a profitable and meaningful career or business.</p><p>You have to become
    a part of this new game we’re playing. You have to join the new economy and let
    go of old ways of thinking.</p><p>Most importantly, you can’t make excuses for
    yourself.</p><p>Are people getting lost in the shuffle of current times? Absolutely.
    Is it their fault? Not necessarily. It’s a deep and complicated issue.</p><p>Needless
    to say, once you know the truth, you have to put those insights into action. Well,
    you don’t have to do anything. Your choice.</p><p>Do you want to join the people
    on their way to the top or do you want to sit and watch all traditional forms
    of employment and upward mobility fade away right in front of your eyes?</p><p>If
    you’re still with me, here are the skills you need to thrive in today’s times
    and beyond.</p><h2>The Ability to Acquire the Currency of Today’s Times</h2><p>We
    live in an attention economy. Those with the most eyeballs on their work, projects,
    ideas, etc, tend to win. You need to learn how to attract attention because, without
    it, even a great idea can fall flat.</p><p>Notice I said to <em>attract</em> attention.</p><p>If
    you want to build an audience, start a movement, gain loyal customers, or even
    <a href="http://ayotheauthor.com/attract-amazing-people/">attract the right people
    into your life</a>, you’re better off gaining a following as a natural byproduct
    of the quality of your work plus the authentic personality needed to properly
    display the work.</p><p>We’re all flooded with people, products, and companies
    who are trying to get in our face and interrupt us — ads, propaganda in the media,
    and a slew of “influencers” who furiously create fluffy content to convince us
    to join their tribes.</p><p>To get attention the right way, just be so awesome
    that continuing to engage with you seems like the obvious thing to do. Of course,
    traditional marketing skills are necessary, but marketing works much better when
    it’s connected to quality and authenticity.</p><p>What does this mean for you?</p><p>Regardless
    of what you’re trying to accomplish, understand that ‘creating content’ is a concept
    that applies to almost anyone.</p><p>Display your knowledge, insights, personal
    experience to the world. You don’t even need to have a business in mind before
    you do this. You can do this as an employee who never plans to quit their job.</p><p>Start
    putting yourself out there, get the attention first, and you can figure out what
    do to with it later.</p><h3>Some examples are:</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Blogging</strong>
    — Even if you don’t want to become a writer, using a blog to share thoughts about
    your industry can attract customers, employers, investors, and people who want
    to be in your network</p></li><li><p><strong>Video</strong> — You can start putting
    video content online by simply turning your iPhone camera to your face and talking.
    Take an example like Tai Lopez. Love him or hate him, he started a 9 figure company
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv1RJTHf5fk">using a video he shot with
    a phone</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social Media</strong> — Here’s a great example
    of this. <a href="https://twitter.com/roncaruthers">Ron Caruthers</a> is a personal
    finance expert. He does these amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/roncaruthers/status/1161835328803524608">Twitter
    threads</a> breaking down complex topics in simple ways for “laypeople” to understand.
    He’s not trying to become a social media influencer, but his savvy use of social
    platforms helps him build his business.</p></li></ul><h2>The Skill That Helps
    You Become the Best in the World</h2><p>In one of the best self-help books I’ve
    ever read, <em>How to Fail at Almost Anything and Still Win Big</em> by Scott
    Adams, he talks about the concept of <em>skill stacking</em> to put yourself in
    a position to be one of the best in the world at what you do.</p><p>It’s hard
    to be the best in the world at <strong>one skill.</strong></p><p>But, if you learn
    how to combine skills in a unique way, you create a rare skill set. The rarer
    your skillset, the more ‘<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124">career
    capital</a>’ you have. Career capital gives you more freedom, helps you command
    higher rates, and gives you the upper hand because you’re harder to replace.</p><p>Scott
    Adams is the cartoonist behind <em>Dilbert.</em> Scott will tell you he’s a decent
    drawer, not the best. He’s funny, but not the funniest. His time spent in corporate
    culture gave him fodder for the strip as well as the business skills needed to
    promote himself. Combine these skills together, and you get a unique skill set
    that creates a unique comic strip.</p><p>Create your ‘talent stack’ to stand out.
    First, play games you can win. Focus on strengthening your natural talents and
    capabilities as a foundation first, then branch out to <a href="https://medium.com/@Chef_BoyarDEJI/t-shaped-knowledge-how-to-jump-to-the-top-10-percent-of-your-field-783a2027a080">building
    ancillary skills.</a> Doing this will help you <a href="https://medium.com/mind-cafe/7-productivity-superpowers-few-people-have-that-you-can-use-to-set-yourself-apart-25e81f03a771">multiply
    the effect of your effort.</a></p><h2>The Skill that Maximizes Your Time</h2><p>In
    a world where attention spans are shrinking, the ability to focus is at a premium.
    If you can learn to block out specific periods of time and enter a flow state
    while you work, you’ll become <em>the right kind of productive.</em></p><p>Working
    four hours per day on activities that move the needle, creates more output than
    a distracted 8 hour day.</p><p>If you focus, and focus hard, on doing the 20 percent
    of the work that creates 80 percent of the results, everything else will fall
    into place. Some say the 80/20 rule isn’t narrow enough — more like 95/5.</p><p>People
    ask me about my writing ‘tricks’ all the time. I have one trick. I’ve entered
    a flow state and used it to produce words almost every day for five years. That’s
    it. This one routine has led to all the positive outcomes I’ve had when it comes
    to <a href="https://medium.com/@Chef_BoyarDEJI/the-simple-secret-to-making-money-online-no-special-talented-required-845d11264b9f">making
    money online</a>.</p><p>The steps to success are straightforward but require focus
    and discipline. That’s it.</p><p>In your chase to ‘be productive’ coupled with
    your need to ‘know all the tricks’ you move further away from your goals.</p><p>The
    bar for discipline, focus, and the ability to follow directions is low. Exceed
    it and you’ll win.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6706/0*WR4DO2YduEmEJjKK"

    produces positive outcomes.</a> That’s it.</p><h3>Some examples are:</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Self-awareness</strong>
    — Most people can’t be honest with themselves. Their rationalizations and ego
    get in the way of their own success. If you know who you are — both your strengths
    and your limitations, you can stack the odds in your favor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Humility</strong>
    — Your ego tells you that you should be further along than you are, even though
    you haven’t done the work. Fear is actually a form of self-centeredness. You think
    you’re so important that the world cares if you fail. It doesn’t. Counterintuitively,
    true humility is the ability to live the life you deserve by putting your ego
    to the side and displaying your talents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Patience and stability</strong>
    — If you have the ability to execute on your ideas, without too many unnecessary
    ups and downs, you’ll get the results you want. The combination of certainty in
    your long-term goals and proactivity towards short-term actions combined with
    the ability to remain detached from short-term results gives you <a href="http://ayotheauthor.com/productivity-superpowers/">productivity
    superpowers</a>.</p></li></ul><h2>The Skill That Helps Keeps You From Getting
    Sidetracked.</h2><p>Staying positive and focusing on the upside the world has
    to offer sets you apart from the vast majority of society. Society is polluted
    with noise. From the ‘sky is falling’ narrative to the keeping up with the Joneses
    mentality to putting a major emphasis on minor things, most people get thrown
    off too often to succeed.</p><p>The prescription for how to reduce your signal
    to noise ratio is simple:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Limit news consumption</strong>
    — The incentive structure is such that the media has to create emotionally arousing,
    often negative, content to get clicks. By the nature of the industry, they simply
    can’t give you objective narratives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Follow (a few) smart
    people</strong> — My blogging knowledge comes from two or three people, tops.
    I consume a lot of information, but once I find a truly valid source, I quadruple
    down on it. You’re better off following advice verbatim from a few extremely successful
    people than you are listening to everyone.</p></li><li><p><strong>Focus on your
    output</strong> — You can only control yourself. Be the change you want to see
    in the world. Exhaust your resources first before looking for someone to save
    you. Measure your results by your effort. The noise of the world will tell you
    to focus on everyone else but yourself, which is what almost everyone does. Basic
    personal responsibility for your life will dramatically reduce your noise addiction.</p></li></ul><p>Stay
    on this journey long enough, and you’ll realize 99 percent of all information
    is noise. Counterintuitively, you only need one percent worth of truly valuable
    information to <a href="https://medium.com/p/the-secret-to-changing-your-life-968e5ae154b">change
    your entire life.</a></p><h2>The Ability to Find Your Tribe</h2><p>Don’t ‘network’
    with people. Connect with people.</p><p>You’d be surprised at how many people
    you can connect with if you focus on interacting with people you actually find
    interesting. That, plus putting yourself out there and displaying your knowledge
    for the world to see, will make connecting with people, especially influential
    people, much easier.</p><p>When someone “reaches out to me” so they can “pick
    my brain” without having put much work in upfront, I have no interest in connecting
    with them. When I come across people who do work hard and also, you know, seem
    genuinely interested in my work, I bend over backward to help them.</p><p>I know
    dozens of top writers. How did I meet them? I attracted them by writing great
    content or I showed them love without asking for anything in return. I share their
    stuff on social media because it’s actually good. I’ll write reviews for products
    I truly love. When you operate this way, a network naturally unfolds as a result
    of it.</p><p>There are so many simple actions you can take, from the right headspace,
    that can help you connect with others:</p><ul><li><p>Buy and review their products</p></li><li><p>Leave
    thoughtful comments on their work</p></li><li><p>Share their work online</p></li><li><p>Send
    people notes, without asking for anything, saying thank you for the quality of
    their work</p></li><li><p>Participate in places where you can find like-minded
    peers, e.g., posting content about a certain niche on social media</p></li></ul><p>Once
    people know you’re legitimate and are one of the rare people in society who aren’t
    looking to take, take, take, they’re glad to connect with you.</p><h2>Standing
    Out in a Sea of Resumes</h2><p>Jeff Goins, a writer I looked up to in my early
    days, used to talk about this concept of the portfolio life. Instead of having
    a resume filled with boring bullet points, you should be able to display what
    you’ve done.</p><p>When I Google you, a digital trail of your accomplishments
    should pop up:</p><ul><li><p>Content and social media profiles</p></li><li><p>Projects
    you’ve done</p></li><li><p>News articles and media about you</p></li></ul><p>James
    Altucher once said, “Books are the new business cards.” In general, your portfolio
    of work online is your business card.</p><p>I forgot where I heard this, but there’s
    also the phrase “Every company is a media company and every person has a personal
    brand.”</p><p>Guess what? If you haven’t actively focused on creating a brand,
    you have a brand, but it’s not a good one.</p><p>Again, no need to “become an
    influencer.”</p><p>But do intentionally leave breadcrumbs about what you’ve been
    up to. As Austin Kleon discusses in his book, Show Your Work, you want to not
    only put projects out there but give people** behind the scenes access** to what
    you’re doing.</p><p>Document the steps you’re taking to improve your life, career,
    or business in real-time to naturally build this online presence and portfolio.
    Imagine you’re choosing between two potential employees on LinkedIn. One has a
    resume. The other has status updates about their field, videos, blog posts, and
    little demos of their skills scattered across their profile.</p><p>Who would <em>you</em>
    want to hire?</p><p>Exactly.</p><h2>One of the Most Underrated Skills of All Time</h2><p>Writing
    well is a superpower.</p><p>Even if you don’t want to become a writer, learning
    to write will improve your life, business, and career.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Writing
    forces you to articulate your thoughts. Often, you’ll think you know about a subject,
    but writing about it makes it clear whether or not you do. Writing helps you <a
    href="https://medium.com/publishous/7-psychological-superpowers-few-people-have-that-you-can-use-to-set-yourself-apart-925fcee821d4">become
    a better thinker and decision-maker</a>.</p><p>Many people don’t ascend in their
    life or career because they don’t know how to communicate their own values. They
    have communications issues in general — how many poorly thought out emails have
    you received in your life?</p><p>Every CEO and company should have a blog. Top
    employees can use blogging to display their knowledge in the field. Every individual
    should have a blog to practice their critical thinking and storytelling skills.</p><p>You
    don’t have to be Hemingway.</p><p>Anyone can learn the following:</p><ul><li><p>Basic
    business blogging</p></li><li><p>Copywriting</p></li><li><p>Succinct and persuasive
    emails</p></li><li><p>Basic storytelling frameworks</p></li><li><p>Essay writing</p></li></ul><p>Look
    at how pervasive writing is in your life. Every advertisement has words. It drives
    the narratives of your favorite shows and movies. Email is still the primary channel
    for business communication.</p><p>The skill of writing is so universal I’d be
    hard-pressed to find a person who wouldn’t benefit from getting better at it.</p><h2>The
    Ability to be (Truly) Authentic</h2><p>When it comes to this attention economy
    we’re in, <em>trying to become an influencer</em> is futile.</p><p>Never start
    with a goal to be famous or get attention. Focus on becoming the best version
    of yourself, <strong>in public,</strong> and nothing more.</p><p>The world is
    too competitive to just rely on objectivity to get ahead. Being your authentic
    self is the only way to get ahead because nobody can compete with you when it
    comes to being you.</p><p>You learn the rules of your game so you can break them.
    You study the basic techniques and strategies of your field then combine them
    with your unique insights and skills. And you <em>never</em> play a character
    to get ahead.</p><p>Ramit Sethi wrote an amazing <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/please-stop-writing-about-how-vulnerable-you-are/">article
    about fake vulnerability.</a> He talks about online creators who intentionally
    overshare parts of their life and self-deprecate too much to come ass as authentic.
    This approach only works if you’re the type of person prone to sharing that way.</p><p>You
    become authentic by forgetting about arbitrary authenticity standards.</p><p>You
    build the skill of becoming authentic by pushing yourself to be more of yourself
    over time. Look at some of the most popular people in many different fields —
    many are polarizing. Because their views don’t cater to everyone and even piss
    some people off, they create a** loyal following.**</p><p>You don’t force people
    to join your tribe. You attract like-minded people into your tribe. The same rings
    true for networks, customers, fans, employers, and everything between. You want
    to draw the right situations into your life and you can’t do that unless you’re
    upfront about who you are, what you want, and your view of the way the world works.</p><h2>Entrepreneurial
    Thinking</h2><p>The days of rising up the ladder as a corporate robot are dead.
    Without the ability to think on your feet and sell your ideas (employees still
    sell their services to employers) you’re dead in the water.</p><p>Whether or not
    you want to start a business, you should <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zigHh7t33yc&t=1s">treat
    your life like a business.</a></p><ul><li><p><strong>You are a product</strong>
    — People fail in life when they sit around and hope the right situations fall
    into their lap. Why would people ‘buy into you’ if you’re not packaging yourself
    like an offer?</p></li><li><p><strong>You’re the head of marketing and sales</strong>
    — Half the items I mentioned on this list involve displaying your knowledge online.
    Why? Gone are the days of being an anonymous 8 x 11 sheet of paper, resume, and
    winning.</p></li><li><p><strong>You’re the PR department</strong> — For better
    or worse, almost everything you do in life lives on a permanent record thanks
    to the internet. Again, don’t pander, but understand your behavior creates a ‘brand’
    for you, whether you like it or not.</p></li></ul><p>The top employees of this
    century won’t be salaried employees. They’ll be entrepreneurial gig type works
    who have a portfolio, contract with many companies, and use media to boost their
    profiles.</p><p>You don’t need to own a factory and hold tons of inventory to
    own an actual business anymore. Mostly, you need a computer. Many 7 figures companies
    are run with 3–4 employees, total.</p><p>Many just use a series of virtual assistants,
    freelancers, and contractors. We’re all living in this more contract-based economy.
    It no longer makes sense to be the “company” man or woman.</p><p>Without the initiative
    and drive of an entrepreneur, you’ll get lost in the shuffle of a fast-paced world.</p><p>Ayodeji

  :title: How my friends and I grew our side project into a $17,000/month business
  :content: "<p>Photo courtesy of @ticurazvannarcis</p><p>In 2014, my friends and
    I set out to build the best possible web design tools. We built <a href=\"http://www.creative-tim.com/bootstrap-themes/ui-kit\">UI
    kits</a>, <a href=\"http://www.creative-tim.com/bootstrap-themes/admin-dashboard\">Admin
    Dashboards</a>, <a href=\"http://www.creative-tim.com/bootstrap-themes/free\">Templates</a>,
    and <a href=\"http://www.creative-tim.com/bootstrap-themes/components\">Plugins</a>.
    We’ve always tried to create products that are helpful in the development process,
    and that we ourselves would use for building websites for clients.</p><p>From
    a revenue’s perspective, if we don’t take into consideration the Black Friday
    sales (which doubled the amount that we made in November 2016), we are grossing
    around $22,000 per month. Part of that goes toward paying our affiliates’ commissions,
    collected VAT, payment vendors’ taxes, and other expenses. We end up netting around
    $17,000 each month.</p><p>In this case study, I’ll share exactly how we built
    our products and grew our business. You’ll hear all about:</p><ol><li><p>What
    motivated us to start our startup, <a href=\"https://www.creative-tim.com/\">Creative
    Tim</a>, and how we built our initial product</p></li><li><p>How we got our first
    users</p></li><li><p>Marketing strategies we used to grow</p></li><li><p>How our
    business model works</p></li><li><p>The story behind our revenue sources</p></li><li><p>Biggest
    lessons we’ve learned so far</p></li></ol><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2660/1*_RjJDWRpZ9i5lqcHKSZNOg.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><h2>1. What motivated us to get started with Creative Tim and how
    we built the initial product</h2><p>We started out as a two-person agency in Romania
    with no funding from third parties. We didn’t have enough cash to rent an office
    — even desks at a co-working space —so we just worked out of a Starbucks. We were
    barely able to pay our daily living expenses by doing work for clients.</p><p><a
    href=\"http://www.creative-tim.com\">Creative Tim</a> was a side project that
    we thought would come in handy to web developers like ourselves. We noticed that
    we were always “reinventing the wheel” when working with clients, and creating
    the same items over and over again for their websites. So we wanted to create
    a few standard components, like login and register modals, calendars, wizards,
    headers, and footers.</p><p>Over the span of a few months, we dedicated our time
    to implementing the platform and a few freebies (alongside the agency work). In
    the beginning, we didn’t have any Twitter followers, Facebook fans, or email list
    subscribers. We posted a lot of stuff about our freebies on various design forums
    and we used the “stalk web developers on Twitter” technique to spread the word
    about our products.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9326/1*VvFmMjuIahrRon1cv_nJjw.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><h2>2. How we got our first users</h2><p>At first, nobody really
    understood what we wanted to do. They didn’t understand the value we could provide
    by helping them improve their businesses. We decided that it would be better to
    create a more complex product that would help people understand what we were doing
    \U0001F914</p><p>We launched the <a href=\"http://demos.creative-tim.com/get-shit-done/index.html\">Get
    Shit Done Kit</a>, a UI Kit based on <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a>.
    It was featured <a href=\"https://www.designernews.co/stories/24249-get-shit-done-bootstrap3-ui-kit\">on
    Designer News</a>, and it was quite popular. We got over 11,000 users from that
    source, which was a huge spike for our business.</p><p>Then two weeks later our
    startup <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/creative-tim\">was featured
    on Product Hunt</a>. That gave us another spike with over 5,000 users. After that,
    the situation was stable, and we graduated from 0 users/week to a consistent 2,000
    to 3,000 users/week.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2378/0*XC3h5GMCtC89vOce.jpg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>A couple of months later, motivated by the success of free Get
    Shit Done Kit, we released <a href=\"http://gsdk.creative-tim.com\">Get Shit Done
    Kit PRO</a> the premium version of GSDK, with more components and ready-to-use
    example pages.</p><p>Initially, we only made a few sales. The product was generating
    about $200/week, which was not nearly enough to sustain our business. At the same
    time we were working on a web project for one of our clients.</p><p>Then in December,
    we got published on <a href=\"http://expo.getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap Expo</a>,
    the most popular gallery for showcasing websites created with Bootstrap. This
    was another important spike for our business. Since all of the people who go to
    Bootstrap Expo for inspiration already know Bootstrap or have previously worked
    with it, they were the perfect audience for our business.</p><p>Later, we discovered
    that getting traffic on your website is not enough to create a long term relationship
    with your users, and most of them forgot all about us after their first interaction.
    We did some research and discovered what most marketers probably already know:
    people forget things that they aren’t reminded of. Then we implemented the “Remember
    us email system” following the rules from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve\">forgetting
    curve</a>.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*-DWMkH6fqj1H3jTf28URLg.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>We wanted to give our users a reminder that we still existed and
    that we’re a valuable resource for their projects or their clients’ projects.</p><p>Currently,
    we send emails at the following schedule:</p><ol><li><p>After 3 days from their
    first download, we send an email with other recommended products.</p></li><li><p>On
    day 10 we send an email requesting feedback and asking if they need help.</p></li><li><p>On
    day 15 we remind them that they can upgrade to PRO.</p></li><li><p>On day 30 we
    ask them again for feedback and offer to promote something they’ve built in our
    gallery and social media.</p></li><li><p>We send a final reminder on day 60.</p></li></ol><h2>3.
    Marketing strategies we used to grow</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*1egR1OKd5dpJOGHHh_0VtA.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Most of our marketing strategies consisted of submitting our content
    to different communities like Reddit, Product Hunt, Designer News, Hacker News,
    and GitHub. Some important subreddits that work well in our area include <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design\">/r/web_design</a>,
    <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/html5\">/r/html5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/frontend\">/r/frontend</a>,
    and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev\">/r/webdev</a>.</p><p>We also paid
    between $100–200 for newsletter campaigns a couple of times. Even though the ROI
    ratio matched the amount we invested, the campaigns did not meet the expectations.
    (Maybe this was just in our case, that wasn’t profitable and it works better for
    others.)</p><p>Then we paid $400 for Get Shit Done Kit PRO to appear in the <a
    href=\"http://sidebar.io/\">Sidebar.io</a> newsletter, a curated list of the 5
    best design links made by <a href=\"undefined\">Sacha Greif</a>. This was a very
    rewarding newsletter for us, generating about $1,500 in sales.</p><p>Then we purchased
    the “Review + Newsletter” package ($550) from <a href=\"https://ewebdesign.com/giveaway-quality-bootstrap-components\">eWebDesign</a>.
    There were about 5,000 users who participated in the giveaway, and the total sales
    amounted $2,800.</p><p>We also thought about different places where we could find
    web developers who could use our products, and we realized that hackathons were
    exactly what we needed.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*A6EZiuYfY6n6ggnOdWQpnQ.jpeg\"
    alt=\"Presenting how our tools can help during the Hackathon\"><em>Presenting
    how our tools can help during the Hackathon</em></p><p>Subsequently we started
    talking to people that were organizing hackathons to offer them free licenses
    for our “premium products.” We sponsored over 20 hackathons in different cities
    around the world (you can check them <a href=\"http://www.creative-tim.com/sponsorships\">here</a>).</p><p>All
    the developers were happy to get free licenses, which made us happy that we could
    help them create better projects faster and they also found out who we are, so
    a win-win situation.</p><p>Critically, being physically present at some of the
    hackathons also gave us a lot of information about how the developers were using
    our products and how we could improve them in order to make them more user-friendly.</p><p>In
    March 2015, we finished the agency’s contracts and we switched from “<strong>Agency
    mode</strong>” to “<strong>Startup mode</strong>.”** **With some revenue in the
    bank and a few monthly sales, our team moved to working full time for our startup.
    As we put everything together and constantly launched new products, our sources
    of traffic and revenue grew.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3000/1*IfrU-yLcanueTYArD7VInQ.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><h2>4. How the business model works</h2><p>We realized that the best
    business model for Creative Tim was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium\">freemium</a>:
    we create high quality freebies that help web developers build great websites,
    then release the PRO versions for those freebies, which contain more elements,
    sections, plugins, and example pages.</p><p>At this moment, we have 8 premium
    products, each of which have their own freebies. Their prices range from $19 to
    $599, depending on the license and archive type (HTML, HTML + PSD, HTML + Sketch).
    The freebies appear everywhere on different communities, blog posts, newsletters,
    and social websites — and they are driving all of our traffic.</p><blockquote><h1><strong>Our
    business model</strong>: create high quality freebies that help web developers
    build great websites, then release the PRO versions for those freebies which contain
    more elements. \U0001F44C\U0001F3FC</h1></blockquote><p>The basic idea is that
    those freebies <em>are always</em> appearing on top 10 lists in these big communities.
    Each post that’s in the top 10 (depending on how big is the community) gives us
    between 1,000 and 15,000 targeted users in one day. You can imagine how much that
    would cost if you wanted to do a regular targeted marketing campaign. \U0001F62E</p><p>Some

    The story behind our revenue sources</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2188/1*hwAG3lazz-yLrz9dyY7hHQ.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><h3><strong>Direct Product Sales</strong></h3><p>Here we have the
    regular sales that are done on our website, which are worth about 24% of our overall
    sales. This doesn’t include the <a href=\"http://www.creative-tim.com/product/buy/bundle\">Big
    Bundle</a>.</p><p><strong>What is this Big Bundle, and how did we create it?</strong>
    We noticed that some of our users were downloading all our free products. (When
    I say all, I literally mean all of them in about 2–3 minutes after they have created
    an account.) We also noticed that some of our clients were purchasing all the
    products that were premium.</p><p>So we decided to test a new product called the
    “<strong>Big Bundle</strong>” which gives you access to all our products with
    huge discounts (over 60%). This big package was getting around 6–8 purchases per
    month. Since the prices for this Big Bundle is $299 (instead of $500) for the
    personal license and $669 (instead of $2,127) for the developer license, it’s
    a good source of revenue and a great deal for the web designers and agencies who
    are using our products for multiple clients. It’s a win-win situation.</p><h3><strong>Affiliates
    Sales</strong></h3><p>We’ve created an affiliate network, and our affiliates are
    very happy because they get 50% to themselves from each transaction. For example,
    one of our most important affiliations is done through a very popular GitHub Repo:

    alt=\"\"></p><h2>6. The biggest lessons we’ve learned so far</h2><h3><strong><em>It
    sounds cliché, but having a great product is crucial.</em></strong></h3><p>A lot
    of founders <em>really</em> struggle trying to market and sell something that
    people don’t want or don’t need. If your product is crap, there is no marketing
    strategy — and no source of investment — that can keep it alive for long.</p><p>At
    the moment, our products are used by over 134,000 web developers around the world.
    We have people from Microsoft, Ubisoft, Vodafone, Orange, Harvard University,
    Stanford University, and governmental institutions downloading and using them
    as different internal tools, and we’ve sponsored more than <a href=\"http://www.creative-tim.com/sponsorships\">20
    global hackathons</a> from 14 countries.</p><h3><strong><em>Don’t look to be the
    next Facebook. Try to solve a real problem instead.</em></strong></h3><p>Every
    step in our development seemed like the natural thing to do at the time. Looking
    back at our evolution, we wouldn’t change anything. But with all we’ve learned,
    we could definitely do everything faster the second time around.</p><p>We’ve always
    created and improved our products based on our customers’ feedback, and that is
    the best way to develop a business. It doesn’t matter what you personally like
    — you need to make sure you solve a real problem for a real customer.</p><h3><strong><em>Read,
    read, read.</em></strong></h3><p>In the past three years, I’ve read more than
    I’d read in my entire life, and this makes me feel great. Here are some of my
    favorite books, which I recommend to everybody:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Friends-Influence-People-Revised/dp/067142517X/\">How

    really do think that the secret weapon is to deliver great products combined with
    a great user experience and a great customer support.</h1></blockquote></li></ul><p>The
    best decision that we made was to put our customer in the first row, and make
    sure that they were receiving a great UI kit/Dashboard that really solved their
    problems. That guided us through the whole journey. Our secret weapon is that
    we deliver great products combined with a great user experience and great customer
    support.</p><h3><strong><em>Everything is possible</em></strong>.</h3><p>We are
    living in a world where anybody can become anything they want as long as they
    want to invest the amount of time that is needed. I’m saying time, and not money,
    because we all have time. I want to recommend two books that talk about this:
    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Karaoke-Capitalism-Management-22Financial-Financial/dp/0273687476\">Karaoke
    Capitalism by Jonas Ridderstråle and Kjell Nordstrom</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future-ebook/dp/B00J6YBOFQ\">Zero
    to One by Peter Thiel</a> (a PayPal co-founder).</p><p>At this point, there are
    no limits. You can go anywhere on the planet and you can talk with whomever you
    want just by contacting them through social media. Today an ordinary person can
    achieve more influence than the president of a small country. Think of those Instagram
    accounts with millions of followers. If I — a regular guy from Romania — can build
    a profitable business in 2.5 years that is making 60x my country’s monthly minimum
    monthly wage, then boy, just about anything is possible.</p><h2>Thanks for reading!

  :title: Designers shouldn’t code. They should study business.
  :content: "<p>Increasingly, more and more companies are looking for great design
    leadership these days. They are being told that their company needs a bigger focus
    on design thinking and are keen to adopt more design centric principles. But over
    and over, when these companies talk to designers, they hear about craftsmanship—about
    brand consistency, and polished design, designers who can code, and style guides,
    and prototyping, and testing — the designer’s craft.</p><p>All of those things
    are good — mandatory even. But for us to truly understand the best way to help
    a business we have to start focusing on what makes the business successful. We
    must first understand business in general. Then we will better understand where
    craft is important (and where it is excessive).</p><p>Instead, designers are often
    seen as someone that needs to have the important business goals explained to them
    in the most basic of ways. I think our suggestions about design would carry a
    lot more weight if we were able to have insightful conversations, and offer valuable
    suggestions about core business principles.</p><h3>Where we are now</h3><p>There
    are a lot of designers out there that are starting to think seriously about how
    their decisions impact their companies. In general, our focus on user research
    and analytics has helped a ton in giving more credence to the voices of designers.
    We’re also seeing great examples of design led companies and designers impacting
    the core of big businesses—like Airbnb, Pocket, Facebook, Google, Slack, and a
    loads of others.</p><p>I would argue that those companies are as successful as
    they are because they have designers that are focusing more on what those businesses
    need than on how perfect every pixel is going to look.</p><h3>Shifting our focus</h3><p>So
    how do we start thinking about design’s impact on business?</p><p>Maybe its going
    all out and getting an MBA. (All of the designers I know that have done this are
    actively contributing to the core of their business). But maybe it’s even more
    simple. Maybe its talking to the sales team to understand what the market looks
    like. Maybe it’s talking to shipping and fulfillment to understand why orders
    are always a day late. Maybe it’s reading over the Q1 projections and finding
    out that the key initiatives for the quarter have nothing to do with refactoring
    your CSS. Maybe it’s taking a night class in economics. Or maybe it’s just spending
    the night googling how fund raising and cap tables work instead of how to use
    the newest sketch plugin.</p><p>Maybe we should be spending our time learning
    about business principles — how to choose business models, how to manage teams,
    how to conduct competitive analysis, how to make projections, etc.</p><p>Maybe
    we should try to learn about the issues a CEO or VP faces and try to use design
    to help them solve their problems? Maybe we should try to figure out what keeps
    them up at night and help them solve their problems — instead of ours.</p><h3>The
    future</h3><p>I’m not saying we should start shipping poorly designed experiences.
    We have to keep growing and focusing on craft. If we don’t, nobody else will.
    But let’s also start understanding the businesses we work for and what they need
    in order to grow. If we’re able to do that, we will continue to gain more influence,
    and continue to create products that are more impactful—both for our companies
    and for the people that use them.</p>"

  :title: How Seth Godin Would Launch a New Business With $1,000 And 90 Days to Spare
  :content: "<p>When you treat people the way you’d like to be treated, cool things
    happen…</p><p>Most of the so-called marketing “influencers” out there are celebrities.</p><p>They’ve
    made it.</p><p>They’re not in the trenches anymore.</p><p>They forgot how to “do”
    marketing; their employees promote their new books for them, build their new websites,
    launch their new products… all they have to do is sign their name under whatever
    new projects and <em>Ka Ching!</em> the money starts rolling in their bank accounts.</p><p>That’s
    what I thought when I was preparing my interview with Seth Godin for my podcast
    called <a href=\"https://everyonehatesmarketers.com\">Everyone Hates Marketers</a>
    (how I managed to get him on the show is another story).</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*NCj6ETuB4huKlCmB.\"
    alt=\"Louis Grenier (left) and Seth Godin (right).\"><em>Louis Grenier (left)
    and Seth Godin (right).</em></p><p>Seth has published 18 books, is regarded as
    one the best marketing minds alongside Ogilvy or Tim Ferriss, so he doesn’t need
    to be in the trenches anymore.</p><p>I chose to challenge him to take him out
    of his comfort zone and see if he still “got it”.</p><p>I asked him to:</p><ul><li><p>come
    up with a business idea on the fly</p></li><li><p>explain EXACTLY how he would
    launch this new business,</p></li><li><p>describe how he would find his first
    customers,</p></li><li><p>Etc…</p></li></ul><p>There was one catch though: he
    couldn’t use his name to promote it, he had only a budget of $1,000, and 90 days
    to be successful.</p><p><strong>What follows is the exact 5-step process Seth
    Godin uses to launch a new business (from scratch) with only $1,000 in the bank
    and 90 days to spare.</strong></p><h2><strong>1) Market WITH people, not AT them</strong></h2><p><img

    alt=\"Step 1: Market with people, not at them.\"><em>Step 1: Market with people,
    not at them.</em></p><blockquote><h1>“<em>We, marketers, are selfish, lying, short-term
    thinking scum. We believe that our job is to manipulate people as we market to
    them.</em>” — Seth Godin</h1></blockquote><p>The time of scammy, in-your-face
    marketing is over.</p><p>20 years ago, you could come up with an average product,
    invest a few thousand euros in TV Ads saying that your product was the best ever,
    and sell 10,000 units of it.</p><p>Not anymore.</p><p><strong>People are immune
    to bad marketing.</strong></p><p>Don’t believe me?</p><p>When was the last time
    you bought SEO services from a cold email? When was the last time you subscribed
    to a new marketing software from an automated direct message on Twitter?</p><p>That’s
    right: never.</p><p>We expect to sell using those shady techniques, yet we HATE
    it when it happens to us.</p><p><strong>The first step towards a launching a new
    business according to Seth Godin is to change your mindset. You can’t come up
    with a product or service and THEN decide to market it.</strong></p><p>You have
    to involve people in the process.</p><p>Your customers are humans just like you.</p><p>They’re
    not just a number on Google Analytics.</p><p>Treat them as such.</p><h2><strong>2)
    Focus on the tiniest audience possible</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5000/1*sRsqg0EJnqdisVQY43Db-w.png\"

    of Patagonia.</em></p><p>In 1970, Yvon Chouinard (left), co-Founder of Patagonia,
    was selling “<em>homemade gear out of the back of his car, supplementing his income
    by diving into trash cans and redeeming bottles for cash</em>”.</p><p>Patagonia
    is now worth $209M.</p><p>I had the same dilemma when I started my podcast Everyone
    Hates Marketers. I wanted to reach ALL the marketers on the planet.</p><p>I realized
    that I would stretch myself too thin if I was going down this road.</p><p><strong>So
    I trimmed my audience to the bone: I would focus only on digital marketers working
    in tech who are sick of shady, aggressive marketing.</strong></p><p>This was the
    audience I knew the best: <strong>I am</strong> a tech marketer sick of shady,
    aggressive marketing.</p><p>By focusing on this small audience I have an edge
    over the generalist digital marketing podcasts out there.</p><p>I can address
    their biggest, most specific pains. This is what remarkable marketing is all about.</p><p>This
    probably goes against everything you learned about business. That’s because this
    is the ugly, <em>un</em>sexy part.</p><p>No, you’re not going to become a millionaire
    this year, or even next year. It might take 9 years, 18 years, 25 years, who knows?</p><p><strong>So,
    how do you pick a tiny audience?</strong></p><p>This part takes discipline.</p><p>You
    probably have an idea of a product or service you want to offer; now it’s time
    to select the bullseye: who are the people who will benefit the most from using
    your product or service?</p><p>When I asked Seth Godin to come up with a business
    idea on the fly, he came up with a concierge service to help tourists find an
    Airbnb in Paris.</p><p>But “tourists” could be anybody: are we serving a Japanese
    family looking to go to Versailles for the first time or a Brazilian businessman
    who want a place to stay near Bercy for a seminar?</p><p>So, Seth trimmed down
    his audience: he would help Californian families with young kids to find the best
    place to stay in Paris for their holidays.</p><p>This is much more specific, and,
    all of a sudden, the problems they face and the solutions we can offer become
    much more specific, too.</p><p>Californian families want high-speed internet to
    talk with their relatives who stayed in San Diego. They want to see the Eiffel
    Tower from their balcony just like in the movies. They want to taste the best
    croissants Paris has to offer since they can’t find any in San Diego.</p><p>See
    what I mean?</p><p>You might fear that the audience you’re thinking of is too
    small.</p><p>Here’s a tip I got from <a href=\"https://everyonehatesmarketers.com/positioning-makes-marketing-10x-better/\">Philip
    Morgan</a> (an expert in marketing positioning): if there’s a conference especially
    organized for it, then your audience is big enough.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*5eBo87UBjRzjVt-1LZta6Q.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>For example, did you know that there’s a <a href=\"https://www.soapguild.org/conference/index.php\">conference
    for handcrafted soap makers</a>?</p><p>The next one is in Atlanta, Georgia, and
    450 attendees are expected. If the handcrafted soap maker conference organizers
    managed to make money from such a tiny audience, so can you!</p><h2><strong>3)
    Create a remarkable product</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5000/1*Og70eETpvoomcYqj13rMCw.png\"
    alt=\"Step 3: Create a remarkable product.\"><em>Step 3: Create a remarkable product.</em></p><p>Ok,
    ok, this might sound cliché but hear me out first.</p><p><strong>Remarkable marketing
    starts with a remarkable product.</strong></p><p>But, what’s a remarkable product
    you ask?</p><p>It’s a product that your customers simply CAN’T live without; they
    love it so much that they tell their friends, who tell their friends, who tell
    their friends.</p><p>You get the drill.</p><p>The problem is that most of us try
    to sell average products to average people.</p><p>Because the products are average,
    customers are not raving about them.</p><p>They don’t talk about them to their
    friends.</p><p>As a consequence, we have to use shady, aggressive marketing to
    compensate for the loss in business.</p><p>Do you think Slack had to use in-your-face
    marketing to sell their product?</p><p>Nope.</p><p>Anybody can use their product
    for free — there is no string attached. The product is so good that it IS their
    marketing. They went from 16,000 Daily Active Users to 2.7 Million in 2 years.</p><p>As
    <a href=\"https://everyonehatesmarketers.com/seth-godin-marketing-secrets/\">Seth
    Godin</a> mentioned in the episode: did you start using Facebook because you saw
    their ads on a lifestyle magazine? Nope. Your friends told you about it.</p><p>Have
    you heard of MailChimp because they sponsored a conference you went to?</p><p>Nope.</p><p>Their
    email tool was so good that you started to receive newsletters from businesses
    and people you knew, sent from MailChimp. You checked out their site, tried their
    email software for free, and loved the experience.</p><p>Now here’s the hard truth:
    you’re <em>not</em> going to launch the next Facebook, MailChimp, or Slack.</p><p>They’re
    solving big problems for millions of people.</p><p>But, to start with, you can
    create a remarkable product for a small audience.</p><p>It’s time to get out of
    the building and talk to people:</p><ul><li><p>Identify one of their most painful,
    unsolved problems</p></li><li><p>Work your ass off to help them solve it</p></li><li><p>Give
    a sample of your product or service for free</p></li><li><p>Do they rave about
    it and offer to share it with their friends straight away? You have a winner.</p></li><li><p>If
    not, collect their feedback and start again.</p></li></ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3050/1*myzOr2C_jNVKQ1xlyq_zTQ.png\"
    alt=\"The Hotjar Beta in Numbers.\"><em>The Hotjar Beta in Numbers.</em></p><p>This
    is why <a href=\"https://www.hotjar.com\">Hotjar</a>, the all-in-one analytics
    and feedback solution for your website, wanted to build a remarkable product.</p><p>It
    took them only 4 weeks to come up with the first version of the product, built
    a very simple landing page, let 1,500 people use it straight away, and gathered
    feedback.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.hotjar.com/blog/2016/01/12/the-hotjar-story-part-1-from-idea-to-60000-beta-signups-in-6-months/\">The
    product was so good that those 1,500 early adopters referred an additional 17,500
    people in less than a month</a>. At this point, the Hotjar co-founders knew they
    had a winner.</p><p>There is no silver bullet in building a remarkable product
    and it might take you months or even years to find the right recipe, but, if you
    start with a small audience and gather feedback on the way, your chance of coming
    up with a remarkable product or service will get much, much, higher.</p><h2><strong>4)
    Create an abundance of confidence</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5000/1*5P-vd3y4-TGH7_t2kdVdeA.png\"
    alt=\"Step 4: Create an abundance of confidence.\"><em>Step 4: Create an abundance
    of confidence.</em></p><p><strong>How do you get the word out about your product
    or service if you have only $1,000 in the bank?</strong></p><blockquote><h1>In
    the words of Seth Godin, “<em>by giving people an abundance of confidence which
    will create an abundance of value and all I’m asking in return is to be trusted.</em>”</h1></blockquote><p>Let’s
    get back to the example mentioned earlier: a concierge service for Californian
    families who want to get to Paris on holidays and find a place to stay.</p><p>To
    get the word out, Seth proposes to select the best 50 Airbnbs in Paris, take pictures,
    and create an amazing 50-page guide of where our potential customers should stay
    when going to Paris.</p><p>This guide would be available for free, on Medium,
    for everybody to see.</p><p>He would then contact 10 people he knows who fit the
    description of his ideal audience and see if they get any value out of it.</p><p>If
    they do, they’re probably going to share this guide to their friends, who will
    then share it with their friends and so on…</p><p>If they don’t, he would improve
    the guide until they do.</p><p>Here’s the catch: he would leave his email address
    at the bottom of the guide, and expect readers to contact with questions.</p><p>He’d
    give great free advice, engaging with 100 to 1000 people a day back and forth,
    back and forth, until he’d the indispensable middle man.</p><p>Airbnb owners would
    pay him to write a review about their place, while American families will reach
    out to find the best Airbnb apartment in the city center of Paris for less than
    250$ a night.</p><p>This concept can be applied to any type of products to services:
    to be trusted you must first give value for free.</p><p>This requires patience.</p><p>At
    the end of 2016, Unbounce, a landing page software, had more than 16,000 paying
    customers.</p><p>How did they get there?</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3572/1*OJw8CpEhP6t18xc16lOByg.png\"

    you could do, so many channels you could use, so many ideas running in your head.</p><p>How
    do you choose which project to focus on first?</p><p>Simple.</p><blockquote><h1>Just
    pick one, or as Seth Godin would say: “Make a spinner and spin the wheel”.</h1></blockquote><p>Do
    a thing and stick to it.</p><p>I used to act like a headless chicken when I started
    my career: I was impatient, switching from one project to another in a blink of
    an eye.</p><p>7 years ago, I launched a blog about marketing (in French), wrote
    9 articles, and stopped because there weren’t enough people reading them.</p><p>4
    years ago, I wanted to create a community for cystic fibrosis patients to connect
    with each other (my younger brother has cystic fibrosis). I pitched the idea at
    a Startup Weekend, worked on it for two weeks, and quit.</p><p>It is when I started
    interviewing no-nonsense marketers a few months that I had an epiphany: every
    one of my guests, in their own words, mentioned the virtue of tranquility.</p><blockquote><h1>In
    stoicism, tranquility is defined by: “<em>believing in yourself and trusting that
    you are on the right path, and not being in doubt by following myriad footpaths
    of those wandering in every direction</em>”.</h1></blockquote><p>I stopped checking
    my mentions on Twitter every 30 minutes, I stopped checking my website stats on
    Google Analytics every day, I stopped looking at my podcast downloads every Tuesday
    (when I publish a new episode on Everyone Hates Marketers).</p><p>Instead, I’ve
    decided to make a spinner and spin the wheel. I’ve decided to deliver value every
    week and to stop expecting success to knock on my door tomorrow.</p><p>I <em>know</em>
    that success will come; I just don’t know when.</p><p>It’s such a liberating feeling.</p><p><strong>Success
    is a byproduct of helping people solve their biggest most painful problems.</strong></p><p><img

    credit</a></em></p><blockquote><h1><em>Crowds consume information. Those who decide
    what crowds consume create.</em></h1><h1><em>You might as well carry on with the
    bottomless finger-scrolling and continue to devour what the elite class has created
    for you today.</em></h1><h1><em>But if you ever intend to define what crowds consume,
    and thereby define the marketplace, you have to master the ability to stay away
    from the crowds and move over to the creators’ side.</em></h1><h1><em>That’s where
    the elite production happens. And it requires long, uninterrupted hours of work
    in intense concentration.</em></h1></blockquote><p>I wrote down the above notes
    in my journal in 2016. It was soon after being hugely inspired by Adam Grant’s
    story, which I had read in Cal Newport’s popular book, Deep Work.</p><p>In 2014,
    Adam Grant’s ability to create at an absurdly high rate for his field made him
    <a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/deep-work-the-secret-to-achieving-peak-productivity/">the
    youngest full professor</a> at Wharton. It wasn’t only starring at one of the
    world’s best business schools nor the unusually high number of papers he was publishing
    in major journals, but also his ability to write one massive bestselling book
    after another.</p><p>As Cal Newport later found out, none of those achievements
    were random: Grant was indeed obsessed with the mechanics of producing at an elite
    level — a level where you produce not only quality work but also deliver it at
    a wildly high pace.</p><p>He saw productivity as a scientific problem to systematically
    solve. And one idea seemed central to his solution:</p><blockquote><h1>The batching
    of hard but important intellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches.</h1></blockquote><p>According
    to Newport, those stretches enabled Grant to achieve a deep state of focus like
    no other — working for extended periods free from distraction with full concentration
    on a single task unlocked peak productivity.</p><p>Back in those days, I couldn’t
    even sit still on my chair for a few minutes, never mind keeping my attention
    long enough to get my monkey mind to focus on a single task. As I mentioned in
    <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-truth-about-blogging-f7ada34e6121">a 2015
    essay</a>, I wasn’t doing <em>the thing</em>, but I did everything else in order
    to postpone doing <em>the thing</em>.</p><p>Between bottomless Instagram scrolling
    and trying to do at least some work here and there, I was spending my entire days
    staring at a screen. Yet when I got home in the evening, I felt exhausted and
    nervous. And guilty. Guilty of not having achieved anything.</p><p>Punishing myself
    with more work or promising to make a fresh start the next morning didn’t work.
    New beginnings weren’t any different — they required concentration, too. That’s
    when my brain chose to run for the next exit. Hopping on to the next stimulus
    it bumped into felt good. Facing the actual work meant mental effort instead.</p><p>French
    mathematician Blaise Pascal was right:</p><blockquote><h1><em>All of humanity’s
    problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.</em></h1></blockquote><p>But
    success in most creative endeavors requires the exact opposite: to sit and think.
    Take the field of writing. To write is to think. To write well is to think well.</p><p>And
    the trouble with our monkey minds begins right there, in our inability to sit
    alone with our thoughts.</p><p>We can’t stay away from those who consume because
    we can’t tolerate boredom.</p><p>We dread the silence of our very existence so
    we choose aimless distraction.</p><p>In author Zat Rana’s <a href="https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-most-important-skill-nobody-taught-you-9b162377ab77">beautiful
    words</a>, the issue at the root isn’t our obsession with any particular worldly
    stimulation. It’s the fear of nothingness — our addiction to a state of not-being-bored:</p><blockquote><h1><em>“At
    its core, it’s not necessarily that we are addicted to a TV set because there
    is something uniquely satisfying about it, just like we are not addicted to most
    stimulants because the benefits outweigh the downsides.</em></h1><h1><em>Rather,
    what we are really addicted to is a state of not-being-bored. Almost anything
    else that controls our life in an unhealthy way finds its root in our realization
    that we dread the nothingness of nothing.</em></h1><h1><em>We can’t imagine just
    being rather than doing. And therefore, we look for entertainment, we seek company,
    and if those fail, we chase even higher highs.”</em></h1></blockquote><p>Coming
    to such a realization can be life-changing. For me, identifying the root of my
    attention problem marked one of the most crucial turning points in my journey.</p><p><em>If
    I can teach myself to choose boredom over aimless distraction,</em> I thought
    to myself, <em>I can fix my attention problem.</em></p><p>If I wanted to work
    for extended periods with full concentration on a single task, I had to learn
    a new skill:</p><blockquote><h1>The ability to sit alone with my thoughts and
    bear the unbearable boredom it brings.</h1></blockquote><p>What I didn’t know,
    however, was how much effort it would take.</p><h2>If you can change your mind,
    you can change your life.</h2><p>On October 12th last month, I recorded one of
    my longest sessions in full concentration. I started working at 8:10 a.m. and
    finished my morning flow at 12:57 p.m.</p><p>That was 4 hours 47 minutes of effortless,
    uninterrupted deep work without needing to take a single break.</p><p>During this
    morning session, I wrote <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/if-you-learn-to-write-you-can-change-your-life-d0df747e02c8">one</a>
    of my most popular articles. I was also able to approve two client deliverables
    our editors had asked me to review.</p><p>Over the last few years, the length
    of those focused stretches has been slowly going up; these days, they’re averaging
    around four hours.</p><p>Timing my focused sessions isn’t to show off or fool
    myself with a vanity metric, nor is it to adapt yet another Silicon Valley productivity
    trend. But it is part of a system I have learned to follow religiously since 2016.</p><p>And
    if you can forgive me for the use of too many self-important “I”s or “my”s in
    this essay, I want to share my *system *with you — a system that gradually took
    me from not being able to sit still on my chair for even 15 minutes to effortlessly
    working in hours-long, deeply focused stretches.</p><p>I run a storytelling studio
    and a publication where my work requires me to mentally process large amounts
    of text on a daily basis.</p><p>And the batching of work into long, uninterrupted
    stretches has been a gamechanger for delivering high-quality intellectual work
    and signing some of today’s top startups as clients in an overly crowded content
    industry.</p><h2>A quick note before we begin</h2><p>Reading this post or self-help
    books may feel useful. But before turning everything into inspiration porn, it’s
    crucial to understand why you are reading this essay in the first place.</p><p>This
    mini-guide is a 14-minute read. You’ve completed reading the first four minutes
    so far. Finishing the rest in one sitting will be <em>effortless</em> for some
    of you. But others won’t even get close to staying focused enough to continue
    reading for the next 10 minutes. To do that, they will need to <em>force</em>
    themselves to not open another browser tab or grab their mobile phones.</p><p>Understanding
    the fundamentals of uninterrupted work requires understanding that very exact
    <strong><em>effortless focus</em></strong> which sits on the thin line between
    <strong><em>loose focus</em></strong> (one that risks losing it to distractions
    at any second) and <strong><em>forced focus</em></strong> (one that eats up your
    limited mental stock).</p><p>The effortless focus is the sweet spot. It’s the
    ultimate mental balance we are looking to reach by mastering our minds.</p><p>And
    this guide proposes a pragmatic approach to achieve just that — it advocates the
    idea that the mind is a tool whose muscles can be trained. Drawing upon my 47
    months of experience and other examples, it shares a roadmap for how to get your
    mind to work for you, not against you.</p><p>Please note that what works for others
    might not work for you, so try taking away only what applies to your case.</p><p>The
    rest of the post consists of two sections. While the first section below focuses
    on the practicalities of mind training and strengthening the attention muscles,
    the second part will dig into the specifics of logging long, uninterrupted sessions
    of focused work.</p><h2>1. Taming the monkey mind</h2><p>I’ve written 1,345 words
    up to this point. I got stuck on one of the paragraphs you just read above so
    I had to take a quick break to walk out on the terrace. But other than that, I’ve
    been in an uninterrupted flow for about 187 minutes since 7:50 a.m.</p><p>It still
    amazes me to see how on earth I am able to stay focused for so many hours without
    being bored. And every time I watch people who can’t even walk without staring
    at their phones, I remember my old monkey-mind days.</p><p>I owe this dramatic
    transition to the one and only <strong>daily mind-training practice</strong>.</p><p>Whatever
    controls your attention <a href="https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d">controls</a>
    what you are capable of. And taming your brain puts that control back in your
    hands. Borrowing philosopher <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/120416-the-greatest-weapon-against-stress-is-our-ability-to-choose">William
    James’s words</a>, it empowers you with today’s greatest weapon: the ability to
    choose one thought over another.</p><p>And building an ability to choose boredom
    over aimless distraction begins with awareness — awareness of our inability to
    sit alone with our thoughts.</p><p>But awareness doesn’t last — you have to work
    at it. You need to train your brain, whether every day or every week, to catch
    yourself every time your monkey mind drifts off and becomes a slave to the aimless
    stimuli.</p><p>You need a consistent practice to bring your wandering mind back
    to the task at hand — to the boredom.</p><p>And if you stick with your practice
    long enough, the whole catch-and-bring-back process becomes <em>effortless</em>.</p><p>Before
    we talk about how and what tools you can use to tame your mind, let’s take a quick
    look at the purpose behind it all.</p><h2>1.1. What is the ultimate purpose?</h2><p>Terms
    like “mind training,” “self-reflection practice,” or “mindfulness” can easily
    sound philosophical or vague. And it’s important to understand that what we are
    talking about here isn’t a mystical activity.</p><p>What matters instead is understanding
    the true purpose behind it all — which is all about <strong>spending time undistracted
    and alone, in self-examination.</strong></p><p>In very simple words, it’s about:</p><ol><li><p>setting
    aside some time for self-reflection on a regular basis — I recommend starting
    <em>daily</em>;</p></li><li><p>during this, say, 10-minute session, observing
    the thoughts, emotions, sensations, or sounds in your mind, body, and surroundings;</p></li><li><p>learning
    to let everything you observe just be — so no forcing or trying to change anything;
    and</p></li><li><p>sticking with this practice long enough.</p></li></ol><p>How
    you do one thing in life is how you do everything. Over time, you automatically
    start bringing such self-reflection into your day-to-day life. You start catching
    and observing yourself outside your 10-minute daily practice.</p><p>For instance,
    if you are distracted by a loud person in the office, you notice it, label it
    as “just noise” and return back to your focused work without getting caught up
    in it.</p><p>In my case, my job often involves staring at a blank page. And staring
    at a blank page requires embracing the unbearable nothingness of that screen.
    After 41 months of <em>daily meditation</em> (more on that in a minute), I’m able
    to catch myself almost every time my monkey mind drifts off and bring it back
    to the boring empty screen in front of me.</p><p>What has impressed me the most
    with my daily practice is how, over time, it has also drastically reduced the
    number of times my mind drifts off.</p><h2>1.2. How can I actually train my mind?</h2><p>You
    don’t need any fancy tools to get great results. All you need is to make time
    regularly, whether every day or every week, undistracted and alone, in self-reflection
    mode.</p><p>A pen and paper will do it. Some people follow a daily journaling
    practice, while others prefer retreats, walks in nature or other self-reflection
    methods.</p><p>What worked best for me has been <em>meditation</em> — what I once
    thought was a mystical activity has changed my life forever.</p><p>Today, there
    are hundreds of meditation apps on the app stores. Calm and Headspace are popular.
    For instance, Calm’s 30-day “How to Mediate” program with Jeff Warren is impressive.
    I first began with the “7 Days of Calm” program and then moved on to the “21 Days
    of Calm” — both are great for beginners and cover all the fundamentals.</p><p>But
    again, Headspace and all other apps offer similar programs so I recommend trying
    some and seeing what works best for you.</p><p>One of the reasons those meditation
    apps are so powerful is because they are guided. Run by capable instructors, those
    10-minute sessions make you realize things that would take you months to acknowledge
    in a self-taught session.</p><h2>1.3. How long does it take to see any progress?</h2><p>Training
    the attention muscles is a long game — reaching a level where you naturally catch
    your distractions outside your 10-minute sessions takes some time.</p><p>But to
    give some examples from my personal experience, I began meditating daily in July
    2016. It took me around two months just to get comfortable with sitting down alone
    with my thoughts.</p><p>In the early days, it was shocking to see how my mind
    was able to wander off so often during the sessions, never mind applying it to
    my day-to-day life.</p><p>But as I kept taking it seriously and making time to
    sit down with my practice, between three to six months, I began understanding
    what those instructors meant — that boredom really did provide its own stimulation;
    that I didn’t need another stimulus and could just sit and get curious about the
    present moment.</p><p>These days, I don’t even need to open my meditation app
    as I can practice self-reflection right at my desk or during my commute to work.</p><p>I
    still have hectic days where my mind is completely on fire and I fail at being
    mindful. But the goal isn’t to get lost in the rabbit hole of personal development,
    nor are we trying to become productivity gurus — welcoming a hectic day without
    any judgment is part of the practice itself.</p><p>Indeed, over time, you understand
    that there is no goal at all and this is a lifelong journey to learning to focus
    on the only thing that matters: the present moment.</p><p>And not surprisingly,
    the present moment is also where you have to do the focused work — it’s where
    the blank page stands in front of you.</p><h2>2. Tracking and improving your ability
    to focus for longer sessions</h2><p>While the mind-taming practice does its magic
    in the background, you can start tracking your progress from day one.</p><p>This
    tracking involves writing down each uninterrupted session you are able to work
    in full concentration.</p><p>Mark down when you start, and when you finish. The
    goal is to gradually improve your ability to record longer, deeper sessions.</p><p>Here’s
    what my daily tracking looks like:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/8064/1*v-XKE-DJZgSI4B1Ke6kVdg.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>Every time I need to take a quick break or feel my concentration
    is getting loose, I close the session and write down the final minute where my
    session ends.</p><p>I recommend not setting ambitious goals at the beginning —
    in the early weeks, my sessions used to average around only 20–30 minutes.</p><p>The
    routine of logging my sessions helps me to track the progress of what I love to
    call a “myelin-building exercise.” When the journalist Daniel Coyle surveyed a
    group of neuroscientists for his book <a href="http://danielcoyle.com/the-talent-code/">The
    Talent Code</a>, he had little idea what he was about to uncover.</p><p>These
    scientists argued that people’s performance at hard tasks improved as they developed
    more <em>myelin</em> (a layer of fatty tissue) around the relevant neurons, allowing
    the corresponding circuit to fire more <em>effortlessly</em> and effectively.</p><p>As
    Cal Newport <a href="https://books.google.nl/books?id=B_L8CAAAQBAJ&pg=PT34&lpg=PT34&dq=cal+newport+deep+work+neural+circuit+fire+fast&source=bl&ots=LmR7I3CrMB&sig=ACfU3U0THy0oYg7HJjG_KX8nVroXp6fGOA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2veaxzrTlAhWGY1AKHdlKCp0Q6AEwBHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=cal%20newport%20deep%20work%20neural%20circuit%20fire%20fast&f=false">also
    reflected</a> on Coyle’s findings, to be great at intense concentration was to
    be well <em>myelinated</em>:</p><blockquote><h1><em>“By focusing intensely on
    a specific skill, you’re forcing the relevant circuit to fire, again and again,
    in isolation. This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells called
    oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the
    circuits.</em></h1><h1><em>The reason, therefore, why it’s important to focus
    intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the
    only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination.”</em></h1></blockquote><p>By
    contrast, if you work in a state of <em>loose concentration</em> (e.g., you have
    another tab open), you fire too many circuits simultaneously and as a result fail
    at isolating the neurons you actually want to strengthen.</p><p>Whether the myelin
    science has any actual merit to it, it’s still impressive to see how the mind
    adapts and gets better at logging longer sessions over time.</p><p>And after two
    years of tracking my sessions, I’ve found that faster progress depends heavily
    on two things: 1) protecting your time, and 2) decluttering your system.</p><p>Let’s
    finish this guide by taking a quick look at both:</p><h2>2.1. Protecting your
    time: enter “untouchable hours”</h2><p>With <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/warren-buffett/#52fd45304639">over
    $87 billion</a> to his name, there is one thing Warren Buffett can’t purchase:
    time.</p><p>“I can buy anything I want, basically, but I can’t buy time,” shares
    the 88-year-old billionaire <a href="https://charlierose.com/videos/29774">in
    a 2017 conversation</a> with Bill Gates.</p><p>Time is really <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/whats-an-hour/">the
    most precious thing</a> there is. Yet we split it up and give it away like there’s
    an endless supply.</p><p>Probably the most impactful thing I’ve done that has
    improved my ability to log deeper sessions was to introduce <strong><em>untouchable
    hours</em></strong> to my work system.</p><p>These are the hours where I protect
    my most precious asset; the hours where even the closest people in my life have
    a hard time reaching me. It’s when even my phone can’t get past the door of the
    room I’m working in — the rest of the world can wait.</p><blockquote><h1><em>“Focus
    isn’t a willpower effort one does in the midst of distractions; it’s the act of
    removing distractions and effortlessly doing what’s left.” — <a href="https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca/status/898941093210992640">Luca
    Dellanna</a></em></h1></blockquote><p>As the name suggests, these are your untouchable
    hours. You need to guard them. Hoard them. Protect them. And don’t let any potential
    distraction touch them.</p><h2>To find your untouchable hours, find your prime
    time</h2><p>Whether you’re a morning person or a night owl, everyone has different
    peak hours.</p><p>I highly recommend finding your internal prime time, <a href="https://www.briantracy.com/blog/time-management/6-time-management-tips-to-increase-productivity-organizational-skills/">which
    is</a> the time of day, according to your body clock, when you are most alert
    and productive.</p><p>My prime time is from 7 a.m. to around 12:30 p.m. I figured
    out that my energy drops significantly in the second part of the day so I get
    my deep work done before lunchtime. And I handle all the other teamwork, operational
    or admin stuff in the afternoons.</p><p>You don’t always have the luxury to choose,
    though. Some people have day jobs and their untouchable hours for their side projects
    happen in the early morning before everyone else wakes up. Others have kids and
    can lock down untouchable time for themselves only after the little ones go to
    bed.</p><h2>2.2. Decluttering your system</h2><blockquote><h1><em>“A busy calendar
    and a busy mind will destroy your ability to create anything great. You should
    be too busy to do coffee while keeping an uncluttered calendar.”</em></h1><h1><em>—
    <a href="https://twitter.com/naval">Naval Ravikant</a></em></h1></blockquote><p>Setting
    aside untouchable hours doesn’t mean you should flood the rest of your day with
    things to do.</p><p>To log longer, deeper sessions, you’ll also need to use your
    energy wisely outside your untouchable hours. You’ll need a calm mind and a calendar
    that’s as empty as possible.</p><p>When the host Charlie Rose <a href="https://charlierose.com/videos/29774">asks</a>
    Bill Gates what he has learned from Warren Buffett, Gates points to Buffett’s
    almost entirely empty calendar. “There’s nothing on it,” he says.</p><p>And reflecting
    on how Buffett taught him to declutter his agenda, he adds: “You know, I had every
    minute packed and I thought that was the only way you could do things.”</p><p>One
    of the things I’ve learned on this front is that the best way to get things done
    is to have fewer things to do. And having fewer things to do has a lot to do with
    your ability to say NO.</p><p>Taking time away from a busy to-do list gives you
    all the time and energy to sit and think.</p><h2>Final words: It’s time we learn
    to sit alone with our thoughts</h2><p>You might as well carry on with the bottomless
    finger-scrolling and continue to consume what the elite class has created for
    you today. Or you might choose to stay away from the crowds and move over to the
    creators’ side.</p><p>Observing the elite class’s obsession with producing at
    an elite level is a wake-up call for all of us to finally get serious about learning
    to sit alone with our thoughts.</p><p>Whatever controls our attention controls
    what we are capable of. And taking that control back in our hands begins by training
    our brains to embrace the boredom that comes with hours-long work in full concentration.</p><p>Choosing
    boredom over aimless stimuli is choosing the silence of our very existence. After
    all, we learn from the silences, not from what makes the most noise on the surface.</p><p>Once
    we cross that initial barrier, we realize boredom really does provide its own
    stimuli. We begin getting curious about the present moment.</p><p>And not surprisingly,
    the present is also where we have to do the focused work — it’s where the blank
    page stands in front of us.</p><p>Welcome to the creators’ club.</p><pre><code>Thank

  :title: 'Running a business with boobs: the things I never say'
  :content: '<p>I’ve never published anything about what it’s like to be a woman in
    business, but today is International Women’s Day and I decided to use my incredibly
    keen wit and personal experiences to speak some truths ;)</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*quWPuU5Kf0OBWFRCYctgiw.jpeg"
    alt="Credit: Life Magazine (From photo shoot of the Monokini designed by Rudy
    Gernreich)"><em>Credit: Life Magazine (From photo shoot of the Monokini designed
    by Rudy Gernreich)</em></p><p>I have boobs. They are small boobs but they are
    still boobs. I also run a business. It’s bigger and more important to me than
    my boobs. These are just facts, but I’m sure I’ve already offended someone… so
    let’s just keep this rolling.</p><p>I started my first business at 16 and have
    been a CEO with employees for the past seven years of my life. I’m 29 now. I started
    out life as a baby and then a little girl in Detroit and now I live in LA and
    run <a href="http://lumi.com">Lumi</a>. Yep, these facts make me a Female CEO.
    Similarly, a person who starts life out as a baby that turns into a little boy
    who then devotes the better part of a decade to building businesses might end
    up as a Male CEO.</p><p>For anyone in the business community who interacts with
    people with boobs (cough, cough, 100% of the business community), these are five
    things I’ve never said about the things you shouldn’t say either. All of them
    are from personal experience.</p><h2>1. Don’t invite me to your event and admit
    it’s because you want women there.</h2><p>I fully understand and support efforts
    to make business events more diverse and inclusive, but inviting me to an event
    and in the same breath admitting that you’re doing it because you want women to
    be there is sort of like inviting a black guy to your birthday party and admitting
    it’s because you don’t want your other friends to think you’re racist. It feels
    icky and makes the invitee feel like the invitation isn’t genuine.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3000/1*MLrmYq3BVMBXVKx5Ybv-4w.jpeg" alt="This
    is me, holding a box."><em>This is me, holding a box.</em></p><h2>2. Don’t ask
    me if my dad helped me draft a document.</h2><p>Yes, someone asked me this about
    a contract I sent them. This is just one example of the blatant questions and
    comments older men wittingly or unwittingly ask young females in business without
    understanding the gravity of the sexism involved. Would you ask a mid-20s self-made
    male businessperson if their father helped them with something?</p><p>Yes, my
    dad was a lawyer, but he is also dead. The last document he helped me draft was
    a middle school English paper.</p><h2>3. Don’t demean me while asking for a job.</h2><p>In
    the past three months I’ve interviewed over 60 candidates for sales, operations
    and financial roles as I work to build out my team at Lumi. The frequency that
    male job candidates ask demeaning questions is fascinating, and always shocking.</p><p>Here’s
    an example: while interviewing a man for a comptroller position, he asked me if
    I was familiar with financial statements, like a balance sheet. This person knew
    I had been an entrepreneur for years. When I simply replied y<em>es</em>, because
    I found the question so mystifying, I was met with laughter and a five minute
    lecture on why balance sheets matter. A lecture that would have been more fitting
    for a high school level finance class than an interview with a CEO who carved
    out a precious 30 minute slot to speak with a candidate.</p><p>Assume women know
    things. Provide real intelligence and value when you speak with them, or get out
    of the way so they can find a different colleague.</p><h2>4. Don’t act surprised
    that I am the CEO.</h2><p>I’m a five foot tall woman weighing in at about 118
    pounds. Even though I spell my name <em>Jesse</em>, the male spelling, most people
    I meet use the internet and already know I am a female. Other people learn about
    Lumi just by experiencing our company or products online and then find out that
    I am the CEO. It’s often those people who react with some expression of shock,
    like, “Whoa! Lumi is actually a really cool company. You’re the CEO?” <em>Actually</em>,
    I really am.</p><p>Another cringeworthy reaction I get is surprise, if not skepticism,
    that I’m not in an female-focused industry. Female CEOs are making extraordinary
    progress with female-specific products in industries that were all but totally
    neglected, but just like with male founders, we have the capacity to focus on
    passions beyond our anatomy.</p><p>Both of these expressions of surprise suck.
    I can run any type of company I want. I could start a company around male mental
    health if I wanted to, and the more comments I get like this, the more I consider
    it.</p><h2>5. Don’t question my level of ambition.</h2><p>If I told you about
    a sub 30-year-old guy who raised over $270k on Kickstarter during college, personally
    sold a product they invented into 1,500 retail stores, built a company into seven
    figure sales without venture investment, turned down a deal on <em>Shark Tank</em>,
    got into Y Combinator, raised venture capital from top tier investors, and has
    been an active CEO without a single break or sabbatical for seven years, would
    you question their level of ambition?</p><p>Nope. So don’t question mine.</p><p>I’ve
    seen dudes being hailed as ambitious simply for quitting their cushy day jobs,
    yet it’s surprisingly common for women to be questioned on whether they are ambitious
    “enough.” Stop questioning the ambition level of women in business.</p><h3>Having
    boobs and running a business is exactly the same as having a penis and running
    a business, except boobs are more aesthetically pleasing. I hope, at minimum,
    we can all agree on that.</h3><p>Added Note: For anyone concerned about penis-shaming
    please note that I think penises are great (I favor those attached to people I
    already like). For anyone concerned that this neglects trans individuals, please
    note how I used language around the baby portion up top to allude to the fact
    that a baby might choose to be whatever gender it identifies with.</p><p>I respect
    penises and trans folk. I also respect my own sense of humor enough not to make
    rash edits to this article, which I hope you can respect.</p>'

  :title: Why businesses fail at machine learning
  :content: '<p>I’d like to let you in on a secret: when people say ‘machine learning’
    it sounds like there’s only one discipline here. There are two, and if businesses
    don’t understand the difference, they can experience a world of trouble.</p><h3>A
    tale of two machine learnings</h3><p>Imagine hiring a chef to build you an oven
    or an electrical engineer to bake bread for you. When it comes to machine learning,
    that’s the kind of mistake I see businesses making over and over.</p><p>If you’re
    opening a bakery, it’s a great idea to hire an experienced baker well-versed in
    the nuances of making delicious bread and pastry. You’d also want an oven. While
    it’s a critical tool, I bet you wouldn’t charge your top pastry chef with the
    task of knowing how to build that oven; so why is your company focused on the
    equivalent for machine learning?</p><p>Are you in the business of making bread?
    Or making ovens?</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Yi1y98MLXsbWKUhkL_r2aw.png"
    alt="These are different businesses! Unfortunately, too many machine learning
    projects fail because the team doesn’t know whether they’re supposed to build
    the oven, the recipe, or the bread."><em>These are different businesses! Unfortunately,
    too many machine learning projects fail because the team doesn’t know whether
    they’re supposed to build the oven, the recipe, or the bread.</em></p><h3>Machine
    learning research</h3><p>What they don’t tell you is that all those machine learning
    courses and textbooks are about how to build ovens (and microwaves, blenders,
    toasters, kettles… the kitchen sink!) from scratch, not how to cook things and
    innovate with recipes.</p><p>If you build machine learning algorithms, your focus
    is general purpose tools for others to use. (Kitchen appliances, if you prefer
    the analogy.) This business is called <strong>machine learning research</strong>
    and is typically done by places like <a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/">academia</a>
    or <a href="https://ai.google/research/">Google</a>.</p><blockquote><h1>When it
    comes to machine learning, many organizations are in the wrong business.</h1></blockquote><p>You
    need quite a lot of education to be in this line of work, because there’s a long
    history here. Some popular <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_emperor">algorithms</a>
    have been around for centuries. For example, the method of least squares for regression,
    was <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aos/1176345451">published
    in 1805</a>. Trust me, humanity has come a long way in 200 years.</p><p>Today,
    there are some pretty sophisticated appliances out there… how are you going to
    build a better microwave if you don’t know how this one works? Of course you need
    all that immersive study! Becoming a researcher takes years and there’s a good
    reason that the 101 course starts with the basics of calculus.</p><h3>Applied
    machine learning</h3><p>Most businesses just want to get cooking — to solve their
    business problems. They have no interest in selling microwaves, and yet often
    make the mistake of trying to build those appliances from scratch. It’s hard to
    blame them — the current hype and education cycle dominantly focuses on research,
    instead of application.</p><p>If you’re innovating with recipes, don’t reinvent
    the wheel. Those microwaves exist already. You can get them for free from <a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/datascience/choosing-an-open-source-machine-learning-framework-tensorflow-theano-torch-scikit-learn-caffe/">many
    places</a>. And if setting up your own machine learning kitchen sounds like a
    chore, providers like <a href="http://bit.ly/gcp-hello">Google Cloud Platform</a>
    let you use theirs, complete with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/">appliances</a>,
    <a href="http://bit.ly/gcp-publicdata">ingredients</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/">recipe
    books</a>.</p><blockquote><h1>If you’re innovating in the kitchen, don’t reinvent
    the wheel.</h1></blockquote><p>For most <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_realitycheck">applications</a>,
    your team doesn’t need to understand the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suriyadeepan/deeplearning/master/doc/01_ConceptsInNN/04_TheoreticalFrameworkForBP.pdf">mathematics
    of backpropagation in neural networks</a> any more than a chef needs to know the
    wiring diagram for a microwave. But there’s a lot that you do need to know if
    you’re planning on running an industrial-scale kitchen, everything from curating
    your ingredients to checking that your dishes are good before you serve them.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*5rR1VPwwyX4KAAh_qpoz9Q.png" alt="Which
    of these are you selling? The right team to hire depends on your answer."><em>Which
    of these are you selling? The right team to hire depends on your answer.</em></p><h3>Crashing
    and burning with machine learning</h3><p>Unfortunately, I see a lot of businesses
    failing to get value from machine learning because they don’t realize that the
    applied side is a very different discipline from the algorithms research side.
    Instead, <strong>leaders try to start their kitchens by hiring those folks who’ve
    been building microwave parts their whole lives but have never cooked a thing.</strong>
    What could possibly go wrong? If that works out, it’s because you got lucky and
    accidentally hired an engineer who is a great chef.</p><p>But usually you’re not
    lucky. There are only so many hours in one lifetime, and if you spend them learning
    how a microwave is wired, you’ve got fewer to devote to mastering the art of pastry
    or business. Where — and when! — would your PhD-trained artificial intelligence
    researcher have gained the skills required for applied machine learning? If you
    set your heart on the hybrid who’s an expert in both, no wonder you’re complaining
    about the talent shortage!</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*33PCsWLHkqYV00Fq.jpg"
    alt="If you try to start a restaurant by hiring folks who’ve been building microwave
    parts their whole lives but have never cooked a thing… what could possibly go
    wrong?"><em>If you try to start a restaurant by hiring folks who’ve been building
    microwave parts their whole lives but have never cooked a thing… what could possibly
    go wrong?</em></p><p>Whom should you hire instead? Just like in an industrial
    kitchen, you need an interdisciplinary team with leadership that understands this
    space. Otherwise, projects fizzle and go nowhere.</p><h3>Hiring the right team
    for the job</h3><p>If you’re selling cutting-edge appliances, hire researchers.
    If you’re innovating in recipes to sell food at scale, you need people who figure
    out what’s worth cooking / what the objectives are (<em>decision-makers and product
    managers</em>), people who understand the suppliers and the customers (<em>domain
    experts and social scientists</em>), people who can process ingredients at scale
    (<em>data engineers and analysts</em>), people who can try many different ingredient-appliance
    combinations quickly to generate potential recipes (<em>applied ML engineers</em>),
    people who can check that the quality of the recipe is good enough to serve (<a
    href="https://towardsdatascience.com/statistics-for-people-in-a-hurry-a9613c0ed0b">*statisticians</a><em>),
    people who turn a potential recipe into millions of dishes served efficiently
    (</em>software engineers<em>), people who keep the interdisciplinary team on track
    (</em>project/program managers<em>), and people who ensure that your dishes stay
    top notch even if the delivery truck brings you a ton of potatoes instead of the
    rice you ordered (</em>reliability engineers*).</p><p>While these needn’t be separate
    individuals, be sure you’ve got each role covered. And before you fling your rotten
    tomato at me for providing such an incomplete caricature, I’ll freely admit that
    there’s much more to say about hiring for applied machine learning. I’ve outsourced
    that to other posts, including <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_roles">this one</a>.</p><p>Speaking
    of outsourcing, if your team has tried all existing tools and can’t make a recipe
    that meets your business objectives, it makes sense to think about adding skills
    in building appliances (<em>researcher</em>). Whether or not you hire that person
    to your permanent staff or outsource the job to an experienced algorithms research
    firm depends on the scale and maturity of your operation.</p><p>Another reason
    to connect with researchers is that your prototype is so successful that using
    custom-built appliances makes sense at the massive scale you’re lucky enough to
    operate at. (What a great problem to have!)</p><h3>Decision intelligence</h3><p>Experts
    should be talking about this, but they aren’t. They’re not owning up to the fact
    that there’s really two machine learnings here, and so the world is training people
    in building all these algorithms but not in using them.</p><p>My team is working
    to fix that. We’ve created a new discipline to cover the applied side and we’ve
    already trained over 15,000 staff members in it. We’re calling it <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_di">**decision
    intelligence</a>**, and it spans all the applied aspects of machine learning and
    data science.</p><p>To put it another way, if research machine learning is building
    microwaves and applied machine learning is using microwaves, <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_toa">decision
    intelligence</a> is using microwaves safely to meet your goals and using something
    else when you don’t need a microwave.</p><h3><strong>Good luck and have fun!</strong></h3><p>When
    it comes to applied machine learning, the hardest part is knowing what you want
    to cook and how you plan to check it before you serve it to your customers. That
    part is actually not that hard —<a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_island"> just
    don’t forget to do it</a>.</p><p>As for the rest, solving business problems with
    machine learning is far easier than most people think. Those gleaming kitchens
    are waiting for you to come play in them. Dive in as you would in a real kitchen.
    Start tinkering! Every time I meet someone who believes they need to take a traditional
    machine learning algorithms course — or, goodness! a whole degree — in order to
    get started, I can’t help but imagine them refusing to use microwaves until they
    built one themselves. Don’t fall for the lie that says you need a PhD to do amazing
    things with machine learning. Instead, what you really need is a bit of <a href="http://bit.ly/quaesita_island">human
    creativity</a>. Good luck and have fun!</p>'

  :title: 'I Once Talked To Seth Godin On The Phone: Here’s How It Changed My Life
    and Business'
  :content: '<p>I Once Talked To Seth Godin On The Phone: Here’s How It Changed My
    Life and Business</p><p>It was a year ago. I had 15 people working for me, my
    business was losing money every month, I was stressed beyond belief, and everyone
    thought I was successful. “You know, Jeff,” my business coach told me, “you don’t
    have to do this.”</p><p>But I did. At least, I thought I did. When you’re good
    at something, you have to keep doing it even if it’s killing you, right?</p><p>After
    bootstrapping my company to a million dollars, I was now living in the stressful
    reality of running a seven-figure company.</p><p>So I did what smart entrepreneurs
    do in this situation. I hired a coach.</p><h2>From blogger to CEO</h2><p>I thought
    things would be easier, but now they were harder than ever. So, I reached out
    to my friend <a href="http://caseygraham.com/">Casey Graham</a> to help me make
    sense of this.</p><p>Casey coaches business owners on how to scale their companies,
    helping entrepreneurs become CEOs. Here’s what he told me when I asked to stop
    feeling so stressed about running a business:</p><blockquote><p>First, you’ll
    need to work harder than you’ve ever worked before. For the next 24 months, you’re
    going to have act more like a CEO and less like a writer. It’s not going to be
    easy, you’re probably going to hate it, but in the end, you’ll be able to get
    out of your business and do what you really want.</p></blockquote><p>This sounded
    like the advice from a friend who runs a software company: “Your life is going
    to suck for the next two years, but after that things will be great.”</p><p><em>Okay,
    great,</em> I thought. <em>I can do that. It’s only two years. If this is what
    it takes to succeed, this is what must be done.</em></p><p>Together, Casey and
    I mapped out a plan that included $600,000 in new salaries, a bigger team, lots
    of expenses, more work, and even more stress. And for six months, I worked the
    plan, pursuing this dream of freedom, updating my coach every week.</p><p>But
    each week, my anxiety grew. And each week, Casey told me the same thing: “You
    don’t have to do this.” Still, I kept going.</p><p>My love for the work decreased.
    I stopped writing altogether. As the company grew, expenses increased, and there
    were even a few months when we lost money. As someone who grew up lower middle
    class, I worried I was going to bankrupt myself trying to scale this thing.</p><p>I
    was sleeping less, eating more, and not having very much fun. In the back of my
    mind, I wondered: <em>Is this what growth is supposed to feel like?</em></p><h2>How
    a phone call with Seth Godin changed everything</h2><p>I shared my concerns with
    Casey, and once again he said, “Jeff, you don’t have to do this. Why don’t you
    take the next few days to decide what you <em>really</em> want?”</p><p>I contacted
    a few friends and mentors, people I’d admired for years and respected how they
    had grown their own businesses. One person was <a href="http://sethgodin.com/">Seth
    Godin</a>, a best-selling author and successful entrepreneur. He was someone who
    represented my equal interests in art and business.</p><p>Within an hour, Seth
    responded to my short email with an even shorter reply: “Call me.” And in the
    email was his cell phone number.</p><p>Over the course of a twenty-minute phone
    call, Seth blew my mind. He asked about the business — why I started it, how it
    was structured, and what my goals were.</p><p>“I want to spread ideas that change
    culture,” I said, eagerly.</p><p>“That’s your mission,” he corrected, “not a business
    goal. Don’t expect to always get paid for your mission.”</p><p>“Oh,” I said. “Well,
    we sell online <a href="http://tribewriters.com/">courses</a> that help writers
    get paid and published.”</p><p>“Good,” he said. “Now, that’s a business. Why did
    you start it?”</p><p>“Because, I guess, I wanted freedom.”</p><p>Then he said
    something I won’t ever forget:</p><p>“Don’t build a business because you want
    freedom. Build a business because you want to run a business.”</p><p>Seth laid
    out two options for me:</p><ol><li><p>Scale my business, graduate to CEO, and
    acquire other businesses to help deal with the churn of my industry, eventually
    creating an 8- or 9-figure company and selling it.</p></li><li><p>Keep the business
    at the same size and focus on profitability instead of growth, saving at least
    half the money I make every year. Then, with that free time and energy, focus
    on my craft.</p></li></ol><p>“There will be times,” he said of the second option,
    “when you will get paid what you’re worth. And there will be times when you won’t.”</p><p>“What
    happens when I’m not paid what I’m worth?” I asked, worried.</p><p>“That’s why
    you put half your money in the bank.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>We concluded the phone
    call with my telling Seth I would consider both options. But in my mind, the decision
    had already been made.</p><h2>How I strategically scaled back</h2><p>The next
    day, I was making breakfast for my kids, flipping pancakes in our kitchen, thinking
    about my schedule for the day. I didn’t have any commitments until 11:30. It was
    8:30.</p><p>I looked at my daughter and my son who were 6 months and four years
    old respectively. I thought about spending the next two years of their lives trying
    to scale a business, which felt like precious time to spend on something I didn’t
    intend to do for the rest of my life.</p><p><em>I don’t want to run a business</em>,
    I thought.</p><p>The next day, I started making decisions that over the past six
    months have changed everything.</p><p>First, I <strong>right-sized my business</strong>.
    I decided to stop growing. Bigger wasn’t better. Smaller was better. More manageable
    was better. <em>Better</em> was better. This meant making tough decisions — letting
    go of key team members, canceling contracts with talented people, cutting unnecessary
    expenses. Basically, doing the exact opposite of what you’re told you need to
    do to “scale.”</p><p>Then, I <strong>focused on what only I could do</strong>.
    Your “highest best” as my <a href="http://sethbarnes.com/">old boss</a> used to
    call it. For me, that’s writing. I knew I was in a bad place when I had outsourced
    everything I enjoyed doing and adopted a new set of responsibilities that I didn’t.</p><p>Finally,
    I <strong>decided to stay in my lane</strong>. I changed the game I was playing
    — how I was keeping score, what “winning” was, and so many other things.</p><p>And
    guess what?</p><p>I felt a lot happier. I had more time to write, more freedom,
    and was generally a nicer person. I kept a small but lean team of three full-time
    employees plus myself. We all wear a few different hats, and it’s not always easy,
    but it works.</p><p>Our top line hasn’t grown much, but the bottom line has soared.
    We’ve basically tripled our profits. We had a 70% profit margin the other month.
    Crazy.</p><p>More important than that, this feels right. This feels like me, not
    like trying to be other people and horribly failing at it.</p><p>It’s like that
    May Sarton poem where she says, “<a href="https://allpoetry.com/Now-I-Become-Myself">Now
    I become myself</a>.” In that poem, she talks about trying on other people’s faces
    and it not working, because it never works. That was me. And now, I’m learning
    how to be okay with who I am and what I do.</p><h2>Lessons learn on not scaling
    your business</h2><p>Seth was right. If you start a business to buy yourself freedom,
    you are in it for the wrong reasons. Do it because you love it, because it’s your
    calling, not because you think it’s going to give you the life you want.</p><p>So,
    here are the lessons I learned:</p><ul><li><p><strong>You can’t have what other
    people have if you aren’t willing to do what they do.</strong> In my case, my
    ego wanted the prestige that came with having a big company without wanting to
    spend the time and money to get there.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sometimes, you don’t
    need to grow to get what you really want.</strong> For me, the business was a
    means to make an income while I continue to write.</p></li><li><p><strong>If you
    feel like you’re losing, change the game you’re playing.</strong> Hanging out
    with my entrepreneur friends always made me feel small and insignificant until
    I realized we were really playing different games.</p></li></ul><p>Today, there
    is a lot of pressure for writers and creatives to start a business, make money
    doing something they’re not passionate about in hopes of finally having the time
    to do what they really love. On one hand, there’s wisdom here. You don’t want
    to be another <a href="https://goinswriter.com/die/">Starving Artist</a>, after
    all.</p><p>But nobody ever told me you can <a href="http://dontstarve.com/">create
    your best work <em>and</em> thrive</a>. For me, that meant having a business but
    not feeling the pressure to scale it. It meant being content with where I am and
    focusing on what I want, which is to be a great writer and spend time with my
    family.</p><p>So that’s what I did, and I couldn’t be happier. If you’ve felt
    the pressure to build something big to do what you really want to do, remember
    these words: <em>you don’t have to do this</em>. You can create the life you want
    without playing somebody else’s game.</p>'

  :title: Build a Business, Not a Financial Machine
  :content: '<p>Today, there’s a complete disrespect for what it takes to build a
    business. Too many people think they can become an entrepreneur overnight and
    establish a real business in a 1–2 year window, but it’s just not realistic.</p><p>And
    I get it, because that’s what’s portrayed in the media we see every day. With
    <em>Shark Tank</em>, <em>The Social Network</em>, and all of these “unicorns”
    with quick exits and huge payouts, I can understand why the sentiment is skewed.
    There’s a <a href="https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/why-you-shouldnt-take-vc-money-3/">misconception</a>
    that just because a VC or “angel” throws cash your way, hoping that you’re the
    next Zucks, that your startup is going to be successful. But that’s not how it
    works. It’s the market that decides what works and what doesn’t.</p><p>And what
    about the tens of thousands of other “businesses” we don’t hear about: Those that
    fell face-flat because they focused on building a toy on top of VC money rather
    than building an actual revenue-generating business? Where’s that discussion?</p><p>Too
    many “entrepreneurs” these days are focusing their day-to-day trying to raise
    their next round, siphoning their own equity out of the business to artificially
    inflate their company’s valuation rather than focusing on what’s actually important:
    Building a sustainable business.</p><p>They’re acting as financial arbitrage machines,
    not actual businesses. And that’s a problem.</p><p>I get hit up constantly — day
    in and day out — from people looking to raise money for the “earth shattering”
    and “disruptive” idea they have. You know what’s a disruptive idea? Building an
    actual business that has investors coming to you, not you chasing them.</p><p>When
    I started <a href="http://vaynermedia.com/">VaynerMedia</a> I didn’t take any
    outside investment and, to this day, I continue to run on thin margins. Why? Because
    I’ve built, and continue to build an actual business. All of the money we brought
    in and continue to bring in is thrown back into the company and deployed against
    growth to accomplish the things that will get us to where we want to be. I have
    a north star and I’m working against it.</p><p>Why can I do that? Because I’m
    <strong>patient</strong>. Because I understand what it means to build a business.
    I’m not in it for the glory — for the watches, the nice house, the boats, the
    shit you see plastered on Instagram. I’m in it because I love the grind. And if
    you’re a true bred entrepreneur, that’s what should drive you too.</p><p>So, if
    you have the audacity to want to build something that’s going to set you up for
    the rest of your life, <strong>to provide you with the freedom of someone else
    not signing your paycheck</strong>, don’t disrespect what it takes to get there.</p><p>And
    to be fair, that disrespect isn’t necessarily your fault either. Mainstream media
    is painting a too-good-to-be-true picture of what entrepreneurship looks like
    and that needs to stop. With all of these hyperbolized headlines and “million
    dollar exits,” it’s imperative we redefine what it means to be a successful founder.
    Everyone wants to sell their business for millions because that’s the story that’s
    been told to us but it’s just not reality. The overselling of what it ‘means’
    to be successful is what’s going to hurt most of you in the end and I’m going
    to do what I can to change that conversation.</p><p>So all I ask is that we reframe
    the discussion being had around entrepreneurship.There’s no short cuts. No magic
    formula that will make a successful business. No promise that VC funding will
    make your “earth-shattering” idea successful. There’s just the truth. And that’s
    hard work.</p>'

  :title: 2017 KEY TO SMALL BUSINESS SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING
  :content: '<p>Here’s my 2017 New Year’s resolution to you: I want you to focus on
    your organic social media reach for the next year. As we wrap up 2016, I’ve been
    reviewing my core strategy for my personal brand and why it matters for all of
    my clients, small business friends, contemporaries, and others putting out branded
    content. Over the past year, I got really serious about putting out content on
    YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat, and, most recently, Instagram as they introduced
    new platform features.</p><p>Take a look at this Google Trends chart:</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2522/0*DImm0p1i2H-MkCQ5.png" alt=""></p><p>This
    is what you see when you type in “Gary Vaynerchuk.”</p><p>A lot happened this
    year with my personal brand. But, what’s most fascinating to me is the minimal
    amount of money I put behind paid advertising. Yes, I put money behind some YouTube
    pre-rolls and paid for the amplification of some Facebook video, but not to the
    levels of what the majority of you spend (or would spend) to see big results.</p><p>When
    you start to really understanding what social media is today (in 2016) and where
    it’s going in 2017, you start realizing that social media is just the slang term
    for the current state of the internet.</p><p>Here’s the key statement: In 2017,
    if you are a business or organization of any kind that wants to be heard in the
    world, refocusing on the content you put out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
    Snapchat, YouTube, Linkedin, Medium, and whatever else has the market’s attention
    at the time, is a huge factor.</p><p>For the last two to three years, people have
    dismissed organic content because of the rise of paid advertising. And yes, paid
    social media has enormous upside and incredible and, in my opinion, is the best
    deal in all of advertising (aside from <a href="https://youtu.be/rBkUJ5qJsJ0?t=19m6s">advertising
    during the Super Bowl</a>). However, what has emerged in the paranoia of everyone
    thinking social media only works when you spend money, is a lack of hustle and
    a lack of understanding that great content, especially when amplified in subtle
    ways, can be unbelievably effective.</p><p>What I mean by “amplified in subtle
    ways” is that, for example, if you just start using the proper hashtags on Instagram,
    you can easily start being discovered over time. Whether you’re a local pizza
    shop or a car dealership, or an artist, or rapper, or a Fortune 500 B2B company,
    using hashtags is an unbelievably organic way to hit discoverability and create
    amplification for your content. And if you have paid media dollars, even just
    spending $100–300 a week on the amplification of your YouTube and Facebook video
    content, it can make your content explode.</p><p>Here’s the thing: no amount of
    paid media is going to turn bad creative into good content. It’s the same way
    that <a href="https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/why-you-shouldnt-take-vc-money-3/">no
    amount of VC money</a> is going to save a bad product. That’s why you need to
    invest in the long-game of improving your brand’s content (and you do that by
    creating a lot of it).</p><p>Basically, here’s my overall belief: if you’re a
    small business, you want to focus on spending your time, money, and effort on
    creating great content (and a lot of it). You should be spending $85,000 a year
    on creating quality content and only another $35,000 on paid amplification — not
    the other way around. It excites me to no end to think about the fact that most
    small business (and even A-list personalities) waste $250,000–500,000 a year on
    tactics like websites, PR, direct mail, or paid media when they could have just
    gone all in on organic social content and a small amplification budget to achieve
    more valuable results.</p><p>The biggest thing people don’t understand is that
    quality content is so important to marketing to anyone under the age of 40 right
    now. Anyone in that demographic discovers a business for the first time by either:
    (A) Google searching or (B) finding their content on social media. If you are
    not crushing it and focusing on the content that you put out on the most important
    social platforms, you’re going to become mute and obsolete in the modern day of
    doing business. That’s why organic reach is so important because the impression
    you get when someone comes directly to your page is a much more qualified lead
    and potentially a more valuable customer than someone you got through an ad buy.</p><blockquote><h1><em>No
    amount of paid media is going to turn bad creative into good content.</em></h1></blockquote><p>There’s
    plenty of different paid tactics (Facebook Advertising, Instagram influencer marketing,
    YouTube pre-rolls, Snapchat new ad product, etc.) that will help grow your audience,
    but the opportunity to get very serious about the content that you put out in
    an organic way on social networks matter. Why? Because it is the most natural
    and current state of the internet. While the supply and demand shift for paid
    media becomes more saturated, it leaves an incredible opening for the brands that
    make great content to grow the right way.</p><h2>Thanks for reading! :) If you

    by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sambourke">Sam Bourke</a> on Unsplash (thanks
    brother).</em></p><p>June 21st, 2019, was my last day in a salaried job.</p><p>Since
    then, I’ve been working for myself, running an online business from various cafes
    and my bedroom.</p><p>Someone asked at the start of the year what my goal was
    for the end of the year. I had none except to still be in business. So far, so
    good. You see, going from making $0 online to $1 online is hard. But once you’ve
    got a taste, you can use the same principles to keep the momentum going.</p><p>The
    main one, regardless of whether you’re at $0 per month or $100,000 per month:
    Bring people value that they’re willing to pay for.</p><p>How can you do this?</p><p>Build
    skills and teach people how to perform that skill. Entertain someone so they’d
    be disappointed if you were gone. Create a product someone wants in their lives.</p><p>Of
    course, there are more, and you can mix and match them to suit your tastes. The
    red thread being, you have to create something.</p><p>Once you have a paying customer,
    you’re a business.</p><h2>How do I make money?</h2><p>Before working for myself,
    every job I had, I’d exchange time for money. I’d get paid for the hours I was
    there. 9–5? That’s 7.5 hours. Come on, you didn’t think you’d get paid for lunch,
    did you? No sir.</p><p>The first benefit of this depends on the job; you’ve got
    an opportunity to learn skills that you can use in your business. One of the ideal
    situations in life is to get paid to learn.</p><p>The second is you can use the
    funds from your regular job to fund your business.</p><p>That’s what I did.</p><p>My
    last two jobs were working for Apple as a Genius (the one who talks to customers
    fixes your computers) and as a machine learning engineer for Max Kelsen.</p><p>So
    the skills I built there were explaining technology in an understandable way (Apple
    tech support) and writing machine learning code to help various businesses get
    information out of their data.</p><p>My primary source of income is now at the
    crossover of those two. I created a <a href="https://dbourke.link/mlcourse">beginner-friendly
    machine learning course</a> to teach people how to do what I was doing as a machine
    learning engineer.</p><p>This didn’t happen overnight.</p><p>The good news is,
    once you realize your brain is comprised of programmable mush, mostly in the form
    of hydrogen atoms, you’ve got the recipe you need to start changing direction.
    In other words, learning what you need to learn and creating what you want to
    create.</p><p>In 2016, I switched my balance from consuming to creating. A line
    in the sand. A strict rule to start making more things than I consumed.</p><p>I
    became a frozen yogurt machine. All output. Blog posts, videos on YouTube, Medium
    articles, all around the topic of me studying <a href="https://dbourke.link/aimastersdegree">my
    self-created machine learning master’s degree</a>, and sharing what I’d learned.</p><p>Through
    this, eventually, people found my work and started asking questions.</p><p>The
    most consistent one being, “I want to learn machine learning, where do I start?”.
    To which I’d usually answer with a list of curated resources.</p><p>But despite
    an opportunity hitting me in the face (I’d get the question almost daily), it
    took me longer than I care to admit to starting answering it properly.</p><p>The
    history books will show, I left my job, wrote an article about the 12 things I
    learned during my first year as a machine learning engineer, a few people read
    it, including someone called Andrei. He’d created a few technology courses and
    was looking to create one on machine learning. He asked if I wanted to partner,
    and after doing my research, I said yes. It turns out Andrei was one of the most
    popular instructors on Udemy (an online platform for selling and participating
    in community-made courses).</p><p>And since launching our course on January 17,
    2020, I’ve made more from it than I did for the whole time I worked at my last
    job.</p><p>Let’s get a little specific, shall we?</p><p>The skill I get paid for
    is at the crossover of machine learning and communication. Breaking down an intimidating
    topic in a way others can understand.</p><p>This crossover led to the following
    income sources (all in USD):</p><ul><li><p>My machine learning course on Udemy
    — $5000-$8000/month</p></li><li><p>Affiliate partnership with Coursera (an online
    learning platform for technology and other topics) — $500-$2000/month</p></li><li><p>Affiliate
    partnership with DataCamp (an online learning platform for data-related topics)
    — $150–350/month</p></li><li><p>Premium Medium articles — $250–2000/month</p></li><li><p>YouTube
    ad revenue (I’ve never claimed this, it’s still sitting in Google’s bank account)
    — $300–600/month</p></li><li><p>Other misc sources — $50-$200/month</p></li></ul><p>The
    first thing you might notice is none of these amounts are set in stone. Unlike
    a salary, there’s some variability here.</p><p>Some months might be higher, and
    some months might be lower. Some can’t handle the instability. But as you’ll see
    later, I think it’s a good thing.</p><h2>Opportunity staring you in the face</h2><p>I
    had people asking me daily, “I want to learn machine learning, where do I start?”.</p><p>It’s
    a question I’d asked myself when I started, and one that I’d spent the past 2-years
    solving for myself.</p><p>And when I finally did solve it for someone else, I
    had a customer.</p><p>The takeaway?</p><p>If you’re looking for an opportunity
    to start your own business, it might be right in front of you.</p><p>If not…it’s
    time to create your own opportunity.</p><p>Before making a single $1 online, I
    spent over a year creating things and publishing them (keyword: publishing), building
    skills, making nothing.</p><p>It was my form of an apprenticeship. You see, when
    I began, the things I was creating weren’t that good.</p><p>And the same will
    go for you. When you begin, you’ll lack skills like the ability to connect what’s
    in your head to what comes out of your hands or mouth. That’s okay. Everyone goes
    through this right of passage.</p><p>My secret? Blind faith in whatever I was
    doing would eventually pay off.</p><p>Remember: creating your own business online
    means creating value for others in one way or another.</p><p>For me, it came in
    the form of videos and articles.</p><p>Don’t overthink it.</p><p>Write about it
    instead. You never know who will reach out</p><h2>Whatever business you’re in,
    you’re in the education business</h2><p>Step one, create a valuable product.</p><p>Step
    two, educate people on what they’re buying.</p><p>Don’t be confused when you think
    people buy your product because they want the product itself. Your customers don’t
    buy your product as much as they buy the story they can tell themselves after
    buying your product.</p><p>In my case, as of now, my main product is a machine
    learning course for beginners.</p><p>Now, do people buy the machine learning course
    because of the 42.5 hours of video content? Or the beautifully crafted presentations
    and hand-drawn drawings? Or is it because they’re looking for a change? To learn
    something new. To hop on board the magic carpet ride, which is current technology
    trends? To fill their sails with the tailwinds of a society leveraging machine
    learning to fuel progress?</p><p>That’s what I’m selling.</p><p>I’m selling an
    opportunity for someone to learn one of the most powerful technologies going around.</p><p>I’m
    selling the story that when you hear of some large company using machine learning
    to build cars that drive themselves to the grocery store, you no longer have to
    be a bystander. Instead, why not join in.</p><p>I’ve got the most important job
    in the world: Adding fuel to the fire in the hearts of those eager to learn.</p><p>Once
    you’ve built something of value, your marketing isn’t telling people what it is;
    they’re smart enough to figure that out, telling them how they can use it.</p><h2>The
    first hire, are you replaceable?</h2><p>The first 3-months my machine learning
    course was live; I answered every single question myself. And so I should. I put
    the thing out there, and I should be the one who gets to see where it’s weak.</p><p>You
    see, I struggle to release control. I find it hard to put trust in someone else
    to a job as good as myself. Call it ego, call it lack of experience, call it what
    you want. I’m working on it.</p><p>My worries were squashed after Andrei and I
    hired a teacher’s assistant, Shubhamai, to answer questions for our machine learning
    course.</p><p>How’d we hire him?</p><p>The trial was, answer a few questions and
    see how things go.</p><p>It turns out, Shubamai is an absolute and complete living
    legend. He takes care of the questions even better than I did. He inspires me
    to do better work.</p><p>The lesson?</p><p>Hire people smarter than you (if your
    ego can handle it).</p><h2>Money is replenishable, time is not</h2><p>I’m now
    at the point — the crossover where more money doesn’t make you happier.</p><p>It’s
    the improvement I’m after, the striving, the challenge. More money masquerades
    the real journey — the journey to mastery. And you know what? Money stands in
    the shadow of the best currency in the world: the effect you have on others.</p><p>But
    feeling good doesn’t pay for food.</p><p>This first year, I’m focused on cashflow.
    Get the money through the door, pay for bills and living expenses, use the rest
    build a war chest. And for God’s sake, keep those expenses low man. You don’t
    need anything more than a keyboard and an internet connection to create value.</p><p>Once
    cashflow is taken care of, it won’t be the primary goal month-to-month. Building
    skills will be the primary goal. It was improving at the crafts that got me here.</p><p>I
    can always earn more money, whereas having the energy and drive I do now to improve
    may not always be around, so I’m taking advantage of it.</p><p>You see, if you
    get stuck optimizing for cashflow month-to-month, you’ll get good at that. Perhaps
    that’s what you’re after (and if it’s early on, it should be), but if not, focus
    on continually building skill.</p><h2>What does one do with an empty calendar
    and no set hours? An example day</h2><p>Every small business owner knows that
    scheduling is essential. Upon waking up, I write a list of what needs to get done
    for the day.</p><p>I base the day list on the week list, which focuses on what
    needs to get done for the week. I base the week list on my ideal life over the
    next 3–5 years.</p><p>As in, the answer to the question, “If I woke up today in
    3-years time, how would I like to spend my time?”. Of course, impossible to predict,
    but that doesn’t mean it’s not fun (and important) to answer.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3820/1*W0GZfEBY0_yEAG3TueOMhQ.jpeg"

  :title: My Friend Lost His Business After a 15-Minute Speech
  :content: '<p>The Coronavirus ended his ten-year business journey and it will inspire
    you during these tough times.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2952/1*tdJL_0acM4m10w-03coQbw.jpeg"
    alt="Image Credit: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images"><em>Image Credit: Richard Heathcote/Getty
    Images</em></p><p>With the uncertain times we live in, I did the rounds over the
    last few days and began ringing every person in my phone. The reason for my call
    was to make sure each person was okay.</p><p>I didn’t expect any surprises and
    assumed everybody in my phone’s contact list would be at home relaxing in isolation
    with their families. That was until I rang a lifelong friend.</p><p>The two of
    us met on MySpace when I was a teenager. Without him, I would never have had a
    music career. He was the first person to believe in the fruits of my creative
    endeavours, which eventually led me to write.</p><p>Over the last ten years, he
    had built up a large business with many employees in the hospitality industry.
    He took his passions of food, entertainment, music and customer service, and fused
    them into an unstoppable business. The part I loved most about his journey is
    that he always remained humble and took care of the people he worked with like
    they were his own flesh and blood.</p><p>The conversation started like this:</p><blockquote><p>“How
    are you doing?”“I’ve had my fair share of tears this week. I lost my entire business
    after a 15-minute speech.”</p></blockquote><p>It was a surreal moment. I didn’t
    expect to hear about the impacts on business so soon. The speech my friend was
    referring to was given by the Prime Minister of Australia. It was short and sharp
    and basically placed a ban on large gatherings. His words encouraged us to stay
    in our homes.</p><p>The key to his speech was sensible, but for the hospitality
    industry, it meant instant shut down. The bars, club, and restaurants had two
    options: 1) Try to remain open and pay rent. 2) Shut down their venues and show
    defeat, thus getting them out of their rental obligations with their landlord.</p><p>The
    majority of the hospitality industry chose option two. It meant instant business
    closure and helped contain the financial downside.</p><p>At the conclusion of
    the speech, my friend knew his fate was sealed. His phone lit up over the next
    hour and his inbox was overloaded. All of his clients had cancelled their contracts
    and walked away from their businesses. Not one of them remained open. Most of
    his clients were fearful and in a state of panic. By the end of the day, his business
    had evaporated into thin air and he had to lay off all of his staff.</p><p>This
    is not a sad story, though. It was what came next from this seemingly dire situation
    that surprised me about my friend.</p><p>When I asked him what he was doing about
    it, he gave me this list of strategies that might help you during this difficult
    time.</p><h3>Long Walks</h3><p>Going for walks each day helped him clear his mind.
    Sticking to the social distancing rules, he found peace and calmness in long walks.</p><p>You
    can live in the suburbs like my friend for over a decade and never walk around
    your own neighbourhood.</p><p>My friend used this opportunity to change that.
    He took daily walks around his neighbourhood and started noticing the little things.
    Which way do the ducks walk? Why does the lake have small ripples of water on
    one side? What does the local park look like when it’s deserted?</p><h3>Gardening</h3><p>I
    was not expecting this one at all. My friend found solace in the garden. He planted
    new seeds in the ground hoping they would grow, as his mind recovered from what
    had occurred.</p><p>The garden was a place to watch life be reborn when human
    life had lost its shine because of a virus. Nature soothes the soul and removes
    the aches and pains of business.</p><h3>Thinking about those doing it tough</h3><p>Whenever
    he was feeling sorry for himself, thoughts of his workers and their struggle comforted
    him.</p><p>The staff who were laid off got, at best, two weeks pay. The hospitality
    industry doesn’t have all the same protections in Australia as other industries.
    You can go from doing okay and paying your student loans as a casual worker, to
    having no money overnight and trying to pay your electricity bill.</p><p>He was
    scarred from the experience but nowhere near as much as the staff who worked their
    butts off.</p><blockquote><h1>Focusing your thoughts on the struggles of others
    helps heal your mind from selfish thoughts and your own survival.</h1></blockquote><h3>Stay
    calm</h3><p>My friend said over and over that the key to him not losing his mind
    was staying calm.</p><p>This meant removing triggers from his environment that
    might set him off. He limited his news consumption and spent as much time as possible
    with his two young daughters.</p><p>It was impossible for him to be angry at life
    when he had two little girls to look after and their smiles to comfort him.</p><h3>Leave
    people better than you found them</h3><p>At the end of the phone call, I left
    my friend with a few thoughts:</p><ol><li><p>You will come back again when you’re
    ready.</p></li><li><p>Take time off.</p></li><li><p>Your network doesn’t disappear.</p></li><li><p>People
    will remember how you treated them.</p></li><li><p>The worst event can be the
    birth of the most innovative businesses.</p></li></ol><p>We have stayed in contact
    over the years because I’ve been fascinated with my friend’s approach to life.</p><p>He
    always leaves you feeling better than he found you.He makes you smile.He tells
    you the good parts of life.He is fearlessly loyal.He builds human connections,
    not business connections.My favourite: he calls you for no reason at all.</p><p>People
    love working with him and he always lives by one rule:</p><blockquote><h1>Doing
    the right thing is always the right thing.</h1></blockquote><p>What I love most
    about how my friend dealt with this pandemic and the collapse of his business
    is that he didn’t let it defeat him. His heart and soul were all over this situation
    and he wasn’t afraid to admit that he cried many tears. That is a real man right
    there.</p><p>You can do everything right in business and still lose the lot. That
    is the game of entrepreneurship.</p><p>It’s not what you lose; it’s who you become
    in uncertain and difficult times.</p><h3><a href="https://timdenning.net/free-ebook?source=post_page---------------------------">Join

  :title: The Most Powerful Lesson I’ve Ever Learned In Business
  :content: "<p>How to lead by first principles when everything is at stake</p><p>One
    morning in the depths of the 2001/2002 recession, a decision was looming large
    at a crucial strategy meeting I had hurriedly called at our offices in Mountain
    View. It was one of those company defining decisions that come along every so
    often. And it was clear to all of us in the room that what we decided here would
    very likely determine whether our startup, Tellme Networks, would live or die.</p><p>I
    turned to one of my team members, a bright Harvard-educated business leader, and
    asked for his thoughts. He gave a crisp answer on why we should decide in the
    affirmative. I turned to another team member and asked for her thoughts. She had
    similar credentials and gave an equally thoughtful explanation of why we should
    decide in the <em>negative</em>. Two team leaders I respected, each more experienced
    than I was, were passionate about going in two totally different directions. Everyone
    turned and looked at me. The pressure was on and my team was divided.</p><p>We
    had been burning cash quickly and Tellme, a service we were well known for that
    let anyone pick up a phone, say what they wanted and get it (like Siri and Cortana
    today), was not going to get us to profitability anytime soon. As a result, we
    focused on selling access to the platform that powered Tellme. We became the world’s
    first cloud-based speech recognition platform for enterprises and carriers.</p><p>After
    months of hard work and focus we had won accounts like AT&amp;T, Merrill Lynch,
    American Airlines, and FedEx. But this success inevitably caught the attention
    of AT&amp;T, our single largest customer and early investor. They decided to compete
    with us and their executives presented us with an opportunity/ultimatum: license
    the Tellme platform to AT&amp;T, switch from a cloud model to a software model
    and focus on the carrier market. They proposed a large upfront payment with an
    ongoing revenue commitment that would almost certainly swing our startup to profitability.</p><p>The
    decision was stark: finally reach profitability by drastically changing our business
    model OR double down on a nascent cloud-based business model, lose our largest
    customer, burn more cash and face a fearsome competitor. Complicating matters
    further, this was bound to be a deeply controversial situation internally and
    we risked fracturing our team no matter what we decided.</p><blockquote><h1>“You
    can question my judgement but not my integrity.” — Bill Campbell</h1></blockquote><p>There
    are a variety of ways to make a decision like this. Some leaders, especially founders,
    use a combination of instinct, passion, and force of personality. Other leaders
    rely on their sheer intellect, calmly espousing facts and figures that support
    the direction they think they should go. Still others rely on the power of their
    position (“I’m CEO so this is what we’re going to do”).</p><p>But there’s another
    way. It was taught to me by Bill Campbell, former CEO of Intuit and legendary
    coach to Steve Jobs, Larry Page, Ben Horowitz and many other founders. Bill had
    been coaching me on how to make decisions faster and better. This was a major
    area I needed to improve on. How could I make a decision when my team members
    had far more experience than I did (I don’t have a college education and this
    was my first venture-backed startup), especially when they disagreed with each
    other? How could I avoid endless debate? How could I break a tie in a credible
    way? How could I get everyone to support a decision once it was made, even if
    some didn’t agree with the outcome? How could I avoid my team thinking, “How does
    Mike know any better than us? He’s never been in this situation before.”</p><p>Bill
    said, “Well, look: I used to tell people, you can question my judgment, but you
    can’t question my integrity.” He explained that in rare cases you may have to
    make a judgment call but first you should start by agreeing with your team on
    what is definitively true about the situation and then let those facts guide your
    decision.</p><blockquote><h1>First principles are a bigger, more powerful force
    than anyone in the company, including the founders and CEO.</h1></blockquote><p>Meanwhile,
    John Giannandrea, our founding CTO at Tellme (now head of search at Google), had
    taught me about the power of first principles in science. First principles are
    not opinions. They are immutable facts, which, once known, can be built upon to
    enable further discoveries.</p><p>John helped me better appreciate what Bill was
    saying: when faced with a tough decision, seek out the first principles. You can
    build on each first principle to parse a complex decision into its core elements.
    If you do this, the right choice often becomes clear to everyone. In a sense,
    you can <strong>let the first principles make the decision for you</strong>. First
    principles are clinical, emotionless and a bigger, more powerful force than anyone
    in the company, including the founders and CEO.</p><p>For this approach to truly
    work, you as the leader have to act in service to first principles. You have to
    be totally open to supporting whatever the first principles dictate, no matter
    how difficult. After all, integrity is all about upholding principles… And principles
    only matter when they’re hard to keep. It’s not about what you think, what you
    feel, who gives the most convincing argument, or what your title is. It’s about
    seeking out and staying true to first principles, especially in the darkest of
    times.</p><blockquote><h1>Ask your team: “What do we know to be true?”</h1></blockquote><p>Back
    in Mountain View with my team, my heart was pounding and I was incredibly uneasy
    about the building momentum in the room to take the cash, get to profitability,
    and avoid a potentially catastrophic competitive situation. Abandoning our unique
    business and becoming yet another software provider to carriers was a huge price
    to pay for guaranteed profitability. Were we really destined to be a profitable
    company that nobody really cared about except for a few carriers? Is this what
    our team signed up for?</p><p>Remembering Bill’s advice, I resisted the impulse
    to argue passionately against the AT&amp;T deal. Instead I asked, as calmly and
    clinically as I could muster, “What do we know to be true here? For example, can
    we be both a cloud provider <strong>and</strong> a software provider?” The answer
    from the team was swift and unanimous: No, we can’t be both. It would be foolhardy
    to try and run a cloud service while also trying to be a world class software
    provider, especially as a startup; we must pick one or risk failing at both. First
    principle No. 1.</p><p>Then I asked, “Assuming we opt to go with this deal, how
    long will we need to operate our cloud service for our current customers while
    we build the software for AT&amp;T?” Again the team was quick to answer unanimously:
    It would likely take two years or more to complete the transition. That would
    mean being both a cloud service and a software provider for at least two years,
    an eternity for a startup. See first principle No. 1.</p><p>By now bright rays
    of clarity began to shine in the room. Everyone could sense where this was going.
    For good measure I asked, “Assuming we elect to compete with AT&amp;T, when could
    they match our accuracy levels?” (A swing in recognition accuracy of just 1% translates
    into millions of dollars either spent or saved for enterprises.) Again, the answers
    came quickly: Even if AT&amp;T could match our software, it would take years more
    of daily tuning to match our accuracy levels. For the foreseeable future, no customer
    would be able to financially justify running on AT&amp;T instead of Tellme… not
    even AT&amp;T. First principle No. 2.</p><p>Astonishingly, after 45 minutes of
    conversation and with only two first principles, we had arrived at the answer
    to one of the most consequential decisions we had ever faced. Our CEO, whom I
    had hired a year earlier (I demoted myself to COO but that’s a topic for another
    post) looked at me and said, “OK, I’ll give AT&amp;T a call and tell them to go
    pound sand.” The team left the room emboldened and energized. As the years ticked
    by, AT&amp;T tried and failed to build a competitive service while we continued
    to rack up win after win. Soon enough a new executive team took hold at AT&amp;T,
    their competing service was cut, and our partnership grew stronger as they became
    an even larger, more satisfied customer. I’m proud to say that AT&amp;T is still
    running on Tellme to this day… try calling 411 from an AT&amp;T phone.</p><blockquote><h1>Success
    is genuine when you stay true to your principles.</h1></blockquote><p>So to all
    you new founders out there, think about Bill’s advice next time you have a critical
    decision to make with your team. If you seek out and uphold the first principles
    you will not only make a good decision, you’ll do it in a way which strengthens
    your team rather than splintering it. Even in the rare case where the decision
    still doesn’t become obvious and a judgement call must be made, everyone will
    understand how that call was made and, whether they agree or not, they will be
    ready to support it.</p><p>More importantly, remember this: Years from now, when
    you look back on your career, and your life, success or failure will matter a
    lot less than whether you got there by keeping or compromising your principles.</p>"

  :title: HSBC is killing my business, piece by piece — How to plan for your bank
    screwing up
  :content: '<p>I set up my own company in 2012. After decades of working for other
    people I felt the time was right. I had the experience and the contacts to make
    it viable and I was willing to put in the monumental effort needed to embark on
    such a venture. It was a nerve wracking decision, but more than anything it was
    exciting. In April 2012 Photon Storm Ltd was incorporated and began trading.</p><p>After
    talking with my accountant we decided to open an HSBC Business Account here in
    the UK. The process was problem free. They provided me with a company debit card
    and standard banking services. I did my part, ensuring we were always in credit
    and never needing to borrow any money. My accountants looked after the paperwork,
    keeping everything up to date. And <em>we’ve been profitable and maintained a
    healthy positive bank balance since day one</em>.</p><p>Everything was going great
    until Thursday August 10th 2017. I tried to login to our internet banking to pay
    a freelancer and was met with this message:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3522/1*azMjgPHGHwDwiuGCc9v-YQ.jpeg"
    alt="A genuine WTF?! moment if ever there was one"><em>A genuine WTF?! moment
    if ever there was one</em></p><p>At first I assumed it was just a mistake. Maybe
    the anti-fraud team were being a little overzealous and wanted to check some card
    payments? I called them immediately. After bouncing through multiple departments
    I finally end-up talking with <strong>HSBC Safeguarding</strong>. They tell me
    they can’t give any more information, cannot un-suspend the account and would
    need to call me the following week.</p><p>However, the alarm bells were already
    ringing. I knew exactly who the Safeguarding team were because I had talked to
    them earlier in the year after receiving their scary letter. The letter said they
    needed to conduct a <em>business review</em> or they would be forced to suspend
    my account. That’s not the kind of letter you ignore. So I duly responded and
    completed my business review with them. This was 2 months before the account was
    suspended, back in June.</p><p><a href="http://www.business.hsbc.uk/en-gb/gb/campaign/hsbc-safeguard">Safeguarding</a>
    is a process that HSBC is taking all of its accounts through in order to better
    understand how they are used. It’s the fallout of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20673466">HSBC
    receiving a record $1.9 billion fine</a> as a result of a US Senate ruling where
    they were found guilty of allowing money laundering to “drug kingpins and rogue
    nations”.</p><p>It involves them asking all kinds of questions related to what
    you do and the comings and goings on your account. Who are the people and companies
    paying you, and being paid by you? What work was invoice <em>X</em> for? Do you
    have any large sums of money coming in or going out? Which countries do you work
    with? Why do you hold the bank balance you do? and so on.</p><p>It takes around
    an hour and although marketed as offering <em>me</em> protection against financial
    crime, what it was really doing was checking I’m not a drug cartel or rogue nation.
    I am of course neither of these things, but I appreciate they had to check, so
    I answered every question as fully as I could. I was told that if they needed
    more information they would be in touch, otherwise it was all fine.</p><p>Fast
    forward to August 10th and clearly things are not “fine” at all.</p><p>My business
    earns income via two streams:</p><p>1) Game development. A client will request
    a game, usually as part of a marketing campaign and we build it. Sometimes we
    supply everything: the concept, art, coding and support. And other times the client
    will handle the design in-house and we provide the programming that glues it all
    together.</p><p>2) Our second method of income is from our <em>open source software</em>.
    We publish and maintain an HTML5 game framework called <a href="http://phaser.io">Phaser</a>.
    The core library itself is completely free but we make money from the sale of
    plugins and books via our <a href="http://phaser.io/shop">shop</a>, as well as
    our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/photonstorm">Patreon</a>.</p><p>All of this
    was explained to HSBC during our business review.</p><h2>Then they drop the bombshell</h2><p>So
    I wait patiently and anxiously for HSBC to ring. At the appointed time someone
    from the Safeguarding team calls and explains that they want to <em>conduct the
    entire business review again, from scratch</em>. No definitive reason was given
    as to why they needed to do this. It sounded like they were unhappy with the level
    of questioning asked the first time around.</p><p>Frustrated but wanting to resolve
    this as quickly as possible I comply and go through the entire review again, answering
    in even more detail than before, to make it painfully clear what we do and where
    our money comes from.</p><p>The second review ends. I’m told that the information
    is to be sent off to another department who check it, and if they want more details
    they’ll “be in touch”. I’d heard this same line before, back in June and I no
    longer trusted them. I begin calling every day to check on progress. It starts
    taking up to 40 minutes to get through. Clearly they’re dealing with a lot more
    customers now. Every time they tell me the same thing, that the “other” department
    hasn’t looked at it yet, but they’ll be in touch if they need more information
    and “<em>your account will remain suspended in the meantime”</em>.</p><p>No-one
    will admit it’s a mistake that this was even happening. No-one will tell me why
    they didn’t ever call to ask for more details back in June after the first review.
    No-one will tell me why they suspended the account without even notifying me in
    writing. I’ve been wrongfully lumped in with all of those who perhaps didn’t reply
    to their initial warnings and I have to just sit and wait it out. I’ve filed complaints
    via their official channels which have so far** **elicited no response at all.</p><p>*<em>This
    has been going on for *weeks</em>. **At the time of writing our account has been
    suspended for nearly 1 month and I’m still no closer to understanding how much
    longer it will be.</p><p>Also, it appears I am not alone:<a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-hsbc-smallmid/exclusive-small-uk-companies-complain-after-hsbc-accounts-frozen-idUKKCN1B41YO"><strong>Exclusive:
    Small UK companies complain after HSBC accounts frozen</strong><em>An avocado
    importer, an e-cigarette seller and a toilet-cleaning gun maker are among British
    companies that have had…</em>uk.reuters.com</a></p><p>One part of the above article
    in particular stood out to me:</p><blockquote><p>“Inhibiting an account is always
    a last resort, so to get to that stage we will have done everything we can to
    contact the customer and get the information we need,” said Amanda Murphy, head
    of commercial banking for HSBC UK.</p></blockquote><p>Like hell they did.</p><p>Because
    our account is suspended all direct debits linked to it automatically fail. All
    services that store our debit card and try to charge it also fail. We are unable
    to transfer any money out of our business account, which means <em>we cannot pay
    ourselves, our freelancers, or any of our suppliers</em>.</p><p>Like most people
    I’ve been in the situation before where I didn’t have much money. Running on fumes
    come the end of the month, eagerly awaiting my salary. But I have never been in
    the situation where I have all the money I need, that I spent years working hard
    to earn and save, but cannot access a penny of it.</p><p>It’s a uniquely frustrating
    feeling being this powerless.</p><h2>Everything starts to break</h2><p>An interesting
    thing happens when you run a business that relies on internet services to operate
    but have no means of paying them: It starts to break. Not all at once, but in
    small pieces. Like a stress fracture that grows bigger over time. Here is a small
    section of my inbox to give you an idea of the scale of the problem after a few
    weeks:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*nEO8ZNzBU_005igZmECTDg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The first to die was <a href="undefined">GitHub</a>. We have a bunch
    of private repositories and if you don’t pay your GitHub bill they eventually
    close access to the private repos until the account is settled. We store our entire
    web site in a private repo, so we had to pull some funds from our rapidly dwindling
    personal account to cover it, otherwise we literally couldn’t update our site.</p><p>Then
    Apple failed. This was a strange one — it appears you actually need a valid payment
    card associated with your Apple account or you cannot download <em>free apps</em>
    or update existing ones. Every time you try it just asks you to re-enter payment
    details. Not a show-stopper, but frustrating all the same.</p><p>And so it carries
    on. Photoshop, <a href="undefined">Trello</a>, Beanstalk, <a href="undefined">Slack</a>,
    <a href="undefined">GoDaddy</a>, Basecamp, <a href="undefined">SendGrid</a> —
    you name it, when the bill is past due, they all eventually fail. Some of them
    fail more gracefully than others. Adobe at least give you 30 days to resolve the
    issue before <em>turning your software off</em>. SendGrid give you just 48 hours
    to “avoid the suspension and / or limitation of your SendGrid services.”.</p><p>I
    don’t blame any of these organisations for doing this. I have no personal relationship
    with them, they don’t know me from Adam. I’m just another failed bank card to
    them, draining their systems. They don’t understand my situation and to be fair
    they don’t have to care even if they did.</p><p>My web server is hosted with UK
    Fast, who I do have a client relationship with and was able to explain what is
    happening to them. So far they have been excellent and it’s only because of them
    that my web site is even still running and generating my only source of income
    right now.</p><p>But bigger services will start to fail soon. Broadband, the phone
    line, Vodafone, the water and electricity providers that supply the office I work
    from. Even the office rent is due next month. Where possible I’ve told everyone
    I can what is going on but it can’t last for ever.</p><p>Most harrowing of all
    I’ve been unable to pay a member of staff what he is owed. I pushed a personal
    credit card to the limit just to send him some money via TransferWise but he has
    had to find other employment while this mess gets sorted out. I don’t blame him
    at all, I would do the same thing in his situation as I’ve a mortgage to pay,
    a family to feed and bills too. It’s incredibly frustrating knowing the money
    I need to solve all of this is right there, but untouchable.</p><h2>Hints and
    Tips for your bank screwing up</h2><p>I figured that at the very least I would
    try and offer some words of advice based on the back of what’s happening right
    now:</p><ol><li><p>Don’t bank with HSBC. If you’re about to start a small business,
    think twice. The banking service is perfectly fine, but when something out of
    the ordinary happens they move like dinosaurs.</p></li><li><p>Don’t keep all your
    business funds with the same bank. This one is a lot harder to arrange and can
    complicate your accounting, but I’d say it’s worth the hassle. Make sure you’ve
    enough funds set-aside in an entirely separate account, with an <em>entirely different
    institution</em>, to cover what you need for a month or more. I wish I had.</p></li><li><p>If
    you can pay for an internet service for a year, do so. Most services offer discounts
    if you pre-pay anyway, so it saves money, but it would also protect you against
    temporary payment problems in the future, unless of course you’re incredibly unlucky
    and they land at the same time your yearly payment is due. Our DropBox account
    was paid for the year thankfully, so our files remained intact.</p></li><li><p>If
    you don’t need a service, cancel it, or do it yourself. When everything started
    failing I was surprised to see a couple of subscriptions I had that weren’t even
    needed any longer. The payments were quite tiny but I didn’t need to be spending
    the money at all, so at least I got to cancel those. It’s also made me question
    the need for a couple of services I have that I could spend some time and do myself
    locally (git repo hosting for private projects for a single team is a good example
    of this)</p></li><li><p>Keep control of your DNS with a provider <em>separate
    to your web host</em>. Although it’s a horrendous situation to be in, should you
    be forced into it at least you can update your DNS to point to a new host. This
    isn’t always possible if they manage DNS for you as well, but if your business
    relies on your site for income it’s a safe thing to do.</p></li><li><p>Be able
    to redirect payments to another bank account. This was an absolute life saver
    for me. All of our shop sales are handled via <a href="undefined">Gumroad</a>
    and we were able to change the account they pay in to each week away from the
    business one and into our personal one. It’s going to be a nightmare to unpick
    when this mess is over, but it was that or don’t buy any food. The groceries won.
    We also get money from advertising, affiliates and Patreon into our PayPal account.
    A massive shout-out to PayPal for being so excellent. They were able to issue
    us with a MasterCard (linked to our PayPal balance, not a credit card) and allow
    us to transfer money into our personal account, instead of the business one. This
    was quite literally the only way we managed to pay our mortgage this month. PayPal,
    thank you. Your support was fantastic. I only wish HSBC were more like you.</p></li><li><p>If
    you run a small business ask yourself this: What would happen if your account
    was frozen and you couldn’t access a single penny in it? How would you cope? It’s
    an unusual predicament, but clearly not a rare one.</p></li></ol><h2>What next?</h2><p>I
    really don’t know. Our account is still suspended. HSBC are still a brick wall
    of silence. The only income we have at the moment is from <a href="http://phaser.io/shop">shop
    sales</a>, <a href="https://patreon.com/photonstorm">Patreon</a> and <a href="http://phaser.io/community/donate">donations</a>.
    It’s barely enough to cover our living costs, but thanks to some superb thriftiness
    from my wife, we’re making it work. <em>Just</em>. <strong>We are literally being
    saved by the income from our open source project</strong>, but unless HSBC hurry
    up, it won’t be enough to save my company as well.</p><p>I cannot wait for this
    nightmare to be over. Once it is, I cannot wait to transfer my business away from
    HSBC. Assuming I still have one left to transfer.</p><p>Until then, opening Photoshop
    this morning summed it up well:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*knEUuRcR34K_0AKNuUqtGg.png"
    alt=""></p><h2>Update: 4th September — HSBC just called me!</h2><p>It has been
    an insane few hours since I posted this article. Thank you to everyone who commented
    or retweeted. It has literally exploded on twitter, is the top story on Hacker
    News, etc. I think the injustice of it all struck a chord.</p><p>And, get this...
    <strong>HSBC called me</strong>. A very apologetic lady from their complaints
    department said they hadn’t yet investigated the cause of the account suspension,
    but that it had been removed and everything was running normally now. Even though
    I’ve been telling them for weeks it was a mistake and met a stone-wall at every
    turn. I guess all it took was <em>hundreds of thousands</em> of outraged tweets?</p><p>So
    part of me is incredibly happy this is close to over. The other part of me is
    unbelievably furious it took a social outcry to fix it. The number of companies
    I have heard from who have experienced the <em>exact same thing</em> is staggering.</p><p>To
    those who donated to me — thank you! I will contact you all to offer your donation
    back if you would like it. The purpose of my article was never about making money,
    only about getting my own back again. Please give me a few days to sort this out,
    my inbox has exploded, but at least I can pay the bill for it now. I’ll update
    this article as I learn more from the bank.</p>'

  :title: Before you can master design, you must first master the fundamentals
  :content: "<p>Before you can master design, you must first master the fundamentals</p><p>Last
    week, one of my readers sent in a question: <strong>How do I become a better visual
    designer?</strong></p><p>As I was thinking about how to answer this question,
    my mind wandered to my experience with learning Mandarin Chinese. Recently, I
    decided to teach myself Mandarin. When it comes to learning a new language, you
    first have to start with the fundamentals. Nouns, pronouns, and verbs form the
    basis for conveying more complex ideas.</p><p>Language is a way that people communicate
    concepts to one another. <strong>Visual design is a visual language.</strong>
    And learning visual design is no different from learning a new language.</p><p>*<em>Good
    visual designs aren’t born. They are made. *</em>The key to becoming a better
    visual designer is rigor. You will only improve as a visual designer if you make
    a conscious effort.</p><p>Here are some fundamentals you should master so you
    can take your visual design to the next level.</p><h2>Fundamental #1: Go back
    to the basics with type</h2><p>You can tell a lot about a designer by looking
    at their typography. <strong>This is because type is a fundamental basis for design.</strong></p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*JS9qoaHxjQDrOzMevwT64g.png\"
    alt=\"[Type as imagery](https://dribbble.com/shots/1829402-Discount-Logotype)\"><em><a
    href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/1829402-Discount-Logotype\">Type as imagery</a></em></p><p>You
    can create entire designs with just type. You can also base designs on type, taking
    subtle queues from the fonts that you choose. In order to improve the typography
    in your designs, first start by learning the basics.</p><p>Develop a vocabulary
    for describing type. Learn about what terms like tracking, kerning, and leading
    mean. The article <a href=\"https://designschool.canva.com/blog/typography-terms/\">A
    Beautifully Illustrated Glossary Of Typographic Terms You Should Know</a> is a
    great visual resource for learning those terms.</p><p>Then, if you want a comprehensive
    understanding of how to apply typography to the web, read <a href=\"https://webtypography.net/toc/\">Web
    Typography: The Elements <em>of</em> Typographic Style Applied to the Web</a>.</p><p><img

    alt=\"[Font pairing can make or break a design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/35768979/Typography-Google-Fonts-Combinations)\"><em><a
    href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/35768979/Typography-Google-Fonts-Combinations\">Font
    pairing can make or break a design</a></em></p><p>Finally, learn how to pair fonts
    together. A great resource for this is <a href=\"https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/circular\">FontWolf</a>
    and <a href=\"http://fontpair.co/\">FontPair</a>. Being able to pair fonts together
    will dramatically change the dynamics of your design.</p><p>For a more in depth
    exploration of typography, you can read my article: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JonathanZWhite/typography-can-make-your-design-or-break-it-7be710aadcfe\">Typography
    can make your design… Or break it.</a></p><h2>Fundamental #2: Use space to create
    balance</h2><p>Spacing helps establish vertical and horizontal motion in your
    designs. It’s pivotal for creating visual hierarchy and forming association between
    elements.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Go7ZCGcIMD8t4W-XQ9M8fA.jpeg\"
    alt=\"[Create balance and visual harmony](https://dribbble.com/shots/3318361-Weekly-Mixtape-08-Margin)\"><em><a
    href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/3318361-Weekly-Mixtape-08-Margin\">Create balance
    and visual harmony</a></em></p><p>You can always look at sites like <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/\">Behance</a>
    and <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/\">Dribbble</a> for inspiration on how to space
    elements. But <strong>it’s important to develop your own intuition for using space
    to create balance and visual harmony.</strong></p><p>When studying typography,
    you may have noticed the importance of spacing in type. Adjusting the kerning
    and leading for fonts is a great exercise for developing your eye for spacing.
    For this reason, I recommend you try <a href=\"http://type.method.ac/#\">KernType</a>,
    a game where you compare your kerning solution to a typographer’s solution.</p><p><img

    href=\"http://www.howdesign.com/design-competition-galleries/poster-design-awards/poster-design-winners/\">Simplification
    of award winning poster by Craig Welsh</a></em></p><p>Another exercise that will
    help develop your eye is the following: Take an existing design, draw an x and
    y axis, simplify the design into basic shapes, analyze how the design is balanced,
    and then rearrange the elements. Pay close attention to how negative space affects
    the balance of the elements.</p><h2>Fundamental #3: Use size to establish visual
    hierarchy</h2><p>When it comes to creating visual hierarchy, sizing is second
    to none. <strong>By using size to convey visual relationships between elements,
    you can establish flow.</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3488/1*vzUuGyuZAkjNL01dUxKj0Q.png\"
    alt=\"Sizing is one of the reasons why grids are useful\"><em>Sizing is one of
    the reasons why grids are useful</em></p><p>Sizing is one of the reasons why grids
    are useful. You can use grids to help you size elements using ratios to convey
    importance.</p><p>Once you have determined a size for an element, keep it the
    same across all instances of it. <strong>In design, consistency is king.</strong></p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*De1u6HLHDzrq1Y_uosNguQ.png\"

    href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/2475367-Intercom-s-Developer-Hub\">Use size
    to establish visual hierarchy</a></em></p><h3><strong>Here’s an exercise that
    will help develop your eye for sizing.</strong></h3><p>The key is asking for feedback.</p><p>Sketch
    or wireframe a landing page. Then ask a friend to look at your design. Get them
    to circle the elements that stand out the most. Afterwards, have them number the
    circled elements based on visual weight. Are the results what you expected?</p><p>When
    doing this exercise, keep the following questions in mind:</p><ul><li><p>What
    is the conversion goal of the landing page? How can you optimize to meet your
    goal?</p></li><li><p>What is the relationship between different elements? What
    elements do you want to emphasize?</p></li><li><p>Does your layout successfully
    guide a user’s eye through the page?</p></li></ul><h2>Fundamental #4: Use color
    to convey meaning</h2><p>Color plays many roles. It conveys meaning, creates emotional
    resonance, and brings unity to designs.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*BzRqDemAU1GJnv-IZQ46jQ.png\"
    alt=\"[Color helps convey meaning in design](https://dribbble.com/shots/3302492-Desktop-Search-Results)\"><em><a
    href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/3302492-Desktop-Search-Results\">Color helps
    convey meaning in design</a></em></p><p>For a deep dive into color, you can read
    my article <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/designing-in-color-abd358660a7b\">Designing
    in Color</a>. Here are a few key points from the article.</p><ul><li><p>Identify
    the purpose of your design before choosing a color palette. <strong>Good design
    align its color palette with its purpose.</strong></p></li><li><p>Identify your
    audience. People perceive colors differently. Colors have different effects on
    people based on their personal preference, cultural upbringing, and experiences.</p></li><li><p><strong>When
    choosing a color palette, simplicity is key.</strong> Choose a neutral background
    color. Then choose a primary and secondary accent color. Finally based on your
    other colors, choose an error and success color for your different UI states.</p></li></ul><p>Once
    you have a good grasp on the basics of color theory, color comes down to experimentation
    and iteration. <strong>Actively try break out of your comfort zone and try new
    color palettes.</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/13248/1*mNh06wbZh_pWx55ZHb0C7g.png\"
    alt=\"Movies and shows are a great source of color inspiration\"><em>Movies and
    shows are a great source of color inspiration</em></p><h3><strong>Here’s an exercise
    that will help develop your eye for color.</strong></h3><p>Spend time compiling
    color palettes for things around you like photographs, magazines, and your favorite
    shows. Then take an existing design and apply new color palettes to it.</p><p>Take
    note of how it changes the mood and tone of the design. Does it change the meaning
    as well?</p><p>Treat your work as a craft, in that there is always something that
    you can improve. <strong>Rely on yourself to be the motivation to become a better
    designer.</strong></p><p>What are you strategies for improving as a designer?

    legendary friend David Eric Grohl said about learning new things:</h2><blockquote><p>I
    never took lessons to play the drums. I never took lessons to play the guitar.
    I just sort of figured it out. I think that if you’re passionate about something
    and you’re driven and you’re focused, you can do anything you want to do in life.—
    Dave Grohl, Foo Fighters</p></blockquote><p>With Mr. Grohls words in mind, are
    you ready for your crash course? Buckle up buttercup, here we go in no particular
    order:</p><h2>1. Use plenty of contrast</h2><p>The background and font color should
    be different enough to not cause eyestrain. Typically black text on white backgrounds
    tends to be the most legible. Stay away from the light gray, yellows and greens.
    If you have to squint to read then you know you have a problem.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2068/1*6GMYLFdIiNOGDzS7w1aetg.png"

    Almost Black is easier to read than Black</h2><p>If you have the choice, try using
    the color #333333 RGB (51,51,51) instead of pure black for your text. Pure black
    on white jiggles for the eye and makes the letters hard to focus on.</p><p><img

    Important Content First</h2><p>Layout the most important information first to
    clearly support the primary use case of your app or website. Important content
    should be visible without zooming or scrolling or tapping.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4284/1*4pP1yxz0D-uSp15vD8ogjA.png"

    on the left) puts a clear focus on the photo/video posted by the user.</p><p>Pinterest
    (below, on the right), creates visual hierarchy by pinning their search bar to
    the top followed by their nice grid below. Pinterest is very intentional about
    having their search box as the first item on the page.</p><h2>Search is the core

    and player controls second. Even though the player controls are secondary, Spotify
    gives more weight to the play and pause button over fast forward and reverse.</p><p><strong>Facebook</strong>

    that feels off or janky is to make sure the alignment is not off. When designers
    talk about the need to use a “grid” they are trying to alert the team to the issue
    of mis-alignment.</p><h3>Fixing alignment is one of the easiest improvements we
    can make to any app or website and instantly makes an app or website look 10x

    Use a list view for results, if order is important</h2><p>Most mobile and web
    apps have some type of search and there can be some healthy design debates on
    how to display the results.</p><p><strong>If order is important then a list view

  :title: 10 Small Design Mistakes We Still Make
  :content: '<p>Don’t Make Me Think by Steve Krug</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4800/1*BxGQrGiTgBs8LFhrxW0UYg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The saying that “good design is obvious” is pretty damn old, and
    I am sure it took different shapes in the previous centuries. It referred to good
    food, music, architecture, clothes, philosophy and everything else.</p><p>We forget
    that the human mind changes slowly, and the knowledge you have about human behaviour
    will not go old for at least 50 years or so. To make it easy for you, we need
    to keep consistent with a couple of principles that will remind us of how to design
    great products. We should be told at least once a month about these small principles
    until we live and breathe good design.</p><blockquote><h1>The human brain’s capacity
    doesn’t change from one year to the next, so the insights from studying human
    behaviour have a very long shelf life. What was difficult for user twenty years
    ago continues to be difficult today — J. Nielsen</h1></blockquote><h2>Revisiting:
    Don’t Make Me Think</h2><p>Steve Krug laid out some useful principles back in
    2000, after the dot-com boom which are still valuable and relevant nowadays. Even
    after his revised version, nothing changed. Yes, you will tell me that the looks
    are more modern and the websites are more organised and advanced (no more flash!).
    But what I mean about that is — nothing has changed in human behaviour. We will
    always want the principle “don’t make me think” applied to any type of product
    we interact (whether it is a microwave, tv, smartphone or car).</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4800/1*xWVMBLS8gbe77duA6yjYbw.png"
    alt=""></p><h2>1. We don’t read, we scan</h2><p>The reason for that is — we are
    on a mission, and we only look for the thing that interests us. For example, I
    rarely remember myself going through all the text on the homepage of a product
    website. Why? Because most of the web users are trying to get something done,
    and done quickly. We do not have time to read more than necessary. And we still
    put a lot of text because we think people need to know that. Or as some designers
    say: “it adds to the experience”.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4800/1*maub7jjaZdLjYeCbAfRTQw.png"
    alt=""></p><ul><li><p>*<em>Use plenty of headings — *</em>they tell you what each
    section is about or if they are relevant to the person. Either way, they help
    you decide to scan further or leave the website</p></li><li><p>*<em>Keep paragraphs
    short — *</em>long paragraphs makes it harder for readers to keep their place,
    and they are harder to scan than a series of short paragraphs. There’s always
    a reasonable place in a paragraphs to break it in two.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Use
    bulleted lists — *</em>almost anything can be a bullet list. Do you have a sentence
    that separates many things with comma? Then it can be a bullet list. Also, don’t
    forget to leave space between bullet list rows for optimal reading. Take Medium
    as an example.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Highlight key terms — *</em>much of page scanning
    process consists of looking for keywords and phrases. Formatting the most important
    one in bold, makes them easier to find. Also, don’t highlight too many things
    because it will lose effectiveness.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4800/1*XtLgJ54SiEmZ1juwczJERQ.png"
    alt=""></p><h2>2. Create effective visual hierarchies</h2><p>Another important
    aspect that will help scanning a page is offering a proper visual hierarchy. We
    have to make it clear that the appearance on a page portrays the relationship
    between elements. So there are a couple of principles for that:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The
    more important something is, the more prominent it is.</strong> The most important
    stuff are either larger or bolder in distinctive colour set.</p></li><li><p><strong>Things
    that are related logically, are related visually.</strong> For example things
    are similar by grouping them under the same visual style, or under the same heading.</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4800/1*vePi3S2_iyRU5MKdEbQ_iQ.png" alt=""></p><h2>3.
    Don’t reinvent the wheel</h2><p>We believe that people want something new and
    more. But we forget that there are so many applications on the market that each
    demands our time. Each of them has different interactions, and we need to learn
    each one of them. And our mind blows up when: “Oh man, another app to learn?!”.</p><h3>It
    is an important point to know before I am going to say this:</h3><p>We as designers,
    when asked to design something new, have a temptation to try and reinvent the
    wheel. Because doing something like everyone else seems somehow wrong. We have
    been hired to do something different. Not to mention that the industry rarely
    offers awards and praises for designing something that has “the best use of conventions”.</p><blockquote><h1>Before
    reinventing the wheel, you have to understand the value (time, effort, knowledge)
    that went into what you are trying to disrupt and innovate.</h1></blockquote><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4800/1*TIujSjdfEJN1ZaW1kqxOPg.png" alt=""></p><h2>4.
    Product instructions must die</h2><p>Our job is to make stuff clear and obvious.
    If obvious is not an option, then at least self-explanatory. The main thing you
    need to know about instructions is that nobody is going to read them. We should
    aim for removing the instructions to make everything self-explanatory. But when
    they are necessary, cut as much as possible. (but, really, nobody is going to
    read them). We muddle through.</p><blockquote><h1>If it is not obvious then we
    should aim for self-explanatory.</h1></blockquote><p>Take IKEA as an example.
    If you gave an average person to assemble a wardrobe from IKEA, I am sure that
    he will assemble it right most of the times. Why? It is, most of the cases, apparent
    on how it should be assembled if we have a clear picture in front of us. But even
    in instances where they look at the instructions, there are no words — only images.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4800/1*8jnrHZclLHqmqYRRPrFX2g.png" alt=""></p><h2>5.
    We do not care how your product works</h2><p>For most of the people, it is not
    essential to know or understand how your product works. Not because they are not
    intelligent, but merely because they do not care. <strong>So once they nail down
    the use of your product, they will rarely switch to something else.</strong></p><p>Let’s
    take as an example the Apple AirPods. We can all admit that they are the worst
    sounding earbuds for the price you pay. But when I look at how people interact
    with it, I understand the real reason why they buy it. They do not make you think
    about why it is not working. You even don’t notice they have new technology.</p><p>I
    look at how my mom interacts with them, and she never asked me what technology
    is behind or how they work. She knows that whenever you open the case near your
    device, it is going to connect. It is that easy.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4800/1*l9C6irFunOYMa2cyKsiZBA.png"
    alt=""></p><h2>6. People don’t look for “subtle cues” — we are in a hurry</h2><p>My
    favourite one. We, designers, love giving the users subtle effects and add beautiful
    delights. Right? Well, what if I told you that your users don’t care about it?
    No matter how much they tell you they do, they don’t. First time? Yes. Second?
    Ok. Third? Really, how much do I have to see this until it’s enough?</p><p><strong>Why
    is this happening? Life is a much more stressful and demanding environment than
    an app’s delights and subtle effects.</strong> For example, you are a father,
    and your kid is screaming because he wants ice cream, the dog is barking because
    somebody is calling at the front door and you are trying to book a quick train
    ticket that should leave in 40 minutes. In that specific moment, people will not
    give a f* about your subtle cues. On the other side, we should use them, but not
    when it kills the user flow.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4800/1*OT00lN9EslrHNNTDa2S9fw.png"
    alt=""></p><h2>7. Focus groups are not usability tests</h2><p><strong>Focus group</strong>
    is a small group of people that sit around at the table and discuss things. They
    talk about their opinions about the product, past experiences, their feelings
    and reactions to new concepts. Focus groups are great for determining what your
    audience wants.</p><p><strong>A usability test</strong> is about watching one
    person at a time trying to use something (your product in this case). In this
    case, you ask them to perform specific actions to see if you need to fix something
    in your concepts. So focus groups is about listening and usability tests are about
    watching.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4800/1*25iBSF3Hraqc6Gq1zVmjzQ.png"
    alt=""></p><h2>8. We allow personal feelings take over the process</h2><p>All
    of us who design digital products have the moment when they say — “I am a user
    too, so I know what is good or bad.” And because of that, we tend to have strong
    feelings about what we like and don’t.</p><p><strong>We enjoy using products with
    ___<strong><em>, or we think that _</em></strong>_ is a big pain.</strong> And
    when we work on a team it tends to be hard to check those feelings at the door.
    The result is a room full of people with strong personal feelings on what it takes
    to design a great product. We tend to think that most of the users are like us.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4800/1*8h_P4l40NLn7NU4jV94Gxw.png" alt=""></p><h2>9.
    You ask the wrong questions</h2><p>It is not productive and will not add any value
    if you ask questions such as: “Do people like drop-down menus?”. The right question
    to ask is: “Does this drop-down menu, with these words, in this context, on this
    page create a good experience for people who are likely to use the site?”</p><blockquote><h1><strong>We
    should leave aside “do people like it?” and get deeper into the strategic context
    of design.</strong></h1></blockquote><p>The reason for that is if we focus on
    what people like, we will lose focus and energy. Usability testing will erase
    any “likes” and show you what needs to be done.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4800/1*efRKVxyPN1tG1Jijsnb98A.png"
    alt=""></p><h2>10. When a person uses your product, you forget that she shouldn’t
    spend time thinking about…</h2><ul><li><p>Where am I?</p></li><li><p>Where should
    I begin?</p></li><li><p>Where the f* did they put _____ ?</p></li><li><p>What
    are the most important things on this page?</p></li><li><p>Why did they call it
    that way?</p></li><li><p>Is that an ad or part of the site?</p></li></ul><p>The
    point is that every question that pops into our head, when using your product,
    only adds up to the cognitive workload. It distracts our attention from “why I
    am here” and “what I need to do”. And as a rule, people don’t enjoy solving puzzles
    when they merely want to know if that button is clickable or not.</p><p>And every
    time you make a user tap on something that does not work, or it looks like a button/link
    but it’s not, it also adds up to the pile of questions. And this happens because
    who built the product did not care too much about the product.</p><p>Make sure

  :title: 7 Basic Rules for Button Design
  :content: '<p>7 Basic Rules for Button Design</p><h3>by <a href="http://babich.biz">Nick
    Babich</a></h3><p>Buttons are an essential element of interaction design. They
    have a primary role in the conversation between a user and the system. In this
    article, I’ll review seven basic principles you need to know to create effective
    buttons.</p><h2>1. Make buttons look like buttons</h2><p>When it comes to interacting
    with user interface, users need to know instantly what is ‘clickable’ and what’s
    not. Every item in a design requires effort by the user to decode. Generally,
    the more time needed for users to decode the UI the less usable it becomes for
    them.</p><p>But how do users understand whether a certain element is interactive
    or not? They use previous experience and visual signifiers to clarify the meaning
    of the UI object. That’s why it so important to use appropriate visual signifiers
    (such as size, shape, color, shadow, etc.) to make the element look like a button.
    Visual signifiers hold an essential information value — they help to create *affordances
    *in the interface.</p><p>Unfortunately, in many interfaces the signifiers of interactivity
    are weak and require interaction effort; as a result, they effectively reduce
    discoverability.</p><p>If clear affordances of interaction are missing and users
    struggle with what is “clickable” and what is not, it won’t matter how cool we
    make the design. If they find it hard to use, they will find it frustrating and
    ultimately not very usable.</p><p>Weak signifiers is an even more significant
    problem for mobile users. In the attempt to understand whether an individual element
    is interactive or not, desktop users can move the cursor on the element and check
    whether the cursor changes its state. Mobile users don’t have such opportunity.
    To understand whether an element is interactive or not users have to tap on it
    — there’s no other way to check the interactivity.</p><h3>Don’t assume that something
    in your UI is obvious for your users</h3><p>In many cases, designers intentionally
    don’t identify buttons as interactive elements because they assume the interactive
    elements are obvious for users. When designing an interface, you should always
    keep in mind following rule:</p><blockquote><h1>Your ability to interpret clickability
    signifiers aren’t the same as your users’ because you know what each element in
    your own design is intended to do.</h1></blockquote><h3>Use familiar designs for
    your buttons</h3><p>Here are a few examples of buttons that are familiar to most
    users:</p><ul><li><p>Filled button with square borders</p></li><li><p>Filled button
    with rounded corners</p></li><li><p>Filled button with shadows</p></li><li><p>Ghost
    button</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*UZTsPglcLschWx2IUMt7dg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Among all those examples, the “Filled button with shadows” design
    is the clearest for users. When users see a dimensionality of an object, they
    instantly know that it’s something they can press.</p><h3>Don’t forget about the
    whitespace</h3><p>Not only the visual properties of the button itself are important.
    The amount of whitespace near the button makes it easier (or harder) for users
    to understand whether it’s an interactive element or not. In the example, below
    some users might confuse the ghost button with an information box.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*AqsH5XIqUgL9v0_SWbwgKw.png" alt="As
    a user, you can’t tell whether it’s a box or a button."><em>As a user, you can’t
    tell whether it’s a box or a button.</em></p><h2>2. Put buttons where users expect
    to find them</h2><p>Buttons should be located in places where users can easily
    find them or expect to see. <em>Don’t make users hunt for buttons.</em> If users
    can’t find a button, they won’t know that it exists.</p><h3><strong>Use traditional
    layouts and standard UI patterns as much as possible</strong></h3><p>Conventional
    placement for buttons improves discoverability. With a standard layout, users
    will easily understand the purpose of each element — even it’s a button without
    strong signifiers. Combining a standard layout with clean visual design and ample
    whitespace makes the layout more understandable.</p><blockquote><h1>Don’t play
    hunt-the-button game with your users</h1></blockquote><p><strong>Tip:</strong>
    Test your design on discoverability. When users first navigate to a page that
    contains some actions that you want them to take, it should be easy to spot an
    appropriate button for the user.</p><h2>3. *Label buttons *with what they do</h2><p>Buttons
    with generic or misleading labels can be a huge source of frustrations for your
    users. *Write button labels that clearly explain what each button does. *Ideally,
    the button’s label should clearly describe its action.</p><p>Users should clearly
    understand what happens when they click on a button. Let me give you a simple
    example. Imagine that you accidentally triggered a delete action and now you see
    the following error message.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*r5O0A-xt1rn_WE3evCC8ww.png"
    alt="The vague label ‘OK’ doesn’t say too much about the action button does."><em>The
    vague label ‘OK’ doesn’t say too much about the action button does.</em></p><p>It’s
    not clear what does ‘OK’ and ‘Cancel’ represent in this dialog. Most users will
    ask themselves “What happens when I click on ‘Cancel’?”</p><blockquote><h1>Never
    designed a dialog box or form that consisted solely of the two buttons ‘OK’ and
    ‘Cancel’.</h1></blockquote><p>Instead of using ‘OK’ label it’s better to use ‘Remove.’
    This will make it clear what this button does for the user. Also, if ‘Delete’
    is a potentially dangerous operation, you can use red color to state this fact.</p><p><img

    card’ is colored in red in this interface. Image: <a href="http://ramotion.com/">Ramotion</a></em></p><h2>4.
    Properly size your buttons</h2><p>Button size should reflect the priority of this
    element on the screen. Large button means more important action.</p><h3>Prioritize
    buttons</h3><p>Make the most important button look like it’s the most important
    one. Always try to make the primary action button more prominent. Increase its
    size (by making a button bigger you make it look more important for users) and
    use a contrasting color to capture user attention.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2698/1*VZEHys1AKuFEuMNc67KGGQ.png"

    Business free’ CTA button."><em>Dropbox uses size and color contrast to focus

    finger-friendly for mobile users</h3><p>In many mobile apps, buttons are too small.
    This often leads to the situation when users mistype.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Wk2xGGQgUB3fIerb.png"

    found that averages for finger pads are between 10–14mm and fingertips are 8–10mm.
    This makes 10mm x 10mm a good minimum touch target size.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/NaN/0*E5IKQ8_HH4rweDAu.jpg"
    alt="Image Source: uxmag"><em>Image Source: uxmag</em></p><h2>5. Mind the order</h2><p>The
    order for buttons should reflect the nature of a conversation between the user
    and the system. Ask yourself, what order users expect to have on this screen and
    design accordingly.</p><blockquote><h1>User interface is a conversation with your
    users</h1></blockquote><p>For example, how to order ‘Previous/Next’ buttons in
    pagination? It’s logical that a button that moves you forward should be on the
    right, and a button which moves you backward should be on the left.</p><h2>6.
    Avoid using too many buttons</h2><p>This is a common problem for many apps and
    websites. When you provide too many options, your <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice">users
    end up doing nothing</a>. When designing pages in your app or website, think about
    the most important actions you want your users to take.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2296/0*TWNAmIkpR7SkXtIt.jpg"
    alt="Too many buttons."><em>Too many buttons.</em></p><h2>7. Provide visual or
    audio feedback on interaction</h2><p>When users click or tap on the button, they
    expect that the user interface will respond with appropriate feedback. Based on
    the type of operation, this might be either visual or audio feedback. When users
    don’t have any feedback, they might consider that the system didn’t receive their
    command and will repeat the action. Such behavior often causes multiple unnecessary
    operations.</p><p>Why is this happening? As humans, we expect some feedback after
    we interact with an object. It might be visual, audio or tactile feedback — anything
    that acknowledges the fact that interaction was registered.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ZIZSTlUWe5Vog-jXBiH5og.gif"

    visual feedback that a press has registered. Image: <a href="https://dribbble.com/vadim_gromov">Vadim
    Gromov</a></em></p><p>For some operations, such as downloading, it’s worth not
    only acknowledging user input but also show a current state of the process.</p><p><img

    button translates into the progress indicator to demonstrate the current state
    of the operation. Image: <a href="https://dribbble.com/ColinGarven">Colin Garven</a></em></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Despite
    the fact that buttons are an ordinary element of interaction design, it’s worth
    putting a lot of attention to make this element as good as possible. Button UX
    design should always be about recognition and clarity.</p><p>Thank you!</p><p><em>Follow

  :title: 50 Things You [Probably] Forgot To Design
  :content: "<p>Methodology</p><h2>50 Things You [Probably] Forgot To Design</h2><h3>Every
    PM: “I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed…”</h3><blockquote><p>*<em>Small Favors:
    *</em>If you love this article, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20totally%20forgot%20to%20design%20some%20of%20these.%20Thanks%20for%20the%20reminder%2C%20%40uxpowertools%21%20https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fux-power-tools%2F50-things-you-probably-forgot-to-design-7a288b0ef914\">share
    it with your friends</a>. If you love puppies, rescue one. If you love mayonnaise,
    refrigerate it.</p></blockquote><p>Look, we all forget to design something on
    occasion. That’s totally cool!</p><p>Well, it’s not <em>cool</em>…but like…<strong>it’s
    okay</strong>. It happens. This list will make you better. Or at least more aware.
    Or maybe you just give it a couple claps because you recognize someone spent time
    curating this list and move on with your life. Nbd. I’m all about those claps,
    and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCkvCPvDXk\">that bass</a>. With
    a Meghan Trainor reference in the first paragraph, we’re off to a <strong>roaring
    start</strong>.</p><p>This is just a list of things that you might have forgotten
    to design. When you think about how simple an app like Instagram or Snapchat is,
    it’s easy to overlook just how many screens, states, and <em>stuff</em> goes in
    to making a really awesome user experience.</p><ul><li><p>Login &amp; Signup stuff</p></li><li><p>First

    upset your PM.</p><h2>Login &amp; Signup</h2><h3><strong>1. The Splash Screen</strong></h3><p>The
    screen that shows up when you launch a mobile app, or when you login to a web
    app and everything is loading.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*sEM54vviUonmagIaPNnOdw.png\"

    is important. Don’t forget it.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*8p1bV2jh4O6RMlYtfrI7Gg.gif\"

    The Welcome Email</strong></h3><p>This straddles the line between product design
    and product marketing, but it’s literally THE FIRST impression you get to have
    on your users. Make it count. It’s a great time to introduce the quippy tone of
    your product.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*zhzAm22XWS6rEj5PiUBr-Q.png\"

    The Out-of-the-Box Empty State(s)</h3><p>It’s like moving into a house and you
    haven’t moved in any furniture. Looks pretty empty, huh? Help your users out by
    giving them a nudge in the right direction. <strong>“Place couch here.”</strong></p><p><img

    a big company, there’s probably a whole team dedicated to this. But they’re still
    gonna bug you for illustrations and screenshots. This deserves as much (or more)
    effort as the login page or the activity feed.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*pIj8Gp5sgWa6PYYUDbkjnQ.png\"

    social accounts or services like Gravatar have really helped us show off our smiling
    faces, but you’re still gonna get <strong><em>that one guy</em></strong> who never
    gets around to uploading a profile photo. Give it a little flair and show off

    you DO have to allow users to leave. Just pretend they’re using your app in a
    public library and they need to logout so some stranger doesn’t change their account
    name to “Mr. Butts”. Inappropriate.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ZxShodBUnhn7M5jdI6R8Ng.png\"

    The App Footer</h3><p>Most of the time I assume pages just go on forever, like
    when people believed the world was flat and just kind of kept going. Note: The
    Earth is not flat.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XqAKqa0-ozKIZ3UhYKuzww.png\"

    The Browser Favicon</h3><p>You know…that little icon that shows up on a browser
    tab. I keep losing my <a href=\"undefined\">Medium</a> tabs because it’s not green
    anymore. But it <strong>is</strong> pretty!</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*z5nSSBgY_U6yw-sEPEEOJA.png\"

    Input States</h3><p>Ugh, so many states. “Focus + Hover” might be my favorite/most
    obscure. The screenshot below comes from the <a href=\"http://uxpower.tools/\">UX
    Power Tools Design System</a>.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3412/1*IGYztTe-inWGqaqko6a-zg.png\"

    for them, and all they have…</em>uxpower.tools</a></p><h3>15. The <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_tabindex.asp\">Tab
    Order</a></h3><p>Tab Order is an accessibility feature that allows users to navigate
    a page using the Tab key. I couldn’t find an image to represent this, so I took
    a screenshot of a spec <a href=\"undefined\">Christian Beck</a> wrote from 2007
    where he defined tab order position in a table for each UI control in a table
    (I got tired even just writing that \U0001F634…<strong>SnoozeFest 2017™</strong>).
    You can actually define the order in which items are visited to ensure primary
    actions come before secondary ones. This is a neat design challenge.</p><p><img

    on folks. It’s not rocket surgery.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3596/1*q70uY0MvGLyCQsFu7bIU_w.png\"

    should have a pointer. Non-interactive stuff should have a default cursor. Text
    should have a text cursor. Developers don’t always know this. I just redlined
    an app screen the other day where a developer had a text cursor for the hover
    state of a button. <strong>Mercy</strong>.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*UR-BfhvP6gTJJOwNvgnbzQ.png\"

    curtain, and sometimes it’s nice to know when things finish successfully (or don’t).

    The Empty Autocomplete Dropdown</h3><p>Autocomplete is awesome for helping you
    find objects in the system, but sometimes there aren’t any results. In this case,
    you don’t just want an empty box. Show a little message, or allow them to take

    people will probably be Tindering on their phones while the page loads, but in
    the event they actually look up from their sexy swiping, there should probably

    Images</h3><p>Also don’t forget, they’ll probably want to make the website look
    like Stripe so just copy this exactly:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4532/1*XwZWcO-QvdbJnXrjqjJPPA.png\"

    good if you handle the one above. But in this case you’ll probably need to scrub
    content to match the brand of whatever 6-figure deal your brilliant sales team
    is working on.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*mJ5wwxjdCfizyfo-QofhZg.png\"

    Deck image but a little more <em>visionary</em>. I mean…you’re trying to raise
    money. You’ll figure how to make it possible <strong>later</strong>.</p><p><img

    Notification Preferences</h3><p>It’s awesome when apps notify you when things
    happen, and even cooler when it plays a trumpet sound. But after the 19th time,
    you get <em>really tired of trumpets</em>. You should probably let the user decide
    when the trumpets sound.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4076/1*VJ1FjSsnhuZQ7sF7JYud3w.png\"

    paying you thousands of dollars for. And <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cmbeck_\">some

    The “Delete My Account” Option</h3><p>Right, I know. Nobody will do this. But
    hey, maybe they’ll start a new account again someday! Just like the people who
    pass a kiosk in the mall and say “I’ll come back later and buy three!” <strong>Sure.</strong></p><p>There
    are legit reasons for this that <em>are</em> positive. I’ve deleted accounts as
    I merged into a larger team license. I’ve deleted old accounts that collected
    dust and I wanted to start fresh. In any case, it’s good customer service to make
    this a good experience as well.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2344/1*vLMznLG_Adlio9VSR02_Rg.png\"

    my mind how difficult this is for many SaaS products. Shut up and take my money.
    Shouldn’t this be <strong>easy</strong>?! Like…THE EASIEST?!</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2576/1*8uMz0241owLA_0sEn97JpQ.png\"

    you’ll have finished all the previous things and think you’re home free — then
    you literally start to go home for the day proud of how on the ball you are.</p><p>Then
    halfway home on your fixie, sipping kombucha from your camelbak, you remember
    development hasn’t actually started yet! #$%@</p><p>Once development starts, you’ll
    start realizing that just mocking up one screen doesn’t really tell the story
    (it’s cool, we all try to be lazy). Developers need you to actually break down
    how a user experience flows from screen-to-screen.</p><h3>41. The “Change My Address”
    Flow</h3><p>You know when you get a snazzy new apartment downtown and you have
    to change your address on EVERY CREDIT CARD YOU’VE EVER OWNED?</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*xJ2VXYUcM2C5F0DTGqu1cw.png\"

    The “Add A Credit Card” Flow</h3><p>Some people (ahem, me) like to keep like a
    hundred credit/debit cards on file so that thieves have lots of accounts to choose
    from. So make it easy to add cards. That’s really all I have to say about that.</p><p><img

    The “Create a Custom Filter” Flow</h3><p>If you allow for sophisticated filtering,

    That way you don’t have to click a million times all over again.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*8AJ47Nu_FnTszjLso6vAbw.png\"

    is kind of like “Duplicate + Edit” all in one action. Basically the user is able
    to start from an existing object and update it as needed.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2828/1*VKQLwRHbhu6OmQKHqcvd9g.png\"

    forgot about these myself. Look, I love animations but I’m lucky if we have the
    luxury to build these when sales wants a prototype done <strong>yesterday</strong>,
    and development is pointing out something I completely missed in my 8th iteration
    of the landing page. And honestly if we get to animations at all, I just peruse
    Dribbble or CodePen and send something I like to dev and say, “Make it like that!”

  :title: The Ideal Design Workflow
  :content: <p>As designers, we are constantly experimenting with tools and processes
    in an attempt to find the one that works best. After a great deal of experimentation,
    I’ve discovered the perfect design workflow, and I’m going to share it with you
    now. Design is a process and the process I’m going to share is the one I’ve used
    on all my projects to build habit-forming products that people love.</p><p><strong>1.)</strong>
    Sketching (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper">paper</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen">pen</a>)
    — every great design begins on paper. Get out that paper and pen and start drawing
    some shapes.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*KJ0HplGCIcUkzVJqWhujyg.jpeg"
    alt=".&gt;Flawless."><em>.&gt;Flawless.</em></p><p><strong>2.)</strong> Your next
    step is to take photos of your sketches on your smart phone and throw those babies
    into <a href="https://popapp.in/">POP</a> so you can test your prototype.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2150/1*K6rMhNwPzntbu7Vd0p9aMg.gif" alt=""></p><p><strong>3.)</strong>
    Your next step is to make wireframes. Having sketches is never enough. Wireframes
    are a must 100% of the time. There is simply no way around it. Go ahead and open
    <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle">Omnigraffle</a> and make your
    wires.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2330/1*3v-HCiW7uZoej6s_F_q1Rw.png"
    alt=""></p><p><strong>4.)</strong> Now realize you need a dropdown menu so re-do
    those wires in <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*xJRjDTyhxjVZeQ0PG_woeA.jpeg"
    alt="Good when designing for 3rd graders."><em>Good when designing for 3rd graders.</em></p><p><strong>5.)</strong>
    Next, realize you f***ing hate Balsamiq and redo them in <a href="http://www.axure.com/">Axure</a>.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*PNBMvQPZlt_fM0b0sN3DNg.gif" alt=""></p><p><strong>6.)</strong>
    Next, realize you f***ing hate Axure so switch over to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html?sdid=KKQML&mv=search&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!81143510076!e!!g!!illustrator&ef_id=VhwgAgAABQ3p7PI3:20160601232231:s">Adobe

    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2880/1*KYIUa-tO8Iei52_uix3NGg.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>7.)</strong>
    Now export those wires to PNGs and import them into <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a>
    so you can share them with your team.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*X5THTg-vfFJUQy9v1okOZw.png"

    bowl of <a href="http://postfoods.com/our-brands/honey-bunches-of-oats">Honey

    alt=""></p><p><strong>10.)</strong> Redo your prototype in <a href="https://marvelapp.com/">Marvel</a>
    and hope that Jonathan can’t figure out how to leave comments on Marvel.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Aqs5vREj0YFnwANdS0YrCA.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>11.)</strong>
    You succeeded. Wireframes are finally approved. No thanks to Jonathan. Time to
    start working on a higher fidelity prototype.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*w0T8CIBpQnSNdbkflPEb7w.gif"
    alt=""></p><p><strong>12.)</strong> Grab the same stock photos that everyone else
    uses and then use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?sdid=KKQIN&mv=search&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!111672144258!e!!g!!photoshop&ef_id=VhwgAgAABQ3p7PI3:20160601232342:s">Photoshop</a>

    alt="Looks pretty optimized."><em>Looks pretty optimized.</em></p><p><strong>13.)</strong>
    Now, open up <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a> and start creating
    the UI for your app. It’s starting to look like a real product now!</p><p><img

  :title: 2019 UI and UX Design Trends
  :content: "<p>Scenery Illustration by J.HUA</p><p>Last year we put together a prediction
    of mobile UI design <a href=\"https://uxplanet.org/mobile-ui-design-trends-in-2018-ccd26031dfd8\">trends</a>.
    This year, we’re going deeper and beyond just mobile. Because the number one trend
    in modern design is context. There are no generalizations anymore. Everything
    is in context and connected.</p><blockquote><h1><em>It feels like we’re getting
    somewhere with all the tools, advancements in technology, and growth of our understanding
    of how user-facing products really have to work.</em></h1></blockquote><p>Sooner
    than later, we’ll develop the mindset for universal design that encompasses everything
    we produce, and not just sell. The way we do things for ourselves needs better
    design choices. The way we even sound as nations can be designed in a better way.
    Still, a far cry from where we could be in the future, let’s get into the interface
    and experience design trends of 2019.</p><p>Traditionally, we’ll put a fly in
    the ointment of every trend as a reminder to keep tabs on things to avoid abuse.</p><h2>Mighty
    browsers</h2><p>A browser is not only the internet’s vehicle, but it is also a
    means to deliver impact. Browsers are getting faster, more powerful, and attractive.</p><ul><li><p>Browser
    benchmarks and performance tests <a href=\"https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10803-best-windows-10-browser.html\">prove</a>
    significant performance boosts for most popular browsers.</p></li><li><p>Increases
    in speed due to <a href=\"https://www.neowin.net/news/firefox-58-gets-speed-boost-with-streaming-compilation\">streaming
    compilation</a> impact design big time. Mozilla reports the new compiler to be
    10–15 times faster than the previous optimizing compiler.</p></li><li><p>All modern
    browsers support WebGL 2 which <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API\">allows</a>
    for a whole new level of 3D texture and object rendering, fragment depth, and
    vertex array objects.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Web and mobile browser capabilities
    are bridging the gap between conceptual design and reality.</em></h1></blockquote></li></ul><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4000/0*hCnqWmo21cLCfHEO.jpg\" alt=\"Too
    bad [evolutionoftheweb.com](http://evolutionoftheweb.com/) stopped at 2012. This
    chart is gnarly\"><em>Too bad <a href=\"http://evolutionoftheweb.com/\">evolutionoftheweb.com</a>
    stopped at 2012. This chart is gnarly</em></p><h3>\U0001F611</h3><p>Yeah, but
    all the advancements in browsers still promote their separate value without impacting
    the industry on a higher level. Because so much is going on on the web it’s hard
    for browser developers to come up with universal solutions and clean up the internet.</p><p>Browsers
    might be awesome but if they access poor websites, they become contaminated with
    bad UX. We have to force better design choices to unfold the current potential
    of web browsers.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Most websites make browsers look like
    shitty software.</em></h1></blockquote><h2>Purposeful animation</h2><p>Among everything,
    new browser capabilities opened the door for animation. Not just as the motion
    of elements, but a legit design opportunity. The discipline known as <em>motion
    design</em> involves a lot of design aspects but intersects with psychology and
    biology.</p><p>We see this field of knowledge being explored even deeper in 2019.
    Complexity replaces fad as the main characteristic feature of animation in design.
    Motion and transitions convey a lot of information that otherwise would be lost.</p><blockquote><h1><em>The
    estate between screens used to be a no-man’s land. Now it’s your backyard.</em></h1></blockquote><p><img

    Rynzhuk</a></strong></p><p>Engaging a customer on a deeper level means staying
    with them every second of the interaction and making every second count. Designers
    are grasping this opportunity before it gets poisoned by blunt marketing.</p><p>Motion
    design also reaches beyond just presentation and gap filling. It is now an embedded
    part of branding. Still, logos are totems. It’s our imagination and experience
    that revive them. Why not tap into that imagination and ensure it steers the right
    way?</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*NxvShBIKsmyFVN-K.gif\"

    you haven’t thought what your logo consists of, how it feels, tastes, smells,
    and sounds, it’s about time to do that.</em></h1></blockquote><p>Motion speaks
    better than lighting, positioning, and materials. Motion tells a story. If you
    can make your logomark part of your story by putting in some extra thought, I
    say go for it.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*_HtgB_7Akt-zj-Uu.gif\"
    alt=\"Lakko — Logo animation by [Zlatko Kelemenić](https://dribbble.com/StudioMagus)\"><em>Lakko
    — Logo animation by <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/StudioMagus\">Zlatko Kelemenić</a></em></p><h3>\U0001F611</h3><p>Yeah,
    but there is a context for everything including animation. What you see as a designer
    is not what a customer sees as a… customer. If the product we are designing for
    is an actionable one or is connected to dire scenarios, we can’t afford animations
    even if they are meaningful. If there is an emotional contradiction, always go
    neutral.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Don’t animate with reckless abandon.</em></h1></blockquote><h2>3D
    in interfaces and deep flat</h2><p>3D rendering and CG augmentation of real footage
    and imagery have been around for some time. For the sake of speed and performance,
    and also accessibility, designers have a history of avoiding complex 3D models
    in UIs. Better browsers turned this luxury into an affordable feature. Highly
    Complex VFX or Visual Effects take movie-like scenes into the realm of websites.</p><blockquote><h1><em>3D
    graphics in interfaces blend the edge of reality and digital animation.</em></h1></blockquote><p>This
    trend will be specifically useful for product companies with complex processes
    that are not very visual. By using the 3D visualization, you can tap into any
    technological process and create a deeper level of understanding.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4000/0*n1LpLE067hvNWlUY.jpg\"

    Hughes Digital by <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/Rockletdesign\">Sanu Sagar</a></em></p><p>The
    reason this works in movies and video games is the short time these images are
    being displayed for. They call for a superficial impression, not diligent study.
    Combined with purposeful animation, 3D becomes a powerful design tool.</p><p>The
    mobile industry with new powerful chips made it possible to not only render 3D
    objects but use them within the interface. Smaller screens are perfect for that.</p><p><img

    UI design has been a dominant trend for over 5 years and hasn’t really changed.
    Lately, we’ve witnessed a clear shift towards adding depth and dimension to flat
    design without changing its main idea. Why depth is necessary is also why flat
    design came to exist — we need symbolism to make sense of everything. Flat is
    symbolic to the core.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Deep flat is the new flat.</em></h1></blockquote><p>Real
    3D and CG combo revealed a customer response to life-like objects that they can
    interact with. Flat design is also capable of doing that in a unique and yet-to-be-explored
    way. They call it pseudo 3D. It’s flat layers stacking up to create a three-dimensional
    feel. The main asset adding dimension to flat design will be shadow and light
    positioning, and reflections.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*2UsEqZA92T2XmPvG.jpg\"

    | <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/creativemints\">Creative Mints</a></em></p><p>There
    is also a fake 3D trend on the rise which uses conventional design tools like
    Principle and After Effects to create motion pattern emulating 3D.</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*k9mDjIYTRYzKDOaB.gif\" alt=\"Astronaut
    by [Markus Magnusson](https://dribbble.com/MarkusM)\"><em>Astronaut by <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/MarkusM\">Markus
    Magnusson</a></em></p><p>In 2019 we might even see the return of skeuomorphism
    in a new fashion. If flat can be deep, it can be isometric as well. Retaining
    flat symbolism while tapping into a realistic view is a trend to explore.</p><h3>\U0001F611</h3><p>Yeah,
    but we will eventually run out of options. Already, there is no certain direction
    3D UIs are moving towards. It goes both ways — simplification and sophistication.
    While it takes more technological effort to impress us, it takes just as much
    courage to throw complexity out of the window and roll out a crazy concept. However,
    if the most complex interfaces lack meaning or the boldest ideas are nothing but
    a curtain wall, all the efforts will be useless.</p><blockquote><h1><em>We can
    do impressive imagery. It’s time to fill it with sense for humanity and address
    deeper issues. How can we make this happen?</em></h1></blockquote><h2>Surreal
    design</h2><p>All the 3D and motion design opportunities brought by better technologies
    don’t mean a thing if they fail to make an emotional impact. Ironically, you don’t
    need complexity to make the most impact. The reason why renegade attitude has
    always been a satellite of mainstream trends is its natural appeal.</p><blockquote><h1><em>We
    need something to balance out the common sense, we need a devil on our shoulder,
    and sometimes we are playful.</em></h1></blockquote><p>Some of the biggest redesign
    campaigns and associated illustrations came out as playful as it gets:</p><p><img

    href=\"https://dribbble.com/Mailchimp\">Mailchimp</a></em></p><p>This cartoonish
    style of illustration and even UI has one purpose — maintain freshness of the
    look. When your brand name is a staple, you can surround it with a never-ending
    buzz. Doesn’t matter who this style speaks to, it has to be weird or even ugly.
    Expect to see more of that vanguard and surreal design in 2019.</p><h3>\U0001F611</h3><p>Yeah,
    but not all companies and products can afford this impudence. The wider the audience,
    the more neutral the design has to be. Even though this might work for established
    brands, smaller companies and the ones struggling with exposure will have to play
    it safe and stick to commonalities.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Build a following first,
    and then take them for a ride.</em></h1></blockquote><h2>Gradient 2.0, blazing
    colors, and darkness</h2><p>New screens have a fantastic rendition of colors.
    They even have to show this through default wallpapers. Designers explore the
    boundaries of accessibility and impressive gradients in UIs.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Gradients
    are no longer for attention, they are now bringing depth and dimension to the
    interface.</em></h1></blockquote><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*JmhptHo0Lkx4MwjF.png\"

    2.0 by <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/lobanovskiy\">Eddie Lobanovskiy</a></em></p><p>Gradient
    2.0 is subtle and simple. It uses no conflicting colors. It has a clear light
    source and it aligns with the shapes to bring depth.</p><p>Vibrant colors aren’t
    going anywhere. We will see more combined colors and layers. In fact, even the
    monochrome palette will present some sort of visual aesthetic through depth and
    dimensioning.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*LfKYmEypV6WTnHK2.png\"

    is the fact that vibrant colors and meaningful gradients stand out better in the

    href=\"https://shakuro.com/blog/in-the-dead-of-night-why-we-are-drawn-to-dark-interfaces/\">Here</a>,
    we took an anthropological approach to figuring out dark themes and why they work.
    Those who can find the balance between the accessibility of dark UI and emotive
    response of glaring colors, will be on top next year.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Deep

    alt=\"Dashboard by [uixNinja](https://dribbble.com/uixninja)\"><em>Dashboard by

    but accessibility is not the only problem with gradients, colors, and dark themes.
    Bright colors are traditionally used to enforce accents. When everything is color,
    how can you emphasize? Not all users have access to OLED screens. Some of the
    gradients can be lost. Too much contrast can impede user’s focus. Dark themes
    don’t work on a sunny day outside. That might actually be a good thing though.</p><h2>Variable
    fonts</h2><p>Traditionally, typefaces are perceived as static entities with a
    limited set of adjustable parameters. Designers and writers have to consider legibility
    in the context of x-height, stroke and letter width.</p><p>Whenever the design
    requires multiple typefaces, designers have to provide all the files for the font
    styles used. You can’t fully commit to rich typography in a product unless you
    cover all the bases. With variable fonts you just need one file because variable
    or generative fonts provide infinite number of letter weight and width adjustments.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Variable
    fonts can cover any portion of the design space left for the text.</em></h1></blockquote><p><img

    Visions](https://www.readvisions.com/marvin)\"><em><a href=\"https://www.readvisions.com/marvin\">Marvin
    Visions</a></em></p><p>Variable fonts thrive in responsive design and localization.
    In the places where designers had to rack their brains about fitting text into
    smaller screens without losing the zest or stretching it for a different language
    which utilizes less characters.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*HQffX5GgT1z93wj2.gif\"
    alt=\"VOTE by [Josh Rinard](https://dribbble.com/joshuarinard)\"><em>VOTE by <a
    href=\"https://dribbble.com/joshuarinard\">Josh Rinard</a></em></p><p>When web
    fonts were introduced, responsiveness was an aspect they were lacking. Not enough
    flexibility resulted in legibility issues and misalignment of the design itself.
    Variable fonts are fairly recent and they help deliver fonts for the web faster
    and help streamline design process in general.</p><blockquote><h1><em>And that’s
    just the beginning. The artistic options of variable fonts are yet to be explored
    in 2019.</em></h1></blockquote><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2064/0*tipXZ3C4MNJVAixs.gif\"
    alt=\"[Typography.Guru](https://typography.guru/discover/6/)\"><em><a href=\"https://typography.guru/discover/6/\">Typography.Guru</a></em></p><h3>\U0001F611</h3><p>Yeah,
    but how long till a smart and adjustable font becomes a means of promoting a sell?
    If you can have your text replying to the subtleties of every digital context
    available, how does it protect a reader from manipulation? Parametric text has
    roots in book printing which is a context limited by objective physics. This prevented
    people from saving on paper and ink and also made <a href=\"https://shakuro.com/blog/from-seminal-writing-to-dark-patterns-and-back/\">reading</a>
    one of the most important reasons for our progress.</p><h2>Figma</h2><p>Today
    we ask the age-old question: “do designers need to code?” And then, “do developers
    need UX knowledge?” The point of these is simple — avoid pain and discrepancy
    implementing the design. So if it’s about the purpose, it should also be about
    ways to get there.</p><p>Learning to code is a logical option. If you are the
    one who executes your own design, you avoid a bunch of issues. However, the amount
    of knowledge you need to maintain to be a relevant designer and a potent developer
    is exceptional. Can you do it? Good for you. For those who can’t, there should
    be other options.</p><blockquote><h1><em>The purpose is not breeding a universal
    designer. It is about building better products, with delight.</em></h1></blockquote><p>Another
    way to achieve this goal is to use and promote better tools. Figma is one of those
    tools. Before, designers had to consider a lot of variables like operating systems,
    integrations, plugins, storages, synchronization, collaboration, and finally,
    ways to assemble them all in one place. Those who did develop a workflow, deserve
    all kinds of respect. But we want less stress.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*44tVvBVgOYQRSc2m.png\"
    alt=\"Totally switched to Figma by [Alexey Kolpikov](https://dribbble.com/despoth)\"><em>Totally
    switched to Figma by <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/despoth\">Alexey Kolpikov</a></em></p><p>Figma
    is a for-us-by-us design tool. It anticipated a lot of what-ifs and stuffed a
    lot of skepticism.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Figma destroyed Sketch.</em></h1></blockquote><p>It
    does everything Sketch and Adobe XD does but more and better. More importantly,
    Figma is aimed at building what will be implemented. Every Figma component can
    be turned into a React component via API and implemented on the front end. So
    far, Figma beats competition in cost, performance speed, collaboration, sharing,
    embedding, support, and so on. With that said, Figma is still developing and in
    2019, there’s more to come.</p><h3>\U0001F611</h3><p>Yeah, but whenever we develop
    better products and fail to establish ethical use of the above, we only contribute
    to our own demise. Look at Twitter that is <a href=\"https://medium.com/@monteiro/jack-dorseys-resignation-letter-to-twitter-b04e8a63b0a9\">struggling</a>
    to gain back its good name. 2018 was <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/senate-judiciary-hearing-tech-executives-russia-campaign\">fruitful</a>
    in tech executives testifying in court. Turns out, it’s not enough to put tools
    out there, we also have to watch how people use them. Will Figma protect users
    from dark patterns in UX, bad design, and fake news?</p><h2>Voice UIs</h2><p>Design
    does not have to be visual or visible to work. Through bumps and bruises, we realized
    that tools don’t really matter if we are building experiences that are not tactile.
    Designing logic means operating psychology. Building voice controls means dealing
    with natural language processing.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Voice UI is as sensual
    as it is sophisticated.</em></h1></blockquote><p>Voice UI realizes the concept
    of no UI to its finest. The process is internal and has more to do with writing,
    building context, and synthesizing data, than with actual design. Even so, designers
    are obsessed with finding ways to represent voice UI. Mainly it comes through
    impressive minority-report-like interfaces and animations.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*PwvShj4BDS6k-q5D.gif\"
    alt=\"Organic Artificial Intelligence design by [Gleb Kuznetsov](https://dribbble.com/glebich)\"><em>Organic
    Artificial Intelligence design by <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/glebich\">Gleb
    Kuznetsov</a></em></p><p>Most of the times they have nothing in common with the
    reality of voice interfaces but they prepare a user for the absence of controls
    and teach them how to treat technology that does not need any.</p><p>In 2019,
    we can hope to witness the deepening of the voice UI knowledge as more designers
    transition to meaningful experience from plain visual aesthetic of design.</p><h3>\U0001F611</h3><p>Yeah,
    but the biggest challenge with voice UIs is, ironically, not the human-to-machine
    interaction, but the human-to-human one, mediated by technology that has to be
    smarter than the two. We live in a massively imbalanced global society. We are
    struggling with the understanding of one another on many terms, technology included.
    Voice-controlled phones, cars, and homes might just broaden the gap between us.</p><p>As
    designers, we should always consider well-being of humanity as our top priority.
    If technology, even the beautifully designed one, serves some at the expense of
    the others, it has to be tackled relentlessly. That’s not happening.</p><h2>UX
    Writing &amp; UX Editing</h2><p>Last year, designers started paying attention
    to the meaning of the words that bear typefaces. Fiction and tech writers, epistolary
    hobbyists, and journalists got an adjacent industry for their skills. One thing
    led to the other and we defined the role of writing in design:</p><blockquote><h1><em>You
    have to be in control of the way your business talks to your customers.</em></h1></blockquote><p>Before,
    there was a mix of pompous narcissistic bullshit and technical nomenclature. Things
    a business was doing was mistaken for the value it could give its customers. Even
    though businesses were great, they suffered from the lack of definitive, simple,
    and persuasive wording to use with their audience.</p><p>UX writing is based on
    two simple principles: be respectful and be useful. Everything else stems from
    them. Being concise means respecting people enough to value their time more than
    yours. It’s you who has to die over the text, not the user. Being clear means
    avoiding being twofold, protecting from bad experiences, thus, being useful. Being
    expressive means being truthful and hiding no flaws. Always focus on helping a
    user first, don’t show off your eloquence, don’t SEO it, and never use marketing
    cliches — enough is enough.</p><blockquote><h1><em>UX writing is easy once you
    embrace being respectful and useful.</em></h1></blockquote><p>People don’t want
    to see you flex and promote yourself. They want to know if you can help them.
    Make your service do the talking.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*YX4RGhWILRym65KQ.gif\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>In 2018, we’ve witnessed a noticeable rise in voice and tone design
    in major companies. They stopped pursuing ingenuity and focused on customer value.
    In 2019 we are yet to see the development of UX editing is a design discipline.</p><p>The
    difference between UX writing and UX editing is the bandwidth. UX writers produce
    user-facing text. UX editors analyze, morph, bend, and twist any copy to turn
    it into a simple humane text. There is no crash course for UX editing. It is experience,
    observation, and kindness.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Every major redesign campaign
    in 2019 will require a UX editor.</em></h1></blockquote><h3>\U0001F611</h3><p>Yeah
    but every trend goes through a set of stages. The first one is skepticism, then
    fascination, and then, bore. Fascination is the most dangerous because it often
    gets out of hand. It can turn the idea into a caricature and distort the value.
    UX writing is no different. When being simple is mistaken for dumbing down. When
    being clear becomes impudence, and being persuasive turns into condescendence.</p><p>There
    is still a place for creative writing in product design. But not where the product
    meets a user. For example, Nike and Boeing are <a href=\"https://medium.com/s/thenewnew/nike-and-boeing-are-paying-sci-fi-writers-to-predict-their-futures-fdc4b6165fa4\">paying</a>
    sci-fi writers to predict their futures.</p><h2>Product designer as a job title</h2><p>UX
    design is a very broad term. It is a part of service design which is cross-industrial.
    As the result, designers and design firms gather extensive portfolios of projects
    ranging from simple utility apps to complex FinTech platforms.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Service
    design is a blanket. It can cover every industry and apply what works universally.</em></h1></blockquote><p>Service
    designers can have their own style which they can apply to any product. That’s
    what they get famous for and that’s what businesses are willing to pay for. It’s
    like buying parts from a respected supplier.</p><p>However, most companies are
    product companies and they might require a deeper level of understanding from
    a designer. These companies require a product designer who is integrated deeply
    into the team, has all the data available, and all the tools to influence the
    system as a whole.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Product design has a significant advantage
    over service design. That’s the access to the analytics and the ability to test
    design decisions live.</em></h1></blockquote><p>Product designers have the ability
    to focus on the specifics of the product they are associated with and let go of
    everything else. They are deeply informed about the user demographic they are
    designing for and have real data to operate on, as opposed to the assumptions
    most service designers have to work with.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*ibNtw3YhI32PTlQ3.png\"
    alt=\"Innovative Eye Pillow Landing Page Design by [Sasha Turischev](https://dribbble.com/turischev)\"><em>Innovative
    Eye Pillow Landing Page Design by <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/turischev\">Sasha
    Turischev</a></em></p><h3>\U0001F611</h3><p>Yeah, but transitioning to product
    design requires vigor. By risking to immerse yourself with a certain industry
    or a product, we are making a choice that we might never return from. In that
    case, the decision has to be factored. We have to consider the viability of the
    industry and the perspectives of the professional development within it.</p><p>Fortune
    favors the brave and in 2019, we’ll see even more dedicated designers taking a
    shot at becoming specialists and sacrificing their universal skills. Time will
    tell.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Finally, the greatest trend we are starting to notice
    is a gradual shift towards sincerity. There’s only so much trickery you can resort
    to. Nothing beats good intent and design has good intent in its core.</em></h1></blockquote><iframe

  :content: '<p>Complexion Reduction: A New Trend In Mobile Design</p><p>by <a href="http://www.themikehorton.com">Michael
    Horton</a> | Co-Founder &amp; Head of Product at <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fontmoji/id1298271603?mt=8">Fontmoji</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>NOTE:</strong>
    <em>Thanks for all the positive feedback on this article. This is now one of the
    most read design articles on Medium and has been reposted in <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3061616/app-uis-are-all-starting-to-look-the-same-thats-not-a-bad-thing">Fast
    Co Design</a>, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/complexion-reduction-a-new-trend-in-mobile-design_us_577d828fe4b05b4c02fb8b07">the
    Huffington Post</a> and dozens of other awesome publications!</em></p></blockquote><iframe
    src="https://medium.com/media/23ce1875530ef377a2c45d771f32dfd2" frameborder=0></iframe><p><strong><em>We
    have been living in a world of ‘clean and minimal’ for quite some time, so what’s
    next?</em></strong></p><p>Over the last several months, some of the leaders of
    innovative design have taken ‘minimal design’ to the next level. Facebook, Airbnb
    and Apple have followed a similar blueprint to simplify prominent products in
    a way that reflects this new trend of ‘Complexion Reduction’ in mobile design.</p><h3>WHAT
    THE HELL IS COMPLEXION REDUCTION?</h3><p>You’ve never heard of ‘Complexion Reduction’
    you say? Well yea, that’s because I just made the term up. Recently I’ve noticed
    a new trend that is beyond flat design, beyond minimal design and independent
    of <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/progressive-content/">progressive
    reduction</a>. Some may claim that this is just the next step of minimal design
    being implemented into the mobile realm but I say it is something more distinct.
    There are specific similarities and characteristics that define this new trend.
    So I decided to name it. I’m allowed to do that, right?</p><p><strong>The defining
    characteristics of this <em>hot new trend</em> sweeping across Silicon Valley
    are:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Bigger, bolder headlines</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Simpler
    more universal icons</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Extraction of color</strong></p></li></ol><p>The
    result? The user interfaces of some of our favorite apps are starting to look
    more and more like they could all be housed under the same brand.</p><h3>THE PROOF</h3><p>I
    first started taking notice of this trend back in early May when *<em>Instagram
    *</em>released their <a href="https://medium.com/@ianspalter/designing-a-new-look-for-instagram-inspired-by-the-community-84530eb355e3#.gmyokj9qa">redesigned
    UI</a>.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*36N2-AkO-a6WLwh-5W0EmQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Some of the changes they introduced included removing much of the
    blue and dark grey color used throughout the app, making headlines bolder and
    simplifying the bottom navigation and icons. <strong>What was left was a black
    and white UI with bold headlines where the content shined and functionality was
    clear.</strong> I appreciated the less cluttered interface and was reminded a
    bit of a platform I have been an admirer of for quite some time; <a href="http://www.medium.com">**Medium</a>**.
    Medium has been rocking the black and white since launch in 2012, and has reduced
    clutter with each redesign since; effectively making Medium one of the originators
    of CR (Complexion Reduction) without even knowing it. Congratulations, Medium!</p><p>Shortly
    after the folks over at FB unveiled Instagram’s look, I opened up the Airbnb app
    and was struck by how familiar it looked. This was my first time browsing the
    app since they <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/livethere">released a redesign
    in Apri</a>l, yet I felt like I had seen this all before.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2046/1*gGaeeFFmkDSRZ8NipWWRMA.png"
    alt=""></p><p><strong>Airbnb’s</strong> redesigned UI didn’t get nearly the media
    coverage of Instagram’s redesign a month later (partly because it wasn’t accompanied
    by a shiny new app icon) but it followed many of the same CR tactics.</p><p>The
    mobile redesign introduced larger, bolder headlines, removed unnecessary imagery
    and color and simplified their icons to make them more universally recognizable.
    <strong>What was left was a very black and white UI where the content shined and
    functionality was clear.</strong></p><p><strong>Apple</strong> is the latest example
    of designers becoming enamored by the Complexion Reduction movement. Earlier this
    month, at <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/06/heres-everything-apple-announced-wwdc-2016/">Apple’s
    WWDC</a> the tech giant announced a number of exciting things for consumers to
    look forward to, including the release of iOS 10, which they are dubbing, “The
    biggest iOS release ever!” (or at least since iOS 8 which was referred to as…
    “The biggest iOS release ever!”)</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2046/1*SrA5FVya2uVIgIbp5stq3w.png"
    alt=""></p><p>One announcement in particular caught my eye. That was <strong>the
    redesign of Apple Music</strong>. While the most important aspects of the redesign
    are UX updates and additional features, the aesthetic was the first thing I noticed.
    Caitlin McGarry, a staff writer at Macworld, <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3082637/ios/every-change-coming-to-apple-music-in-ios-10.html">described
    the updated appearance</a> well, <strong><em>“It’s a totally new look, with giant
    cards, bigger and bolder fonts, and a clean white background that allows the album
    art to shine.”</em></strong></p><p>Sound familiar? The design differs slightly
    from the blueprint used by Instagram and Airbnb (they use solid icons! What the
    heck Apple?) but the key elements are there: large bold headlines, black and white
    UI.</p><h3>SO WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?</h3><p>As I mentioned earlier, this means
    more and more of your favorite apps are going to start looking like one another.
    Why? Much like the NFL, tech is a copycat league. These redesigns were met with
    generally positive reviews (some people are complaining about a ‘lack of personality’
    in these new black and white UIs but they’ll soon get over that. You open an app
    for it’s functionality, not it’s personality) so I expect apps both new and old
    to start jumping on the CR bandwagon.</p><blockquote><h1>This means your iPhone
    home screen will soon become nothing more than a colorful mosaic of bright portals
    transporting you to Pleasantville.</h1></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2160/1*6UkyLh-9qHuSIEW0NE2aAg.png"
    alt=""></p><p><strong>Now, whether you are for or against this monochromatic fad,
    it is undoubtedly a sign of progress.</strong> The product design process is advancing
    and evolving from the old segmented approach that encouraged superfluous design
    to a more holistic process that truly is focused on the user. In the old product
    design process a UI designer may be handed wireframes by a UX or product person
    with the instructions ‘make it pretty’. That designer would then spend hours or
    days adding color, removing color, changing color when the best solution may have
    been right there in front of them all along… the wireframes! As the lines between
    UX and UI designer blur in today’s more integrated design process, designers become
    less worried about their specific responsibilities (like making it pretty) and
    focus on the ultimate goal of creating the best product for their user.</p><h3>THE
    ULTIMATE GUIDE TO COMPLEXION REDUCTION</h3><p>So you’re sold on CR and ready to
    hop on the bandwagon? Good, follow these guidelines and you’ll have an award winning
    app in no time.</p><blockquote><p><strong>1. Remove Color.</strong> Well ok, you
    can have one color, but use it extremely sparingly to indicate action. Everything
    else better be black and white. Let the content of your app bring the color.<strong>2.
    Bigger, Bolder, Blacker Headlines.</strong> You see that headline there? Bump
    it up about 20 to 30 pixels and make it HEAVY.<strong>3. Simple, Thin, Recognizable
    Icons.</strong> Your icons better be universal and no color allowed here either.
    And if you want bonus points order them left to right in this way: home, search,
    primary action, secondary action, profile.<strong>4. Double, NO, Triple your White
    Space.</strong> Maybe even quadruple it. You really can’t go wrong here.<strong>5.
    Make your App Icon Brighter</strong>. If you are fiending to design something
    with flash and color, make it the app icon. This is where you put your personality
    and brand. And make it stand out!</p></blockquote><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading!

    people</h3><p>According to <a href="http://www.jnd.org">Don Norman</a>, the human
    centred design process starts with a good understanding of people and the needs
    that the design is intended to meet. Various companies, organisations and educational
    institutions have taken on this challenge and have therefore come up with models
    in order to provide structure to the process of human centred design or design
    thinking.</p><h3>Chilli Con Carne and the Double Diamond</h3><p>When you cook
    a chilli con carne for the first time, you might start off with a recipe that
    appeals to you. Once you have burned your tongue a couple of times, you either
    go easy on the spices, or you even spice it up as you can’t get enough of the
    burning. Generally speaking, you tweak the original recipe to your own needs and
    taste.</p><blockquote><h1>…tweak the original recipe to your own needs and taste…</h1></blockquote><p>That’s
    what I have done to the design process during my previous months trying to master
    <a href="https://www.hyperisland.com/programs-and-courses/ma-digital-experience-design">Digital
    Experience Design</a> at <a href="undefined">Hyper Island</a>.</p><p>As a starting
    point for my dish, I am using the Double Diamond process, originally released
    by the <a href="http://www.designcouncil.org.uk">British Design Council</a>. I
    like this framework for its structure, clarity and dynamic.</p><h3>Point of departure
    and basics</h3><p>The core question in almost any creative or design project is
    how to get from point A – “Don’t know” or “Could be” – to point B – “Do know”
    or “Should be”. This process might seem finite and straightforward at first sight.</p><p>In
    reality, it is a never ending process, as creativity is the habit of continually
    doing things in new ways to make a positive difference to our life (Hyper Island,
    2016).</p><blockquote><h1>…creativity is the habit of continually doing things
    in new ways to make a positive difference to our life (Hyper Island, 2016).</h1></blockquote><p>The
    Double Diamond is a structured design approach to tackle challenges in four phases:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Discover
    /Research</strong>— insight into the problem (diverging)</p></li><li><p><strong>Define/Synthesis</strong>
    — the area to focus upon (converging)</p></li><li><p><strong>Develop/ Ideation</strong>—
    potential solutions (diverging)</p></li><li><p><strong>Deliver /Implementation</strong>—
    solutions that work (converging)</p></li></ol><p>Phases of this process are either
    <strong>diverging or converging</strong>. During a <strong>diverging phase</strong>,
    you try to <strong>open up</strong> as much as possible without limiting yourself,
    whereas a <strong>converging phase</strong> focuses on <strong>condensing and
    narrowing</strong> your findings or ideas.</p><p>If you google the Double Diamond
    you are bound to find various interpretations and also varying wordings. I am
    going to stick to the version above as its wording allows flexibility and agility
    in its application in my opinion. Or in other words, it is the most appealing
    recipe to me.</p><p>The four phases of the Double Diamond may be simplified and
    merged into two main stages of the process.</p><ul><li><p>*<em>Stage 1 — Doing
    the right thing (Diamond 1 — Discover and Define)*</em>Whatever you do, you ought
    to look for the right problem to solve or the right question to ask before you
    try to do so. This is all about what you do.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Stage 2 — Doing
    things right (Diamond 2 — Develop and Deliver)*</em>Once you have found the right
    question to answer or the right problem to solve, you want to make sure that you
    do this the right way. This is all about how you do it.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7680/1*X2PkalIp21_rEnCVayJOAA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The following paragraphs provide you with a step-to-step approach
    for each phase.</p><h2>Stage 1 — Doing the right thing (Diamond 1 — Discover and
    Define)</h2><p>This phase is split into <em>Discover/Research</em> and <em>Define/Synthesis</em>.</p><h3>Discover
    / Research</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Rip the brief</strong> (the usual starting point
    of your challenge) — Try to question the brief or your initial question by challenging
    every part of it and evaluating fields of interests. List as many elements as
    you can, find characteristics, define areas of interest and extremes, list places,
    people (personas), experiences that are related and can be explored.</p></li><li><p>Before
    you dive into your research, *<em>cluster your findings into topics *</em>to get
    an overview and you might have to limit yourself in terms of the scope you want
    to research.</p></li><li><p>Dive into your <strong>research</strong>. Apply <strong>primary</strong>
    (field) and <strong>secondary</strong> (desk) research methods. <a href="http://www.designkit.org/methods">Here
    is an extensive list of research methods by ideo.org.</a></p></li></ol><p>*<em>As
    a result, *</em>you ought to end up with a huge pile of unstructured research
    findings.</p><h3>Define / Synthesis</h3><p>In order to make sense of your findings,
    you want to synthesise your research by applying the following steps:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Download</strong>
    (summarise your raw findings and share them with your team) all your research.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cluster
    learnings</strong> and similarities to themes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Find insights</strong>
    (insights are the dormant truth about the consumer’s motivations, wishes or frustrations
    regarding a specific topic)build opportunity areas (a phrasing of the potential
    area of action).</p></li><li><p><strong>Create HMW questions</strong> (A so called
    “how might we...” question that makes a tangible statement of what is to be done
    or solved within the area of action).</p></li></ol><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7680/1*x7BTI1g3rRdswA6hrkMxWQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>*<em>As a result, *</em>you ought to come up with a revamped brief
    (final brief, HMW-question) that either clarifies or details the initial brief
    challenge or even contradicts it.</p><h2>Stage 2 — Doing things right (Diamond
    2 — Develop and Deliver)</h2><p>This phase is split into <em>Develop/Ideation</em>
    and <em>Deliver/Implementation</em>.</p><h3>Develop / Ideation</h3><p>As you have
    deduced the actual question to solve or challenge, you start ideating.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Ideation</strong>This
    is the fun part and as it is part of a diverging phase. You should restrain from
    limiting yourself and approach ideation with an open mind. Do not judge during
    ideation. Apply a “yes, and…” rather than a “no…” or “yes, but…” mentality. Let
    anything happen at this point and build upon each other’s ideas. There are tonnes
    of creative ideation tools and methods out there. I am not going into detail here.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evaluation</strong>
    Towards the end of an ideation phase, evaluate your ideas and select your favourite
    ones. Two tools that come in handy are dot-votings (each team member votes for
    ideas) or impact/feasibility matrices (a matrix that puts feasibility in relation
    to a potential impact of an idea).</p></li></ol><p><strong>As a result, *<em>you
    ought to end up with one or a small number of *</em>ideas</strong> you want to
    later prototype and test, in order to find the best answer or solution to your
    initial question or problem.</p><h3>Deliver / Implementation</h3><p>Once you have

  :content: <p>How to become a master manipulator of Visual Communication.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7816/1*lXzT7FsUZ7KmYFwIdrsZHA.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>Have
    you ever looked at the sky noticing an unusually shaped cloud, resembling a familiar
    animal or an object? Have you ever wondered, why or how you make this association
    just by looking at a fluffy, blob of gas? It’s all because of how your <strong>brain</strong>
    works!</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4000/1*SZT0rc5aFfgPlP_pOxJ46Q.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Your brain is always trying to make sense of the world by comparing
    previous experiences or visual patterns and <strong>connecting the dots</strong>.
    It has its own “weird” way of perceiving shape and form, grouping information,
    fill in the gaps to <strong>draw the big picture</strong>.</p><p>Having an understanding
    how your brain works will help you <strong>become a wiser designer</strong>; master
    manipulator of Visual Communication. It can help you determine which visual elements
    are most effective in any given situation, so you can use them to influence perception,
    direct attention and cause behavioural change. Something particularly useful when
    it comes to goal-oriented, problem-solving, intuitive design; <strong>User Interface
    design</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>“Great designers understand the powerful role
    that psychology plays in visual perception. What happens when someone’s eye meets
    your design creations? How does their mind react to the message your piece is
    sharing?”  — Laura Busche, Brand Content Strategist at Autodesk</p></blockquote><p>It’s
    clear by now, visual <strong>design and psychology are linked</strong> and can
    influence one another. Gestalt principles can help us understand and control these
    links.</p><h2>What is Gestalt?</h2><p>Gestalt (form, shape in German) is a group
    of visual perception principles developed by German psychologists in 1920s. It
    is built on the theory that “an organized whole, is perceived as greater than
    the sum of its parts”.</p><blockquote><h1>“The whole is other than the sum of
    the parts.”</h1><h1>— Kurt Koffka</h1></blockquote><p>The Gestalt principles attempt
    to describe how people perceive visual elements when certain conditions apply.
    <strong>They are built on four key ideas:</strong></p><h3><strong>Emergence</strong></h3><p>People
    tend to identify elements first in their general outlined form. Our brain recognises
    a simple, well-defined object quicker than a detailed one.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3040/1*d4ZjN7fxnyrZoS0Qj8oIOA.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><h3><strong>Reification</strong></h3><p>People can recognise objects
    even when there are parts of them missing. Our brain matches what we see with
    familiar patterns stored in our memory and fills in the gaps.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3042/1*LBpeuxUs-chS8ngQnQQ0_A.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><h3><strong>Multi-Stability</strong></h3><p>People will often interpret
    ambiguous objects in more than one ways. Our brains will bounce back and forth
    between the alternatives seeking certainty. As a result, one view will become
    more dominant while the other one will get harder to see.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3042/1*yVUZpugpVxhrwYtd7xVsfA.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><h3><strong>Invariance</strong></h3><p>People can recognise simple
    objects independently of their rotation, scale and translation. Our brain can
    perceive objects from different perspectives, despite their different appearance.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3042/1*HfC_M2psENePJ23lIZ5eMg.jpeg" alt=""></p><p><strong>Here’re
    the Gestalt principles which can inform today’s UI design.</strong></p><h2>Proximity</h2><p>Elements
    arranged close to each other are perceived as more related than those placed further
    apart. This way different elements are viewed mainly as a group rather than as
    individual elements.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2280/1*rb6h4RwbjHPjQl2qRLntHA.png"
    alt=""></p><h3><strong>How does the Proximity principle apply to UI design?</strong></h3><p>We
    can use the Proximity principle in UI design for grouping similar information,
    organising content and decluttering layouts. Its correct use will have a positive
    impact on visual communication and user experience.</p><p>As the principle states,
    items that are related should stay close to each other, while the unrelated items
    should stay further apart. White space plays a vital role here as it creates contrast
    guiding the users’ eyes in the intended direction. White space can boost visual
    hierarchy and information flow, contributing in easy to read and scan layouts.
    It will help users achieve their goals faster and delve deeper into the content.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4016/1*HepksZwz04AfFDQTWRCRNw.jpeg" alt=""></p><p><em>We
    can apply the Proximity principle pretty much everywhere from navigation, cards,
    galleries and banners to lists, body text and pagination.</em></p><h2>Common Region</h2><p>Similarly
    to the Proximity principle, elements placed within the same region are perceived
    as grouped.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2280/1*VxBcEZmTiwn6GhzMZTcyIw.png"
    alt=""></p><h3>How does the Common Region principle apply to UI design?</h3><p>The
    Common Region principle is particularly useful. It can help with information grouping
    and content organisation, but it can also achieve content separation or act as
    a focal point. It boosts hierarchy, scanability and assists in promoting information.</p><p>The
    Common Region principle can hold together many different elements keeping them
    unified within larger groups. We can achieve it with the use of line, colour,
    shape and shadow. It can often be used to bring elements into the foreground,
    indicating interaction or importance.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4016/1*v8mRsx28je9GFlIasdMPgQ.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p><em>A good Common Region example would be the card UI pattern; a
    well defined rectangular space with different bits of information presented as
    one. Banners and tables are good examples as well.</em></p><h2>Similarity</h2><p>Elements
    sharing similar visual characteristics are perceived to be more related than those
    not sharing similar characteristics.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2280/1*qnR1RWW8tN-OUfzlUR2ggQ.png"
    alt=""></p><h3>How does the Similarity principle apply to UI design?</h3><p>We
    tend to perceive similar to each other elements as grouped or a pattern. We also
    might think that they serve the same purpose. Similarity can help us with organising
    and classifying objects within a group and linking them with a specific meaning
    or function.</p><p>There are different ways of making elements perceived as being
    similar, and thus, related. These include similarity of colour, size, shape, texture,
    dimension, and orientation; with some of them being more strongly communicative
    than others (ex. colour &gt; size &gt; shape). When Similarity occurs, an object
    can get emphasised by being different from the rest; this is called ‘Anomaly’
    and can be used to create contrast or visual weight. It can draw the user’s attention
    to a specific piece of content (focal point) while assisting with scanability,
    discoverability and the overall flow.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4016/1*J1xJVNgjX5gxZ0FSJWgDKw.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p><em>We can use the principle of Similarity in navigation, links,
    buttons, headings, call to actions and more.</em></p><h2>Closure</h2><p>A group
    of elements are often perceived to be a single recognisable form or figure. The
    Closure also occurs when an object is incomplete, or parts of it are not enclosed.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2280/1*LxCr2o4bLGzzZpYp3tPtFw.png" alt=""></p><h3>How
    does the Closure principle apply to UI design?</h3><p>As the Closure principle
    states, when presented with the right amount of information, our brain will jump
    to conclusions by filling in the gaps and creating a unified whole. This way we
    can decrease the number of elements needed to communicate information, reducing
    complexity and making designs more engaging. Closure can help us minimise visual
    noise and convey a message, reinforcing a concept within a pretty small space.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5664/1*akm90Vz-q4eahMEWmnXa3Q.png" alt=""></p><p><em>We
    can use the Closure principle in Iconography, where simplicity helps with communicating
    meaning, swiftly and clearly.</em></p><h2>Symmetry</h2><p>Symmetrical elements
    tend to perceived as belonging together regardless of their distance, giving us
    a feeling of solidity and order.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2280/1*Y9SGHHx9Q2Dg5R6CUzIVlA.png"
    alt=""></p><h3>How does the symmetry principle apply in UI design?</h3><p>Symmetrical
    elements are simple, harmonious and visually pleasing. Our eyes seek those attributes
    along with order and stability, to make sense of the world. For this reason, Symmetry
    is a useful tool for communicating information quickly and efficiently. Symmetry
    feels comfortable helping us focus on what’s important.</p><p>Symmetrical compositions
    are satisfying, but they can also get a bit dull and static. Visual symmetry tends
    to be more dynamic, and interesting. Adding an asymmetrical element to an otherwise
    symmetrical design can help with drawing attention while making an impression;
    something useful for any point of interest or a Call To Action, for example. Symmetry,
    along with a healthy amount of asymmetry is important in any design.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4016/1*EoFv3rd9OddikEdgXa59jA.jpeg" alt=""></p><p><em>It’s
    good to use Symmetry for portfolios, galleries, product displays, listings, navigation,
    banners, and any content-heavy page.</em></p><h2>Continuation</h2><p>Elements
    arranged in a line or a soft curve are perceived to be more related than those
    arranged randomly or in a harsh line.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2280/1*qiXDOZnWm_NFprHEcDEp8w.png"
    alt=""></p><h3>How does the Continuity principle apply in UI design?</h3><p>Elements
    following a continuous line are perceived as grouped. The smoother the line segments,
    the more we see them as a unified shape; our mind prefers the path of least resistance.</p><p>Continuity
    helps us interpret direction and movement through a composition. It takes place
    when aligning elements and it can help our eyes move smoothly through the page,
    assisting with legibility. The Continuity principle strengthens the perception
    of grouped information, creating order and guiding users through different content
    segments. Disruption of continuity can signal the end of a section drawing attention
    to a new piece of content.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4016/1*_rR4aKL8rNoO9NshNMyTOA.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p><em>The linear arrangement of rows and columns are good examples
    of Continuity. We can use them in menus and sub-menus, lists, product arrangements,
    carousels, services or process/progress displays.</em></p><h2>Common Fate</h2><p>Elements
    moving towards the same direction are perceived as more related than those moving
    in different directions, or not moving at all.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2280/1*idl16iEtKFaMKbIuxn-GaA.png"
    alt=""></p><h3>How does the Common Fate principle apply in UI design?</h3><p>Regardless
    of how far apart are the elements or how dissimilar they might appear, if they
    are moving or changing together, they are perceived as related. This effect can
    take place even when movement is implied, by other visual elements.</p><p>The
    Common Fate principle is more potent when elements move synchronised; in the same
    direction and at the same time and speed. It can help with grouping relevant information
    and linking actions with results. The disruption of a synchronised movement can
    grab users’ attention and direct it to a specific element or feature. It can also,
    establish relationships between different groups or states.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4016/1*MepRPVH5VEPv4fgJsETHDg.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p><em>We can use the Common Fate principle in expandable menus, accordions,
    tool-tips, product sliders, parallax scrolls and swiping indicators.</em></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>User
    Interface Design isn’t all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. It’s mainly
    about communication, performance and convenience. Gestalt principles are always
    current helping us achieve these goals; creating a pleasant experience for the
    users and a great success for the business.</p><p>*If you enjoyed this article

  :title: Design Doesn’t Scale.
  :content: '<p>Design Doesn’t Scale is a statement that has bothered me for the last
    four-years. When I joined Spotify’s design team in 2012, the level of inconsistency
    and fragmentation shocked me. Up-close, the treatment of type, colour, imagery,
    layout, IA, and interactions just didn’t seem to align anywhere. And when I started
    talking about it, I realised the whole team was frustrated too. We concluded that
    the fragmentation in the product was just reflecting the fragmentation in the
    team, that designers spread across so many different projects, timezones and competing
    timetables, just didn’t stand a chance. And, after all, weren’t these factors
    inherent in all modern tech companies anyway? It was then that I first heard myself
    say, “Design Doesn’t Scale”.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*WmTrYFgM1OJASlGK2AuMxQ.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>But while this issue unsettled me, I tried my best not to engage
    with it — dismissing it as a lost cause — and focussing on a redesign instead.
    It didn’t work. No matter how happy I was with a design, it was always dulled
    when seen alongside several conflicting design-directions. A year after I joined
    I finally became so frustrated with this issue that I decided to make it my personal
    mission to find a solution. Surely crossing the arms and accepting that design
    doesn’t scale couldn’t be the only answer.</p><p>And so the premise for my quest
    was Design Doesn’t Scale or: How does a team of distributed designers, spread
    across different time-zones, projects and competing objectives ever find a way
    to work together so they can create one coherent experience? Here’s what we discovered.</p><h2>Principles</h2><p>It
    was during a weekly design critique that it became clear we had nothing to align
    on. Our feedback was nothing more than personal opinions based on some new design
    fad. This led to frustration for the designer presenting, and left the team with
    a feeling of uncertainty once the session was over. So in 2013, we decided to
    write some principles to turn this group of individuals into a team with a shared
    point-of-view.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*AWqeTBwnxZ_qE3hEqZwEZQ.png"

    (6) Lagom"><em>(1) Content First (2) Be Alive (3) Get Familiar (4) Do Less (5)
    Stay Authentic (6) Lagom</em></p><p>We’ve since used these principles to align
    our design critiques, shape a collective voice across design in the organisation,
    and as the foundation for the visual realignment we shipped in 2014 — a project
    that held many learnings and worthy of its own article.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7112/1*TNNtgSQ3CtIboOOEZBgFGw.png"
    alt="Spotify 2014 (Project Cat)"><em>Spotify 2014 (Project Cat)</em></p><p>What
    really made the principles work, was that we tailored them to our domain (music)
    and tied them back to our business goals, in terms that would resonate with non-designers.</p><p>Since
    launching them we’ve been exploring ways to make them stickier, for example, reducing
    them to three and making them more inclusive as Experience Principles in collaboration
    with our Marketing team.</p><h2>Guidelines</h2><p>After the visual realignment,
    it soon became clear that the hardest part would be maintaining this new found
    consistency. So in 2014, we created Spotify’s Design Language System, GLUE (a
    Global Language for a Unified Experience), which documented our styles, components,
    and patterns, on a website that was accessible to everyone in the company.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5524/1*SQjAZi0C2HYa2-73wqj9xg.png" alt="Version
    1 of Spotify’s Guidelines"><em>Version 1 of Spotify’s Guidelines</em></p><p>For
    the first time we had a shared definition of our interfaces that we could use
    to coordinate its evolution. This not only encouraged consistency and increased
    efficiency, but also created a shared vocabulary between designers and developers,
    so that the label for a colour or type-style could be understood across design-specs
    and code.</p><p>Along with the guidelines, we created UI toolkits for our design
    tools that reflected the same styles and components. This was great for kickstarting
    projects, while also highlighting what didn’t exist and might need to be added
    to the toolkit later. It also forced us to choose which applications (Photoshop
    or Illustrator or Sketch, etc.) we’d support and how we’d share files with one
    another.</p><p>Modularising design in this way has revealed the relationships
    and dependencies that make up our experience, and ultimately make it easier for
    us to collaborate with one another.</p><h2>Glue</h2><p>We soon realised that maintaining
    guidelines and toolkits is a constant effort. So after some convincing, GLUE became
    a dedicated team in 2015, made up of designers and engineers.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7762/1*6YuPfBrFs143biVHJo5ZhA.jpeg"
    alt="Team GLUE doing a mashup of a T-rex and a Superman pose."><em>Team GLUE doing
    a mashup of a T-rex and a Superman pose.</em></p><p>Being a centralised team,
    GLUE can support our distributed designers by facilitating collaboration across
    teams and providing frameworks to evolve the different design needs in the company.
    The engineers on the team extend this work by codifying the core building blocks
    from the guidelines across iOS, Android and Desktop. Providing a technical implementation
    for front-end developers across the organisation.</p><h2>Guild</h2><p>A common
    challenge with a central group is maintaining context, as it’s easy to fall out
    of touch with the current needs of the organisation and find that the solutions
    you’re providing aren’t relevant anymore. To solve this we setup the Design Guild.</p><p>Every
    week, for 1-hour, two-designers from each product mission and the GLUE team, meet
    to share context on whatever they’re working on that will have consequence for
    the others. GLUE might share updates on guidelines, while a feature designer might
    want to align on a new design they’re working on. Often these updates will result
    in a friendly-nod to acknowledge we’re aligned, or a workshop to resolve any conflicts
    in the design direction. This meeting has helped break down silos, encourage collaboration,
    and amplify a shared sense of ownership for the overall experience.</p><h2>Design
    QA</h2><p>Despite all this alignment and coordination, sometimes design bugs still
    get through. To fix this we recently set-up our first Global Design QA. It required
    designers from all our offices (Stockholm, Gothenburg, London, New York, and San
    Francisco) to come together and re-calibrate what our shared definition of quality
    is, including the practices we need to ensure they are upheld. We invited members
    of QA (Quality Assurance) to make sure designers were clear on how best to use
    tools like Jira (a bug ticketing system) and how to test their designs on all
    supported devices. This triggered many discussions, highlighting concerns from
    what kind of design bugs should be captured to how to prioritise them.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5664/1*tZ0FtcjEctT2i2Tgc42-cA.jpeg" alt="Snapshot
    from a recent Design QA workshop."><em>Snapshot from a recent Design QA workshop.</em></p><p>But
    perhaps the most fundamental topic we addressed was how we define design quality.
    Which up until then had been pretty much “you know it when you see it”. We decided
    to try a checklist instead. In it we stated that quality means following our guidelines
    and principles, and supporting our core metrics. And that when you need to deviate
    from either you take accountability for updating any affected teams or frameworks.</p><p>Looking
    for more ways to define quality, we recently began asking if a design is “in <strong>TUNE”</strong>,
    an acronym to measure all parts of the experience, including how it <em>feels</em>
    to use Spotify. This is helping to shape a strong narrative around the emotive
    aspects of our experience, and be mindful that the interface is the brand.</p><ul><li><p><strong>T</strong>one.
    Are we using the right kind of tone of voice for our brand?</p></li><li><p><strong>U</strong>sable.
    Is it accessible to everyone?</p></li><li><p><strong>N</strong>ecessary. Is that
    functionality really needed?</p></li><li><p><strong>E</strong>motive. Does it
    feel good to use? Feel like somebody cares?</p></li></ul><p>After the summer,
    we will trial the Global Design QA process as a key step for any designer preparing
    to ship something in a release. Making sure that not only will we Design QA our
    individual work, but all the work that is going live to our customers.</p><p>*<em>And
    this brings me back to today. *</em>Taking stock of the learnings the last few
    years have given me and writing this partial account of all the things that have
    worked for us. And even though I’m aware that this is not a complete journey,
    that many new challenges will arise, and some solutions might become obsolete,
    I am happy to put this personal design demon to rest, knowing that when you invest
    in aligning and co-ordinating designers, design does scale.</p><p>If you’re a
    designer, product owner or manager, and face any of these challenges, I encourage

  :title: What every product designer should take away from Lyft’s new UI
  :content: "<p>It’s as easy as thumb, two, three.</p><p>In most apps, it’s common
    to see a search bar up at the top of the screen. On social media platforms, such
    as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and even Snapchat, the search bar is at the
    top of almost every main screen. In transportation apps, that style is almost
    ubiquitous.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2250/1*mwE7AP0iU1b374Vzy7daGw.png\"

    bar down from where it used to be: all the way at the top</em></p><p>Why is this?
    <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/bars/search-bars/\">Apple</a>
    doesn’t suggest that a search bar sit towards the top of an app’s UI, nor does
    the HIG suggest that it should be persistent.</p><p>If you Google why search bars
    are at the top, <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-are-search-bars-at-the-top-and-message-input-boxes-always-at-the-bottom\">a
    Quora post</a> with this exact question pops up. <em>“Users have been trained
    to expect a search (if there is one) at the top. *</em>It’s a convention that
    a designer breaks at their own risk*<em>,</em>” says the top answer.</p><p>A product
    designer at Lyft did exactly this, and in a magnificent way.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*EAbMSikOUxfLg-Eo.jpg\"

    A perfect example of awareness design.</em></p><p>Lyft took a different approach
    with their search bar. Instead of a floating field up top, they added it to an
    overlay towards the bottom-mid section of the screen. This simple change made
    it more accessible for almost 100% of users.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XyLryHeIdFLbkY6v3e_UiA.gif\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Although we don’t think about it too often, a search bar all the
    way at the top of the screen is hard to reach. Especially for users who have smaller
    hands or users who have less flexible hands, reaching up is annoying, mostly because
    the top of the screen is far away from where their fingers sit.</p><p>If you visualize
    most apps, the main content is in the middle or lower-mid area. Tab bars for navigation,
    posts on social media, and keyboards on messaging platforms are all examples of
    important pieces of experiences sitting in a more reachable position.</p><p>Lyft’s
    search bar isn’t at the tippy-top, but it’s not at the way-bottom, it’s in a sweet
    spot for thumbs.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/NaN/1*QmKvoNyyFSQ4LB3azrAnGQ.png\"

    And, as you can see from <a href=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/twitter3.jpg\">this
    amazing meme</a> that resurfaces once a year, that’s how people do it. Lyft doesn’t

    look at this graph from the same study, half of all search bars are in the “Out
    of Reach” area. Lyft’s is right beneath the thumb in that diagram in the green
    (good) area.</p><h2>How can designers learn from this</h2><p>Look at your UI analytics,
    run user-interviews, look at what elements of the interface users interact most
    frequently. In transportation apps, that usually is the search bar. In social
    media, it might be photos or like-buttons. In shopping apps, it’s probably products.</p><p><strong>Make
    sure your most frequently interacted with elements are the most reachable elements
    of your interface.</strong></p><p>Don’t be afraid to break the mold, someone has
    to do it first. Although you want to make your UI familiar to your user, keep
    in mind how comfortable it is as well.</p><p>Think about the different sizes and
    ages of hands experiencing your interface and the demographics your catering to.
    Ask yourself, “Is my experience adaptable for and aware of the different abilities
    of my users?”</p><p>And finally, don’t become <em>too</em> attached. Styles change,
    new designers might join your company. Remember 3D-ish elements in iOS 6? Welcome

  :title: Eleven Untranslatable Words From Other Cultures
  :content: '<p>The relationship between words and their meaning is a fascinating
    one, and linguists have spent countless years deconstructing it, taking it apart
    letter by letter, and trying to figure out why there are so many feelings and
    ideas that we cannot even put words to, and that our languages cannot identify.<center><em>Words
    and illustrations by <a href="http://blog.maptia.com/posts/an-unconventional-intern">Ella

    Ella, and learn more at <a href="http://untranslatablebook.com/">untranslatablebook.com</a>.</center></p><p>The
    idea that words cannot always say everything has been written about extensively
    — as Friedrich Nietzsche said,</p><blockquote><p>Words are but symbols for the
    relations of things to one another and to us; nowhere do they touch upon the absolute
    truth.</p></blockquote><p>No doubt the best book we’ve read that covers the subject
    is ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Through-Language-Glass-Different-Languages/dp/0312610491">Through

    narrowing it down to just a handful, we’ve illustrated 11 of these wonderful,

    a few of them into our everyday conversations, and hope that you enjoy recognising
    a feeling or two of your own among them.</em></p><h2><strong>1 | German: *Waldeinsamkeit</strong>*</h2><p>A

  :title: 'Sustainability is not enough: we need regenerative cultures'
  :content: '<p>Sustainability is not enough: we need regenerative cultures</p><p>By
    Daniel C. Wahl</p><p>Sustainability alone is not an adequate goal. The word sustainability
    itself is inadequate, as it does not tell us what we are actually trying to sustain.
    In 2005, after spending two years working on my doctoral thesis on design for
    sustainability, I began to realize that what we are actually trying to sustain
    is the underlying pattern of health, resilience and adaptability that maintain
    this planet in a condition where life as a whole can flourish. Design for sustainability
    is, ultimately, design for human and planetary health (Wahl, <a href="https://www.academia.edu/3991372/Design_for_Human_and_Planetary_Health_-_A_transdisciplinary_approach_to_sustainability_Daniel_Christian_Wahl_WIT_Press_2006">2006b</a>).</p><p>A
    regenerative human culture is healthy, resilient and adaptable; it cares for the
    planet and it cares for life in the awareness that this is the most effective
    way to create a thriving future for all of humanity. The concept of resilience
    is closely related to health, as it describes the ability to recover basic vital
    functions and bounce back from any kind of temporary breakdown or crisis. When
    we aim for sustainability from a systemic perspective, we are trying to sustain
    the pattern that connects and strengthens the whole system. Sustainability is
    first and foremost about systemic health and resilience at different scales, from
    local, to regional and global.</p><p>Complexity science can teach us that as participants
    in a complex dynamic eco- psycho-social system that is subject to certain biophysical
    limits, our goal has to be appropriate participation, not prediction and control
    (Goodwin, 1999a). The best way to learn how to participate appropriately is to
    pay more attention to systemic relationships and interactions, to aim to support
    the resilience and health of the whole system, to foster diversity and redundancies
    at multiple scales, and to facilitate positive emergence through paying attention
    to the quality of connections and information flows in the system. This book explores
    *how *this might be done. [This is an excerpt of a subchapter from <a href="http://www.triarchypress.net/designing-regenerative-cultures.html">Designing
    Regenerative Cultures</a>, published by Triarchy Press, 2016.]</p><h2><strong>Using
    the Precautionary Principle</strong></h2><p>One proposal for guiding wise action
    in the face of dynamic complexity and ‘not knowing’ is to apply the *Precautionary
    Principle *as a framework that aims to avoid, as far as possible, actions that
    will negatively impact on environmental and human health in the future. From the
    United Nation’s ‘World Charter for Nature’ in 1982, to the Montreal Protocol on
    Health in 1987, to the Rio Declaration in 1992, the Kyoto Protocol, and Rio+20
    in 2012, we have committed to applying the Precautionary Principle over and over
    again.</p><p>The <a href="http://sehn.org/wingspread-conference-on-the-precautionary-principle/">Wingspread
    Consensus Statement on the Precautionary Principle</a> states: “When an activity
    raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures
    should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established
    scientifically” (Wingspread Statement, 1998). The principle puts the burden of
    proof that a certain action is not harmful on those proposing and taking the action,
    yet general practice continues to allow all actions that have not (yet!) been
    proven to have potentially harmful effects to go ahead unscrutinized. In a nutshell,
    the Precautionary Principle can be summarized as follows: practice precaution
    in the face of uncertainty. This is *not *what we are doing.</p><p>While high-level
    UN groups and many national governments have repeatedly considered the Precautionary
    Principle as a wise way to guide actions, day-to-day practice shows that it is
    very hard to implement, as there will always be some degree of uncertainty. The
    Precautionary Principle could also potentially stop sustainable innovation and
    block potentially highly beneficial new technologies on the basis that it cannot
    be proven with certainty that these technologies will not result in unexpected
    future side-effects that could be detrimental to human or environmental health.</p><p><strong>Why
    not challenge designers, technologists, policy-makers, and planning professionals
    to evaluate their proposed actions on their positive, life-sustaining, restorative
    and regenerative potential?</strong></p><p><strong>Why not limit the scale of
    implementation of any innovation to local and regional levels until proof of its
    positive impact is unequivocally demonstrated?</strong></p><p>Aiming to design
    for systemic health may not save us from unexpected side-effects and uncertainty,
    but it offers a trial and error path towards a regenerative culture. We urgently
    need a Hippocratic Oath for design, technology and planning: do no harm! To make
    this ethical imperative operational we need a salutogenic (health generating)
    intention behind all design, technology and planning: *We need to design for human,
    ecosystems and planetary health. *This way we can move more swiftly from the unsustainable
    ‘business as usual’ to restorative and regenerative innovations that will support
    the transition towards a regenerative culture. Let us ask ourselves:</p><p><strong>How
    do we create design, technology, planning and policy decisions that positively
    support human, community and environmental health?</strong></p><p>We need to respond
    to the fact that human activity over the last centuries and millennia has done
    damage to healthy ecosystems functioning. Resource availability is declining globally,
    while demand is rising as the human population continues to expand and we continue
    to erode ecosystems functions through irresponsible design and lifestyles of unbridled
    consumption.</p><p>If we meet the challenge of decreasing demand and consumption
    globally while replenishing resources through regenerative design and technology,
    we have a chance of making it through the eye of the needle and creating a regenerative
    human civilization. This shift will entail a transformation of the material resource
    basis of our civilization, away from fossil resources and towards renewably regenerated
    biological resources, along with a radical increase in resource productivity and
    recycling. Bill Reed has mapped out some of the essential shifts that will be
    needed to create a truly regenerative culture.</p><blockquote><h1><em>“Instead
    of doing less damage to the environment, it is necessary to learn how we can participate
    with the environment — using the health of ecological systems as a basis for design.
    […] The shift from a fragmented worldview to a whole systems mental model is the
    significant leap our culture must make — framing and understanding living system
    interrelationships in an integrated way. A place-based approach is one way to
    achieve this understanding. […] Our role, as designers and stakeholders is to
    shift our relationship to one that creates a whole system of mutually beneficial
    relationships.”</em> — Bill Reed (2007: 674)</h1></blockquote><p>Reed named ‘whole-systems
    thinking’ and ‘living-systems thinking’ as the foundations of the shift in mental
    model that we need to create a regenerative culture. In Chapters 3, 4 and 5, we
    will explore these necessary shifts in perspective in some detail. They go hand-
    in-hand with a radical reframing of our understanding of sustainability. As Bill
    Reed puts it: “Sustainability is a progression towards a functional awareness
    that all things are connected; that the systems of commerce, building, society,
    geology, and nature are really one system of integrated relationships; that these
    systems are co-participants in the evolution of life” (2007). Once we make this
    shift in perspective we can understand life as “a whole process of continuous
    evolution towards richer, more diverse, and mutually beneficial relationships”.
    Creating regenerative systems is not simply a technical, economic, ecological
    or social shift: it has to go hand-in-hand with an underlying shift in the way
    we think about ourselves, our relationships with each other and with life as a
    whole.</p><p>Figure 1 shows the different shifts in perspective as we move from
    ‘business as usual’ to creating a regenerative culture. The aim of creating regenerative
    cultures transcends and includes sustainability. *Restorative design *aims to
    restore healthy self-regulation to local ecosystems, and *reconciliatory design
    *takes the additional step of making explicit humanity’s participatory involvement
    in life’s processes and the unity of nature and culture. *Regenerative design
    *creates regenerative cultures capable of continuous learning and transformation
    in response to, and anticipation of, inevitable change. Regenerative cultures
    safeguard and grow biocultural abundance for future generations of humanity and
    for life as a whole.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3156/1*IFHiDsVU-Yxhx_kjUA-TCw.jpeg"
    alt="Figure 1: Adapted from Reed (2006) with the author’s permission"><em>Figure
    1: Adapted from Reed (2006) with the author’s permission</em></p><p>The ‘story
    of separation’ is reaching the limits of its usefulness and the negative effects
    of the associated worldview and resulting behaviour are beginning to impact on
    life as a whole. By having become a threat to planetary health we are learning
    to rediscover our intimate relationship with all of life. Bill Reed’s vision of
    regenerative design for systemic health is in line with the pioneering work of
    people like Patrick Geddes, Aldo Leopold, Lewis Mumford, Buckminster Fuller, Ian
    McHarg, E.F. Schumacher, John Todd, John Tillman Lyle, David Orr, Bill Mollison,
    David Holmgren, and many others who have explored design in the context of the
    health of the whole system.</p><p>A new cultural narrative is emerging, capable
    of birthing and informing a truly regenerative human culture. We do not yet know
    all the details of how exactly this culture will manifest, nor do we know all
    the details of how we might get from the current ‘world in crisis’ situation to
    that thriving future of a regenerative culture. Yet aspects of this future are
    already with us.</p><p>In using the language of ‘old story’ and ‘new story’ we
    are in danger of thinking of this cultural transformation as a replacement of
    the old story by a new story. Such separation into dualistic opposites is in itself
    part of the ‘separation narrative’ of the ‘old story’. The ‘new story’ is not
    a complete negation of the currently dominant worldview. It includes this perspective
    but stops regarding it as the only perspective, opening up to the validity and
    necessity of multiple ways of knowing.</p><p>Embracing uncertainty and ambiguity
    makes us value multiple perspectives on our appropriate participation in complexity.
    These are perspectives that give value and validity not only to the ‘old story’
    of separation, but also to the ‘ancient story’ of unity with the Earth and the
    cosmos. These are perspectives that may help us find a regenerative way of being
    human in deep intimacy, reciprocity and communion with life as a whole by becoming
    conscious co-creators of humanity’s ‘new story’.</p><p>Our impatience and urgency
    to jump to answers, solutions and conclusions too quickly is understandable in
    the face of increasing individual, collective, social, cultural and ecological
    suffering, but this tendency to favour answers rather than to deepen into the
    questions is in itself part of the old story of separation.</p><p>The art of transformative
    cultural innovation is to a large extent about making our peace with ‘not knowing’
    and living into the questions more deeply, making sure we are asking the right
    questions, paying attention to our relationships and how we all bring forth a
    world not just through what we are doing, but through the quality of our being.

    alt=""></p><p>I n June of 2015 I picked up the phone and dialed my old friend
    Rick’s number, guided by the muscle memory of having done it so many times before.
    This time, the topic wouldn’t be our excitement over the new Dungeon Master’s
    guide or some neat piece of esoterica we had learned in Mr. Zebracki’s history
    class. This discussion would be much more abstract.</p><p>“I have something to
    tell you, Rick,” I began. “I realized recently that I’m transgender, and I’m planning
    on transitioning genders at some point in the next year or so, so that I can live
    my life a little more honestly.”</p><p>After a moment of silence, Rick said exactly
    what I was hoping to hear: “You’re one of my oldest friends. If that’s what you
    think you need to do, of course I support it, and I’ll help you however you need
    me to.” But he also had some questions: Would I still play video games? Would
    I still like Star Wars?</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*eB2co0-uDTwoHWY0pTy9Hg.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><blockquote><h1>My friend had some questions: Would I still play video
    games? Would I still like Star Wars?</h1></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*eB2co0-uDTwoHWY0pTy9Hg.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>Rick and I bonded in high school over our mutual love of nerd culture,
    which we had embraced long before anyone else thought it was cool. It started
    with daily after-school pilgrimages to the comic shop to buy Star Wars cards,
    our beloved pastime which occupied us for hours. The amount of time and money
    we spent on them was ungodly. As we grew older, Star Wars cards eventually gave
    way to encyclopedic knowledge on movies, music, anime. Rick even found a way to
    make sports nerdy with his encyclopedic knowledge of the history and statistics
    of any given game. For us it was more than an obsession. It was in our DNA.</p><p>And
    yet Rick still wondered whether changing my gender presentation would affect that
    bone-deep love. He wasn’t the only one; I found this reaction common for many
    of the people with whom I shared the news of my transition. Friends would ask
    me, “Can we still talk about Doctor Who?” and “Does this mean you won’t play Starcraft
    with me anymore?” My dad even asked me if I’d still want to make beer with him
    the way we do every Thanksgiving. The nature of these questions made me realize
    just how invested people were in the assumed gender alignment of the activities
    we all enjoyed together.</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/5c0baf004f395b6ee42a6e3e7902f994"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>My reply was always the same, “Of course I’m still going
    to do all of those things!” From my perspective, I was making a change that would
    lighten my mood and allow me to enjoy life better. Yes, I would look different,
    and I would be happier, but I wasn’t concerned that any of my passions or interests
    would disappear. To my friends and family who expressed these concerns, I may
    as well have been walking away from everything that made up my personality.</p><p>Where
    did this idea come from? We had plenty of girls in our circles when we were younger
    — there were girls playing with us whenever we sat down for a game. And yet, the
    fact that I would be transitioning had thrown an urgent and devastating curve-ball
    into the systems of some of my oldest friends. For the first time, I realized
    that at a basic level, they thought that nerd culture was “boy stuff.” Before
    my transition I hadn’t thought much about how that attitude might have affected
    the girls’ experience. But now that I was moving from being one of the boys to
    “just like one of the boys,” I realized how different those experiences really
    are.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*eB2co0-uDTwoHWY0pTy9Hg.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><blockquote><h1>Now that I was moving from being one of the boys to

    alt=""></p><p>For people who are socialized as men, being part of a predominantly
    male clique is an important part of building a self-concept. Being a member of
    a tribe supplies men with a healthy sense of validation and inclusion. We see
    the importance of this male tribalism on full display in team sports. To be chosen
    last during team selection is the greatest mark of masculine inferiority that
    could have been suffered by a boy.</p><p>The idea of “brotherhood” is axiomatic
    to our understanding of how all-male brigades fought their way through both world
    wars. It’s that same pack mentality that gave rise to concepts like “guy code,”
    “bros before hoes,” and “locker room talk.” Without feeling a connection to it,
    some men feel that they are missing out on a <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/06/18/how-to-create-a-lifelong-brotherhood/">crucial
    part of life</a>.<a href="https://theestablishment.co/white-men-dont-own-nerd-culture-and-i-m-not-stealing-it-c48aaf5e5354"><strong>White
    Men Don’t Own Nerd Culture, And I’m Not Stealing It</strong>theestablishment.co</a></p><p>As
    Katelyn Burns points out, <a href="https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/a-girl-in-the-boys-locker-room">the
    essence of male hierarchy</a> touches all cultures. So it should come as no surprise
    that it also touched communities I was involved with. I, too, had been socialized
    to believe that certain things were for men and other things were for women, and
    any crossover should be looked at as foreign and suspicious. I don’t blame men
    for these aspects of toxic masculinity that seep into the general population.
    That’s what’s given to them. It’s a part of the blueprint men are handed in youth,
    the same blueprint I was given and lived with uncomfortably for 27 years of my
    life.</p><p>Girls, on the other hand, tend to approach being “one of the guys”
    as something we use to get <em>past *gender barriers and just engage with the
    things we like. Women tend to see the activities we participate in as less enabled
    by gender (i.e. “boxing is a sport for men”) and more enabled *in spite</em> of
    gender (i.e. “just because I’m a girl doesn’t mean I can’t be a boxer”).</p><p>But
    we are also conscious that our participation in male-dominated activities tends
    to be at the leisure of the men involved, and that membership in the group could
    be revoked at any time. For example, if one of the men begins to pursue a woman
    in the group romantically and she doesn’t return his interest, her continued participation
    may be threatened. This becomes even riskier for women in male dominated professions
    like cybersecurity — my own field of expertise. In professional settings, the
    stakes raise dramatically. Rejection of a man’s advances can cost us more than
    our hobby, sometimes it can cost us our jobs. As long as this dynamic exists,
    we can never truly* *be “one of the guys.”</p><p>Often, we deal with this fundamental
    outsiderness by creating secret spaces where we can pursue feminine interests
    on our own terms, where being “one of the guys” is no longer the only key for
    entry. When I reintegrated into my old hobbies post-transition, I found that there
    were entire subcultures built by the women of the group, for the women of the
    group. These small, isolated, and distinctive societies that women created were
    completely invisible to me before I transitioned, but when I returned to nerd
    culture I found myself added to secret chat rooms and invited to events just for
    the girls.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*eB2co0-uDTwoHWY0pTy9Hg.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><blockquote><h1>When I reintegrated into my old hobbies post-transition,
    I found that there were entire subcultures built by women, for women.</h1></blockquote><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*eB2co0-uDTwoHWY0pTy9Hg.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>It
    was like finding a secret room in a house I lived in for decades. In these women-centered
    spaces, topics of feminine interest could be discussed openly and out of view
    of the men in the group. We were shielding them from being grossed out or bored
    — periods, eew! Fashion, ugh! — but more than that, we were shielding ourselves
    from having to openly remind anyone that we were women and thus inherently different.
    We feared that if they noticed, our passageway into acceptance might close.</p><p>I
    watched this happen many times online, in particularly hostile ways. Once they
    realized that an opponent was a woman, players in online games like Battlefield,
    Counterstrike, or Halo, emboldened by anonymity, would launch into misogynistic
    attacks after every victory or loss, or sometimes for no reason at all. Any given
    round I could expect to hear any number of sage platitudes such as, “go back to
    the kitchen,” or “why don’t you make me a sandwich?” not to mention a barrage
    of slurs. And female streamers on twitch.tv spend almost as much time fending
    off jerks as they spend talking about the game.</p><p>The nerd culture narrative
    is that we’re a group of outcasts and rejects, who built a community to cope with
    the awkwardness and rejection of being a pariah in a school social structure that
    didn’t value the same things we did. But we also brought the seeds of our own
    inherent caste systems with us, which in many ways perpetuated an unspoken marginalization
    of the girls that in some cases bordered on outright contempt. It forced the girls
    to find ways to evolve, and to express themselves despite the constraints that
    exist when the men make the rules.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*eB2co0-uDTwoHWY0pTy9Hg.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><blockquote><h1>I’ve found that the road to acceptance runs directly
    through a minefield of toxic masculinity.</h1></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*eB2co0-uDTwoHWY0pTy9Hg.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>Nerd culture is always going to be a part of me and my history.
    I wouldn’t be who I am without it, and I’m glad that I still have a place in my
    communities no matter what I’m wearing, what my name is, or how I look. In many
    places — at my local gaming store, at my friends’ houses, and in these women-centric
    spaces I never saw before — I’ve found the accepting and understanding community
    that nerd culture is supposed to be. But I’ve also realized how far we are from
    being that all the time, for everyone. I’ve found that the road to acceptance
    runs directly through a minefield of toxic masculinity, and that women’s participation
    is often tentative — and often requires that we leave our woman-ness at the door.</p><p>Our
    identities are complex. The interests of most women are both broad and deep, as
    is our capability to adapt to situations in both casual and professional settings.
    Being the versatile creatures that we are, women will always find a way into communities
    that interest us. Whether we get there with the help of some awesome men or in
    spite of the worst men, we are armed with an understanding of where each of us
    is coming from. With that in mind, we have a chance to set aside any preconceived
    expectations we have of gender and fight the goblins together. We’re going to
    need all the help we can get.<a href="https://theestablishment.co/why-we-dont-have-a-comments-section-4b491cc4fab"><strong>Looking

  :title: Google & Apple — A Tale of Two Product Cultures
  :content: '<p>Google &amp; Apple — A Tale of Two Product Cultures</p><h3>The data-driven
    engineering approach and the intuition-driven liberal arts approach</h3><p><em>Google
    and Apple are two of the most successful and admired technology companies, yet
    their approach to product development differs in some fundamental aspects. Google’s
    is based heavily on data and experimentation and might be called the engineering
    approach. Apple’s relies more on vision and intuition and might be called the
    liberal arts approach.</em></p><p>In a <a href="https://svpg.com/the-greatest-coach/">recent
    article by Marty Cagan</a>, product management expert and author of “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35249663-inspired">Inspired
    — How to Create Tech Products Customers Love</a>”, he observes the following about
    difference in leading tech companies’ product cultures:</p><blockquote><p>I talk
    a lot about product culture and how important it is, but one inconvenient fact
    has always bothered me, which is that my favorite product companies — for example,
    Google, Apple and Amazon — all have such <strong>different</strong> cultures.</p></blockquote><p>The
    difference between Apple and Google in particular is illustrated in the following
    tweet by Ken Kocienda, author of the book “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37638098-creative-selection">Creative
    Selection: Inside Apple’s Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs</a>”.</p><iframe
    src="https://medium.com/media/fac5ed75be9f28da066b13b39b429cdb" frameborder=0></iframe><p>Of
    course, this quote perfectly matches what one would expect Apple’s approach to
    product development to look like, and the way the author throws shade at Google’s
    “41 shades of blue” test demonstrates a lot of disdain for that example of data-driven
    product decisions taken to the extreme.</p><p>These two companies, Apple and Google,
    epitomize the difference between quantitative and qualitative thinking in product
    development philosophies, cultures, and processes. Google’s approach might be
    called the engineering approach, and Apple’s the liberal arts approach. Obviously,
    both approaches can be successful: Apple and Google are two of the most successful,
    valuable, and admired companies in the world.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*rlQAn1FY8fc71U7wJSZiHw.png"
    alt=""></p><h2>Google’s data-driven “engineering” approach</h2><p>Google is first
    and foremost a data company. From its mission to “organize the world’s information
    and make it universally accessible and useful” over its original product, the
    search engine, to the technologies such as BigTable or map/reduce that it has
    perfected for handling massive amounts of data, Google’s focus and core competency
    is handling data (lots of it).</p><p>With this focus on data comes a natural tendency
    to trust data for making product decisions. If you have such a treasure trove
    of data available at your fingertips, it makes sense to use it when developing
    or improving products: if you have enough users (and Google certainly does), you
    can A/B test almost anything, including shades of blue.</p><p>It is also of course
    not a coincidence that with Google Analytics / Optimize, Google is offering the
    entry level A/B testing tool that a lot of companies use before moving on to more
    sophisticated ones.</p><p>Beyond just being very data-driven and A/B test heavy,
    Google has also displayed a very low barrier to launching new products. Google
    might be the tech company that has launched and killed the highest number of products
    (some with fiercely loyal fans): Inbox, Google Reader, Google+,… The list goes
    on. Obviously, part of Google’s approach is to launch quickly and kill quickly
    (presumably, based on usage data).</p><p>Google is also famous for its management
    framework “Objectives and Key Results” (OKRs), which was conceived at Intel but
    perfected at Google. Management through OKRs involves setting priorities in the
    form of “objectives” (for example, “Improve new user onboarding”), and defining
    measurable “key results” that determine whether progress toward the objective
    was made (for example, “increase completion rate of the signup flow from 80% to
    85%”). Given the focus on measurable results, OKRs more naturally favor a data-driven
    or data-informed way of product development.</p><p>More recently, one of Google’s
    biggest core competencies is machine learning (again, driven by Google’s massive
    amounts of data). Machine learning makes (qualitatively) reasoning through product
    decisions harder: you can’t think through and actively design all “rules” of the
    model, or even validate what outputs the model will produce in all possible circumstances.
    On the other hand, it makes building data-driven feedback loops even easier: they
    can feed back right into the model without any human intervention — the product
    improves itself.</p><p>Google can’t possibly “design” the search results (including
    rich previews etc.) for every possible search query, but it can design a machine
    learning algorithm that gets better with every user interaction: the user behavior
    on the page, including which search result the user clicks, can inform what results
    future users will be shown for a similar query. This is data-driven product development
    driven to the extreme. Therefore, the application of machine learning fits extremely
    well with Google’s product development approach and even reinforces it.</p><p>In
    summary, Google’s products, core competencies, and management techniques are all
    very much aligned around an extremely data-driven approach to product development.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*AJgZIh17uDNd0fDY4HPPPw.png" alt=""></p><h2>Apple’s
    intuition-driven “liberal arts” approach</h2><p>Apple is at its core a hardware
    company. Of course, Apple also makes a lot of software, but most of it is very
    tightly coupled to the hardware and/or intended to make the hardware more valuable.
    Hardware development by nature is less iterative and requires a greater amount
    of “perfection” once the product ships. Software can be patched after release,
    even more so in Google’s case where a lot of the software is run on Google’s servers,
    but a flaw in the design of the hardware can’t be ironed out after launch. Apple
    brings this scrutiny in the design process to its software development efforts
    too.</p><p>Apple’s hardware products are also “luxury products”, or at least high-end
    products. If you want the most affordable or value-for-money phone, computer,
    media player, etc. you are not going to buy the Apple version of the product.
    This means that Apple can command a price premium, but it also means that customer
    expectations are that the products work flawlessly, or at least attain a higher
    level of perfection than competitor products.</p><p>In “Creative Selection”, Ken
    Kocienda summarizes his view of the Apple way of software product development:</p><blockquote><p>A
    small group of passionate, talented, imaginative, ingenious, ever-curious people
    built a work culture based on applying their inspiration and collaboration with
    diligence, craft, decisiveness, taste, and empathy and, through a lengthy progression
    of demo-feedback sessions, repeatedly tuned and optimized heuristics and algorithms,
    persisted through doubts and setbacks, selected the most promising bits of progress
    at every step, all with the goal of creating the best products possible.</p></blockquote><p>Interestingly,
    like Google, Apple also uses an iterative, evolutionary approach to product development.
    However, the evolution is not achieved by building small increments, releasing
    them as experiments, and gathering data about how successful they were in moving
    some KPI. Rather, the evolution is internal, through a process of demo sessions
    with leadership which provides both feedback and the vision for where the product
    should eventually end up.</p><p>This internal evolution is not driven by data,
    nor even by direct feedback from users and customers. Instead, it is driven by
    empathy and taste, two very qualitative means of making decisions. In Ken Kocienda’s
    words:</p><blockquote><p>[<strong>Empathy</strong> means] trying to see the world
    from other people’s perspectives and creating work that fits into their lives
    and adapts to their needs. […] <strong>Taste</strong> is developing a refined
    sense of judgment and finding the balance that produces a pleasing and integrated
    whole.</p></blockquote><p>Apple’s feedback loops, and therefore the entire way
    of product development, is hence more qualitative, and perhaps even more subjective.</p><p>While
    you perhaps need a visionary leader like Steve Jobs to maximize the impact of
    this qualitatively driven liberal arts approach to product development, the evolutionary
    approach of developing demos and gathering feedback on them has worked well for
    Apple, and allowed them to consistently ship products that are of higher quality
    and more “tasteful” than their competitors.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*uU3Rp9tOXf40Bsm67934uQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>One aspect of this difference in product cultures that I find particularly
    interesting is how this manifests itself in the development ecosystems of these
    two companies — after all, they own the vast majority of the mobile platform market.
    I witnessed one anecdote illustrating this in a workshop about in-app subscriptions,
    hosted by Apple. One participant brought up the question how pricing A/B tests
    should be run on iOS — and another (non-Apple) participant responded by saying
    that the best way of running pricing A/B tests was to run them on Android. Given
    the background of these two different product cultures, the reason becomes clearer:
    Apple does not really believe in A/B testing as a necessary product development
    tool, but Google does, so it’s not a surprise that Google’s developer tools more
    easily enable A/B testing than Apple’s.</p><p><em>I hope you found this article

  :title: How great Product Managers contribute to great engineering cultures
  :content: <p>Great engineers leave when they are no longer excited by an opportunity.</p><p>These
    engineers are in demand, they have other companies constantly knocking on their
    doors, pitching them exciting opportunities, as well as money, in an attempt to
    convince them to leave.</p><p>Given that cutthroat environment, <strong>how do
    we,</strong> <strong>as product managers, contribute to a strong engineering culture?</strong>
    Why should we care enough to make that our responsibility?</p><p>Great product
    managers want to work with great engineers, but not every engineer knows what
    it means to work with a product manager. Company cultures can change what the
    role of product management is and can dictate the power dynamic between product
    and engineering in amazing ways.</p><p>Additionally, there are some product managers
    out there who don’t understand why it’s important to foster a constructive relationship
    with engineering.</p><h2>Misconceptions of the role of product management</h2><p>Many
    engineers that I’ve met have been skeptical of the real value that product managers
    bring to a team. Rightfully so, since many of them have not had productive relationships
    with their PM’s.</p><p>Ask an engineer who’s worked with a bad PM, or has not
    had a productive relationship with an otherwise capable PM, and they’ll tell you
    that their PM…</p><ul><li><p>Slowed things down through unnecessary processes,
    meetings, ceremonies, etc.</p></li><li><p>Advocated for onerous levels of documentation
    and testing, or overlooked them entirely</p></li><li><p>Made frequent attempts
    to map their work with tedious metrics, overlooking the value that they created</p></li><li><p>Pushed
    their team towards building things that were not perceived as being valuable</p></li></ul><p>Bad
    product management can be a key contributor to an engineering culture that drives
    top performers away.</p><p>Engineers are the single most important resource that
    a tech company has to leverage, and designing crappy products is a fantastic way
    to waste their time.</p><h2>Why engineers stay or leave</h2><p>At a previous job,
    a senior product manager would often insist</p><blockquote><p>Engineers just want
    to build, they don’t care about impact</p></blockquote><p>This is a common refrain
    by those who are skeptical of the value of focusing on outcomes. “Engineers don’t
    want to hear all this talk about the outcomes we’re achieving, they just want
    to work on interesting tech.”</p><p>In a talk that he gave which inspired me to
    pen this article, <a href="undefined">John Cutler</a>, Product Advocate at Amplitude,
    spoke to the reasons that engineers stay. In his talk, John said that truly great
    engineers care deeply about making a difference through their efforts, but that
    most organizations are not set up in such a way that those engineers can feel
    their impact.</p><p>Without a notion of the impact their work is making, all engineers
    have to work on is how interesting the tech is. Inevitably, most smart and curious
    engineers’ desire to work on new tech will outstrip the rate that any product
    will adopt those technologies. There are strategies that you can use to adopt
    new technologies faster and such — hackathons, for instance, but that’s for another
    article.</p><h2>Product Managers are user cheerleaders…</h2><p>Consider what I
    believe to be an underrated and undersold role of product management — optimizing
    for excitement. It’s our job to make sure that we’re pitching projects that are
    enticing to our engineering team.</p><p>Now, I’m not saying that we need to make
    every project sound sexy, because not every project is. Every project needs to
    sound important within the context of your company’s mission. Revamping a login
    page might not sound exciting, but improving access to your product by an order
    of magnitude (and all of the ancillary benefits that come with it) might sound
    more exciting.</p><blockquote><h1>Product managers can help their companies by
    focusing on what users are feeling, because great engineers are motivated by users
    in pain. (<a href="https://ctt.ac/eiUaN">tweet this</a>)</h1></blockquote><p>The
    key factor here is the focus on outcomes. Great products are built on all of the
    little, non-sexy things that users never notice. Nobody is going to go home telling
    their friends and family about how sexy your login experience is, or how quickly
    your pages load, but those things are essential to your teams’ success.</p><p>The
    way to get teams to really care about whatever work is most important to users.
    In my experience, engineers have an unyielding desire to save people from bad
    tech or instances where there isn’t any tech to solve a given problem. The trouble,
    though, is that getting in the heads of users is a full-time job. Enter the Product
    Manager.</p><p>Product managers can help their companies by focusing on what users
    are feeling because great engineers are motivated by users in pain. Spending time
    in the field, on the phone, and otherwise getting to know users and their habits
    is an essential role of product managers who want their engineers to feel the
    <em>why</em> of what they’re building.</p><h2>…and measurement maestros</h2><p>On
    top of that, Product Managers need to carry the battle standard of measurement
    as an indicator of success. The metrics you use need to be those that tell the
    story of what your users are feeling, whether their problems are being solved
    or not.</p><p>Many PM’s, including yours truly, rush to the “let’s measure everything”
    approach. This is certainly better than not measuring anything, but it can be
    confusing. The common big board of metrics, in its least useful form, is a puzzling
    hodgepodge of metrics, like an episode of Game of Thrones with so many characters
    that you can’t keep the story straight.</p><p>One way to attack this problem of
    metric overwhelm is a concept that <a href="undefined">Josh Elman</a> popularized
    called “The Only Metric that Matters”. It involves picking a keystone metric that
    measures the number of users performing some key action in a particular time frame.
    For example, Airbnb’s OMtM is:</p><p><em>Number of users that book 4 trips in
    a year</em></p><p>You can see how this metric tells a story in and of itself.
    The Only Metric that Matters is a great grounding presence in an infrastructure
    of many different measures. It makes it harder for us data-driven PM’s to bend
    our component metrics to tell biased stories.</p><h2>Great PM’s get engineers
    involved in the conversation</h2><p>Back in the day, PM’s were often given the
    moniker <strong><em>CEO of a product</em></strong>. I think that’s an outdated
    notion.</p><p>Great PM’s coordinate. They gather and synthesize data, opinions,
    and skillsets.</p><p>Engineers can often feel ambushed by PM’s who don’t keep
    them properly in the loop about future work. With all of our responsibilities,
    it’s all too easy for a PM to unilaterally write tickets that engineers see for
    the first time when they are asked to start working. This phenomenon, which I
    call “throwing tickets over the wall”, is a harmful innovation antipattern.</p><p>Instead,
    great product managers have engineering involved in the ideation and prioritization
    discussion from day 1. Day 0 even.</p><p>For early-stage projects, I turn to the
    <strong>Three Amigos</strong>, a group that is generally comprised of a team’s
    PM, engineering lead, and designer. When possible, QA representation is often
    also a good idea. This group’s job is to vet early-stage product ideas and conduct
    experiments to assess the potential risks of those ideas.</p><p>Later-stage projects
    often benefit from <strong>Story Time</strong>, wherein the engineering team is
    invited to partake in a session where large projects are broken down into smaller
    component stories with well-written acceptance criteria. This is best conducted
    as a series of short, opt-in meetings throughout the week, where engineers can
    decide whether they’re going to attend based on the topics to be discussed. It’s
    very important to have Design representation to clarify requirements from wireframes,
    and QA representation to gain an understanding of the context around functionality
    and propose appropriate testing.</p><p>There are other techniques out there that
    can help to get people involved. a 3–5 day <strong>Design Sprint</strong> can
    help to flesh out some of the early questions around a product that can cripple
    momentum. <strong>Brainstorming</strong> can be a great way to ensure that a diverse
    set of perspectives are considered with regards to the requirements for a particular
    project, or the roadmap for a product.</p><p>Great PM’s get everyone involved.</p><p><em>So
    there it is, just a couple of ways that PM’s can make a friendlier atmosphere
    for engineers. What are some ways that you go about creating a kickass culture
    for engineers?</em></p><p><em>Thanks for reading! I’m <a href="undefined">Jack

  :title: UX Design Across Different Cultures — Part 1
  :content: '<p>Culture Clash. Source: Pascal</p><p>The Internet makes the world smaller.
    You can make money or gain users outside of your demographic with a digital product
    or service easier than a physical business. Global businesses such as <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/amazon-china-localization">Amazon</a>,
    <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/tencent-indonesia-wechat">WeChat</a>, <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/youtube-indonesia-launch">Google</a>,

    many businesses neglect cultural differences and merely offer translations and
    a local domain.</p><p>Leaders in the UX industry, Elisa M. del Galdo, and Jakob
    Nielsen discuss in their book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/International-User-Interfaces-Elisa-Galdo/dp/0471149659/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1478580140&sr=1-1&keywords=International+User+Interfaces">International

    a product translated in ten to twenty different languages. Users also want a product
    that acknowledges their unique cultural characteristics and business practices.</h1></blockquote><p>There
    can be a huge difference between two cultures. Professor <a href="https://geert-hofstede.com/">Geert
    Hofstede</a> summarized 6 aspects in regards to cultural differences:</p><ul><li><p>Power

    avoidance</p></li><li><p>Long-term orientation</p></li><li><p>Indulgence</p></li></ul><p>To
    put this simply, an American user is different from a Taiwanese user, especially
    in individualism and long-term orientation.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2068/1*POi9OT3HAG-zkjUj6QsDWw.png"

    alt=""></p><p>Culture differences affect us who make digital products and service.
    Dianne Cyr, Associate Professor at Simon Fraser University:</p><blockquote><p>Culture
    affects Internet usage, e-commerce trust, information and communication technology
    adoption, Internet marketing, and website development.</p></blockquote><p>I have
    lived in 4 countries, 3 continents, and had the opportunities to design for users
    of Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Southeast Asia. In this article,
    I will share tips and tricks learned from designing for various cultures, and
    how to apply culture differences in user experience design.</p><h2>1. Address
    cultural characteristics</h2><p>Through projects of designing for different cultures,
    I learned to address cultural characteristics in my designs. Even though we are
    familiar with design patterns, it may surprise us when users of a different culture
    react to them in a way we didn’t expect.</p><h3>Dutch culture — pragmatic</h3><p>This
    is one of my first projects I worked on at <a href="http://travelbird.com">TravelBird</a>
    before I learned much about the Dutch culture.</p><p>This form asks for the user’s
    passport details so that we can book flights for the user. The issue was that
    a handful of users used their nicknames, shortened names, or initials, which we
    couldn’t use.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*eJNk9lHp7h-3q01OIEG47w.jpeg"
    alt="Warning for incorrect passport names"><em>Warning for incorrect passport
    names</em></p><p>Before my re-design, there was a small warning underneath the
    last name field. My assumption was that user missed reading the unnoticeable warning.
    So I added a passport icon and increased the prominence of the text.</p><p>The
    expanded bold text reads: <em>“Make sure your name matches the one in your passport.
    Married women must fill in their maiden name. An incorrect name on the ticket
    leads to refusal at the gate.”</em> I assumed that highlighting the consequences
    is serious enough to prevent users from making errors.</p><p>After a few weeks
    of implementing the change, there was not much improvement. Dutch users still
    filled in initials and nicknames instead of full names.</p><p><em>Why didn’t my
    design work on Dutch users?</em></p><p>According to Hofstede, Dutch culture is:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pragmatic</strong>
    nature</p></li><li><p>Encourage <strong>thrift</strong> and efforts in modern
    education as a way to prepare for the future</p></li><li><p>Strong propensity
    to <strong>save and invest</strong>, <strong>thriftiness</strong> and perseverance
    in achieving results</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4386/1*fiQdPWzCfAeE3hClS9t7SQ.jpeg"
    alt="Source: Transavia"><em>Source: Transavia</em></p><p>Due to Dutch people’s
    thrifty culture, money is a <strong>motivator</strong> and <strong>demotivator</strong>.
    In this example, Dutch airline Transavia uses a fine to demotivate Dutch users
    from filling in inaccurate passport names.</p><p>This pattern is also supported
    by the psychology of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion">loss
    aversion</a>, which infers penalizing unwanted behavior is more effective than
    rewarding wanted behavior.</p><p>Aurora Bedford, User Experience Specialist with
    Nielsen Norman Group:</p><blockquote><p>People avoid losses and optimize for sure
    wins because the pain of losing is greater than the satisfaction of an equivalent
    gain.</p></blockquote><p>With Dutch users’ pragmatic nature, I found that the
    loss aversion pattern works well on them.</p><p>After my first attempt on the
    passport data form, this user story fell off the priority list, so unfortunately,
    I didn’t iterate on my design. If I did, I would have tried a solution like this.</p><h3>German
    culture — precise</h3><p>I also learned a lot about German culture when I worked
    at TravelBird. According to Hofstede, I found that the following is true about
    German users:</p><blockquote><p>The systematic overview has to be given to proceed.
    Details are equally important to create certainty that a certain topic or project
    is well-thought-out.</p></blockquote><p>TravelBird offered travel services to
    17 countries and hired teams to localize content for each country. The flow is
    the same, but the details between each local website are different. For example,
    this is the first step in the checkout flow.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/11286/1*_T9X4HKKfLuFwPFPnzyvZg.jpeg"
    alt="TravelBird Netherlands v.s. TravelBird Germany"><em>TravelBird Netherlands
    v.s. TravelBird Germany</em></p><p>The example image above shows the difference
    between the Dutch site (left) and German site (right). The most obvious differences
    are the list of <strong>inclusive/exclusives</strong> and <strong>trust badges</strong>.</p><p>At
    one point we assumed that showing the excluded items demotivates users from booking.
    After an A/B test with and without the list of included and excluded items, we
    found the conversion rate on the German site with more information came out better
    than the conversion rate without.</p><p>German e-commerce sites use trust badges
    frequently. I would go so far as to say these are necessary. In my experiments,
    many German users are accustomed to judging a website’s trustworthiness by trust
    badges.</p><p>Another feature I worked on with TravelBird allows users to travel
    offers that are reachable by car, a common way of how German users prefer to travel.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3098/1*3616ea8tnlzfqYvu3QcjMw.jpeg" alt="Number
    of hours v.s. Kilometers driven"><em>Number of hours v.s. Kilometers driven</em></p><p>In
    the first iteration, I used the number of hours because it’s what I have in mind
    when I drive. I assumed it was also easier for users.</p><p>In a feedback session
    with German team managers, I found that in Germany, many people value the exact
    numbers. In this case, kilometers driven. With the driving speed varying greatly
    on German roads, the number of hours didn’t mean anything. With that insight,
    I learned to be more precise when I design for German users.</p><p>Through projects
    of designing for different cultures, I learned that cultural differences indeed
    affect us designers. These techniques helped me to address cultural characteristics
    in my designs: research and understanding users’ culture, local competitive analysis,
    design reviews with locals, and A/B testing.</p><h2>2. Conduct usability tests</h2><p>A
    usability test is an essential method to do user research. User research gives
    you insights that quantitative data can’t give you. For example, users’ needs,
    expectations, and explanation of their behaviors. These are things that you cannot
    get by looking at conversion rates.</p><p>If you can, conduct the tests in the
    same environment where users actually use your products/services.</p><p>In the
    words of Paul Graham:</p><blockquote><p>Go to where your users are</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Usability
    testing for Deskbookers</strong></h3><p><a href="http://deskbookers.com">Deskbookers</a>
    is an online marketplace for meeting rooms and co-working spaces. They are active
    in the Netherlands, UK, and Germany and wanted to expand in Europe.</p><p>My client
    had questions and assumptions about how people use the product, but couldn’t answer
    them based on only quantitative data. To solve this problem, I led and conducted
    usability tests.</p><p>I made a plan to conduct usability tests on potential and
    current users, recruited over 50 participants, and conducted usability tests on
    8 qualified participants of different nationalities.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4080/1*OvtdbpIQK3dPMUGkWLlcRg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The usability tests gave us valuable insights: critical pain points,
    use cases of when users would use Deskbookers, answers to questions like how far
    in advance users book a meeting room, not to mention many feature ideas.</p><h3>Internal
    usability testing at Gimmie</h3><p>In 2013, I led UX/UI design at <a href="http://gimmie.io">Gimmie</a>,
    a loyalty platform for digital publishers.</p><p>Gimmie had been using a B2B portal
    which lacked UI design, and I wanted to find the most serious pain points to address
    in the re-design.</p><p>I urged my team to conduct usability tests with our clients
    in the Philippines, but unfortunately we didn’t have the budget at that time.
    So I opted for remote tests, which I conducted on our remote team in the Philippines.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2752/1*lvoHanPxWVCIKDTuacHbHg.png" alt="Remote
    usability testing with Skype"><em>Remote usability testing with Skype</em></p><p>The
    takeaways from the test: two testers gave up on completing the task of downloading
    a report with certain parameters, so a new flow was necessary. Creating an event
    and rewarding points was easy but could use fewer steps in the flow.</p><p>Even
    though it was a small sample size, some tests are better than no tests at all.</p><h3>Remote
    usability testing</h3><p>The best way to conduct usability tests is to do it in-person,
    but sometimes it’s not possible with time or budget. The good news is, there are
    plenty of tools to conduct remote usability tests. The best way to leverage such
    tools is by choosing one that works with your demographics.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/1*8ul7thAWwQy-_ZP179vSOA.jpeg"
    alt="Source: [UXTesting](http://uxtesting.io)"><em>Source: <a href="http://uxtesting.io">UXTesting</a></em></p><p>If
    your users are based in Southeast Asia, <a href="http://netizentesting.com">Netizen
    Testing</a> based in Singapore recruits users from Singapore and Southeast Asia.
    If your users are in Europe, <a href="http://userzoom.com">Userzoom</a> based
    in the UK has test users in Germany, Spain and other countries. <a href="http://uxtesting.io">UXTesting</a>
    based in Taiwan and the U.S. has testers in the U.S., Canada, Taiwan, and India.</p><p><a
    href="http://usertesting.com">UserTesting</a> and a few others are based in the
    U.S. and I assume most of their test users are also from the U.S. If you’ve had
    any success with these apps for a demographic outside of North America, <a href="http://twitter.com/jennyshen">tweet</a>
    or <a href="mailto:jenny@jennyshen.com">email me</a> to let me know.</p><p>If
    you’re new to usability testing and want to learn how to conduct guerrilla usability
    tests, read my article on <a href="http://www.onextrapixel.com/2013/03/07/usability-testing-for-startups/">Usability
    Tests for Startups</a>.</p><h2>3. Measure Data</h2><p>Data is not only a tool
    for data scientists, but should be a tool for UX designers too. With data, designers
    can understand how users are using the products and services we design, and the
    impact of our designs.</p><p>Deskbookers saw low conversion rates on their German
    website and asked me to help them. We know there is a market in Germany because
    they made their sales over the phone, but there were no sales from the website.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*4R713fX5_FPD97Y7." alt="Old version
    of Deskbookers’ website. Source: Deskbookers"><em>Old version of Deskbookers’
    website. Source: Deskbookers</em></p><p>To improve conversion rates for Deskbookers,
    it was helpful utilizing Google Analytics, heat maps and recordings to understand
    where users dropped off and where they clicked.</p><p>I found high drop-offs on
    the homepage, with users frequently clicking on help and company-related links.
    To gain a better understanding, I also talked to the German sales team to gather
    feedback they’ve acquired from potential and actual customers.</p><p>Based on
    data and my understanding of German users, the website did not seem to provide
    enough or concise information for them to proceed. The website was also lacking
    trust or social proof for users to make a booking.</p><p>To address these concerns,
    we implemented the following:</p><ul><li><p>German customers in logo roster</p></li><li><p>Trust
    logos from trustshops.de</p></li><li><p>Customer reviews</p></li><li><p>Accepted
    payment methods</p></li><li><p>Short description about company in footer</p></li><li><p>More
    detailed copy</p></li></ul><p><strong>The revised design:</strong></p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5704/1*f0tz9ha-9GJmcZJYxTiOwQ.png" alt=""></p><p><em>I
    would love to share the results of the re-design, but unfortunately, the client
    decides to not share this data in public.</em></p><h2>4. Localize copy</h2><p>Languages
    are fascinating. Even for English, there are differences between American English,
    Canadian English, British English, and Australian English.</p><p>We shouldn’t
    translate content literally based on our own languages because elsewhere in the
    world may use a different term for the same thing. The most effective way to approach
    this is to localize copy for your users.</p><h3>Monthly accommodation</h3><p>In
    this client project for Monthly, I worked with a team of expats of different nationalities.
    While trying to optimize the copy, I learned that we used different terms for
    monthly accommodations.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5720/1*YivLk5DoQlxbofzoyZeRVg.png"
    alt="Source: [Monthly](https://www.monthly.com.br/)"><em>Source: <a href="https://www.monthly.com.br/">Monthly</a></em></p><p>In
    North America people may use “furnished apartment”, “temporary housing” and “vacation
    rental” for this. I learned from European colleagues that the terms “aparthotel”
    and “serviced apartment” are more common. Since Monthly offered accommodation
    for multiple countries from Brazil to Hong Kong, I optimized the copy based on
    the terms that are most commonly used for that country.</p><h3>Buy one get one
    free</h3><p>In North America, a promotion which you get a second item for free
    when you buy one item is often phrased as “buy one get one free” or BOGO.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XlfEh-z0D_jlcnaJsDvXkA.png" alt="North
    America v.s. the Philippines"><em>North America v.s. the Philippines</em></p><p>During
    a client project for SMART in the Philippines, the local PM corrected me of the
    phrase I used on this marketing graphic (left). I learned from her that in the
    Philippines, the phrase is “buy one <em>take</em> one”. The right image is the
    final design which aligns with how Filipinos understand the same promotion.</p><h3>Business
    cards — English to Chinese</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*F-AYONRjBp7O4eQCbUSgUw.jpeg"
    alt="English business cards v.s. Chinese business cards. Source: Dribbble"><em>English
    business cards v.s. Chinese business cards. Source: Dribbble</em></p><p>These
    business cards were made by a Dutch company for a meeting in China. The design
    and the intention to translate were good, but there is an issue in the translation,
    and the design did not adapt the content to local customs.</p><p>Unfortunately,
    the risk of not utilizing a local copywriter results in this:</p><ol><li><p>“Best
    from Amsterdam” translates to “better be from Amsterdam”.</p></li><li><p>His name
    in Chinese translates to Bert Ko.</p></li><li><p>To a foreigner, the Dutch number
    format is hard to read and may look like a string of random numbers.</p></li></ol><p>When
    writing copy for users of a different culture, it’s best to consult a local copywriter
    or someone who speaks the language. It’s easy and free to use Google Translate,
    but you probably shouldn’t use it to translate your product/service or anything
    related to doing business.</p><h3>Hire a local copywriter</h3><p>The best way
    to localize copy is to hire a local copywriter. Professional copywriters know
    how to write the most effective copy for your demographics and avoid cultural
    taboos.</p><p>In this article, I discussed four ways to design across different
    cultures: address cultural characteristics, conduct usability tests, measure data,
    and localize copy. In the <a href="https://medium.com/p/761c911e875">second part
    of the article</a>, I will share a few more examples and tips and tricks for designing
    user experience across cultures.</p><h3>Need cross-cultural UX design?</h3><p>I

    N.A.S.A.) at The Shelter, New York, 1995.</em></p><p>The first time Aaron Lee
    Fineman went to a rave, he knew he’d be returning with a camera. It was the summer
    of 1994 and the 18-year-old Georgia native had recently moved to New York City
    to start taking classes in photography. Over the years that followed he would
    repeatedly return to the scene, snapping black-and-white pics of a culture which
    for many young people represented pure freedom. “Nobody cared what you looked
    like or wore, people accepted you for who you were. That was part of the ‘respect’
    of P.L.U.R.” The acronym (short for ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLUR">Peace,
    Love, Unity, Respect</a>’) was a guiding philosophy for ravers at the time—a credo
    which reflected their shared ideals of musical and cultural camaraderie.</p><p>At
    the parties he photographed in New York, Baltimore, and back home in Marietta,
    Fineman was often the only person with a camera. Armed with a few rolls of film
    stuffed in his pockets—and the informal blessings of the DJs and promoters whom
    he befriended—he was allowed to shoot freely, connecting intimately with subjects
    in a scene of which he was also an earnest participant. He didn’t take drugs,
    but like many of his generation of ravers he had a genuine affection for the music
    and its transcendent potential.</p><p>Fineman kept shooting until the late ’90s
    when he started to see a shift in the rave scene. “The climate of the culture
    was changing, it wasn’t the same spirit as when I started. There started to be
    more emphasis on the drugs.” The photojournalist now laments that people have
    become much more sensitive about having cameras around. But in the pictures he
    made in those pre-selfie years of image indifference, we can feel the intensity—and
    integrity—of an underground movement with its own unique identity.</p><p>So kick
    back, throw on some <a href="https://soundcloud.com/djsoulslinger">Soul Slinger</a>,

  :title: How The Best Companies Build Their Cultures
  :content: '<p>Company culture: it’s one of the great, intangible mysteries of startup
    life. There is no formula, and it’s often difficult to point to a set of metrics
    that help you create and shape a happy, productive team. But, any successful founder
    will tell you that building a culture from day 1 is one of the most important
    things you can do to ensure the health and success company long-term.</p><p>Given
    the importance of company culture, it’s unsurprising that a number of our Product
    Hunt LIVE guests have shared their thoughts on the topic. We collected some of
    the most thought-provoking ideas from several successful entrepreneurs. Read on
    to learn more about how they built their company cultures from the ground up.</p><iframe

    important do you think it is to build a sense of culture early on? — <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/live/liz-wessel#comment-271916">Emily
    Hodgins</a></strong></p><p>I think every company inherently has a culture from
    day 1. It’s almost impossible not to. However, I do think it’s important to focus
    on building a positive culture that the founders are proud of from day 1. That
    being said, culture may change as the company grows, so I always encourage people
    to not try to create the company “values” until you’re at least a few employees
    in, and see which values you truly care most about. We tried coming up with values
    on day 1, and it was way harder than when we did it on day 240 (i.e. 8 months
    later, and 10 employees later), since we knew what things mattered most to us
    from the employees we had hired. <strong>— <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/live/liz-wessel">Liz

    is changing the way people work at Zappos? When is the best time for startups
    to embrace holacracy? — <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/live/tony-hsieh-justin-weniger#comment-271747">Kazuya
    Nakamura</a></strong></p><p>Holacracy just happens to be the technology that we
    are using today, but our ultimate goal is that we want to structure Zappos more
    like a city and less like a top-down bureaucratic command and control organization.
    Our march towards self-organization and self-management isn’t an experiment. It’s
    the future of work and it’s the only structure that has stood the test of time.
    It’s the only structure that can become more innovative as it gets bigger (vs.
    typical corporate structures that become less innovative as they get bigger).
    Self-organization and self-management isn’t a theory. It exists in nature, and
    it exists in human-created cities. </p><p>I don’t think there’s ever a good time
    to adopt holacracy. It’s a completely different mindset and way of thinking that
    will take time to learn. But I would say if you’re going to do it, you should
    do it as early as possible, as the transition later will only be harder the more
    employees you have. If I could do it all over again, I would have made the switch
    to holacracy sooner.** — <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/live/tony-hsieh-justin-weniger">Tony

    — <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/live/joel-gascoigne#comment-201012">Adhi</a>*</em>
    I didn’t know what culture and values were when I started Buffer. It’s something
    that I learned about over time. When we hit around 9 or 10 people at Buffer, I
    started to experience first-hand the impact of team dynamics. It was only then
    that I started to learn about company culture and tried to read as much as I could
    and watch presentations about it. By that point, a few parts of the culture had
    started to become clear: transparency, a focus on self-improvement, etc. But we
    hadn’t put this into words.</p><p>It was right around then that I watched an interview
    that Tony Hsieh from Zappos did. He was asked by the interviewer, “If you could
    go back and start Zappos again, what would you do differently?” Tony said that
    they had waited until they were more than 100 people before they put values into
    words and documented their company culture. If he were to start again, he’d do
    that from day 1. Zappos was the key company we looked up to for having such a
    strong company culture, so we had no choice: we had to put our values into words
    as soon as possible. After we did so, it really moved us from the company culture
    being ad-hoc and left to fate, to us deliberately shaping it.** — <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/live/joel-gascoigne">Joel

    — <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/live/tony-hsieh-justin-weniger#comment-271140">Kingsong
    Chen</a></strong></p><p>This is general advice for any startup: If you’re just
    starting out as a new company, then the easiest thing I would suggest is to figure
    out your own personal values (which is harder than it sounds) and then just make
    the company’s values the same as your personal values. Make sure you hire people
    whose values match the company’s values (and fire people for values violations).

    of impact? — <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/live/michael-slaby#comment-315884">Pablo
    Quiroga</a></strong></p><p>An essential pattern or maintaining culture is to talk
    about your values; to embrace your beliefs as a team with passion and intensity,
    and not be shy or cautious with them. Too often, we try to be all things to all
    people and while we treasure the diversity of our team [at Timshel] and strive
    to be inclusive about our ideas and perspectives, we have strong opinions about
    what matters, why we work, and what we’re here to do. Everyone seeks meaning and
    we’re trying to create a space where we can do world-class work in service of
    something greater than the work itself. <strong>— <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/live/michael-slaby">Michael

    you start defining what the culture at WayUp should look like? Do you see this
    changing as you grow? — <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/live/liz-wessel#comment-271873">Ali
    Afridi</a></strong></p><p>Our culture started getting created from day 1, when
    it was me and JJ working out of a library basement. When we had Nikki (our first
    team member!) join us, we knew that she would maintain the energy and enthusiasm
    about college students that keeps this company running. Every person we’ve hired
    since Nikki has been just as enthusiastic about our users and our mission, which
    allows us to keep our eyes on the prize. In terms of culture, I’d say the #1 thing
    you’d see at our company is that everyone is obsessed with learning and growing.
    Most people who do what they do at WayUp had little experience prior to joining
    the team (that includes me — I’m a first-time CEO), so that allows for us to be
    super scrappy and creative in everything we do, including building our culture.
    Plus, everyone who works at WayUp is smart (and fun!), so we tremendously enjoy
    one another’s company. <strong>— <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/live/liz-wessel">Liz

    Levy</a></strong></p><p>I think one of the most important things with company
    building, both in the early days and as it grows, is establishing a culture of
    trust. Generally, the best way to do this is by being as transparent and direct
    as possible (I think there is almost no upper limit on how transparent companies
    should be, except for a few HR-related issues). When people aren’t worried about
    whether or not they have complete information, they tend to focus more on their
    work and not about what they do or don’t know. <strong>— <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/live/jack-altman">Jack

    Hodgins</a></strong></p><p>A big problem is when tech companies align “culture”
    with performance. Many tech companies expect you to be in the office at all hours
    (even when you can do the work just as well from home), go out for company drinks,
    go on company trips, and other cultural things that can exclude pregnant and nursing
    women, parents, and others who just don’t prefer those activities. The more tech
    companies can separate participating in all of the “cultural” activities from
    actual work performance, the more parents will stay in tech and the more companies
    will benefit by rewarding tangible work performance. <strong>— <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/live/sara-mauskopf">Sara

    Hoover</a></strong></p><p>My biggest learning from growing LivingSocial from 4
    friends to four thousand people across 30 countries is the people and the culture
    matter more than the product you build. If you look at the history of LivingSocial,
    there were a dozen or so “companies” we built with the same team, each one succeeding

    mentioned, great culture-fit with our values. That is the hardest thing for us
    to find, and whilst skill/expertise is important, that is something we are less
    focused on than culture-fit, since we believe that is something that can be taught
    and practiced more so than culture-fit. The way we view the Buffer culture: We’re
    really looking for people who are already living their lives by [certain] values,
    and happen to find Buffer which aligns very well with their personal values. It’s
    a red flag for us if, during the first few weeks of someone joining the team,

    alt=""></p><p>I’ve spent the last 10+ years setting up design practices inside
    of cost centers. It’s my job to build product design teams, develop the practice
    of design, and integrate those teams into existing cultures within organizations
    where resources (headcount, money, etc.) are very limited. My experience has been
    inside enterprise organizations like Customer Experience (CX), R&amp;D, and IT.
    I believe this background provides a very unique perspective as to how environment
    shapes design.</p><p>I have never been in a position where I could declare culture
    change is going to happen. The only person who can attempt such a change is the
    big boss and <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1747593/risd-old-guard-clashes-its-tweeting-president-john-maeda">it

    and <a href="https://www.cooper.com/training/designing-culture">workshops</a>
    about developing healthy design practices and articulating the components that
    make up a healthy design culture. While many of these articles are relevant, smart,
    and helpful, they are primarily focused on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kYC1L_wCo">internal
    workings of a design team</a>. That’s one half of the equation. The other half
    is selling design to colleagues and peers on other teams.</p><p>The job scenario
    I’ve encountered time and time again is incorporating design into existing organizational
    cultures. Existing, long-in-the-tooth, and sometimes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality">Crab
    mentality</a> (“if I can’t have it, neither can you”) cultures. Integrating a
    successful design practice would be much easier if everyone cared about design,
    but not everyone does. It would be much easier if design was <a href="http://adaptivepath.org/ideas/user-experience-is-everyones-responsibility/">everyone’s
    responsibility</a>, but it’s usually not.</p><p>Products can be made without design
    teams. Products can not be made without engineering and development teams. Compared
    to the other functions within the software lifecycle (architecture, engineering,
    development, project management, etc.), design is still the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbIEwIwYz-c">new
    kid on the block</a>. It’s been my responsibility to introduce a new level of
    design standards, develop people, and incorporate good practices into an established
    process. I won’t beat around the bush. This shit is hard.</p><h2>What I’ve learned</h2><p>With
    that in mind, here are a few things I’ve found helpful for the other half of the
    equation; fitting design in with existing organizational cultures.</p><h3>1. Embrace
    the cultures around you</h3><p>The tech industry still does not know how to incorporate
    design into existing product, development, QA, and UAT processes. Culture is a
    manifestation of process. It’s on us, as designers and design leaders, <a href="https://twitter.com/miniver/status/772502149167144960">to
    do a better job of articulating how design should fit into organizations and greater
    processes</a>. I spend a lot of my time understanding the work of my peers. I
    aim to understand how they work and ensure my team is providing design assets
    in formats that fit their workflows.</p><ul><li><p>*<em>Understand how other people
    work. *</em>Do you know how QA teams work? What the UAT process is? Are your Dev
    teams filling design gaps by guessing what interactions should take place? Often,
    members of those teams are developing and testing around task-based flows because
    users will be encountering the same tasks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create understandable
    outputs.</strong> When providing design assets, the design team is providing them
    in a format understood by our counterparts. Here’s a storyboard format with specific
    screens of task-based flows.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*tD3OnHTMrrZ7Jzy7OKyq5Q.png"
    alt="Storyboards are great for task-based documentation"><em>Storyboards are great
    for task-based documentation</em></p><ul><li>*<em>Show clarity of intent. *</em>QA
    teams are testing for bugs. If they do not know an interaction is intentional,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undocumented_feature">they’ll assume it’s
    a bug</a>. Providing task-based flows allow teams testing a product to validate
    whether or not an application state is intended. When clarity of intent is understood
    up front, it reduces the amount of bugs created. It also reduces the amount of
    re-work design teams often do.</li></ul><h3>2. Sell something else</h3><p>My biggest
    takeaway from the last 10+ years? *<em>I sell design, but there are few colleagues
    buying design. Most are buying something else. *</em>I’m always adapting my approach.</p><p>I’ve
    spent countless minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years selling design.
    The need for it. The power of it. The risks of not haven’t it. While many colleagues,
    leaders, and peers have agreed with my selling points, no one has bought design
    for design’s sake. What they are buying are increased revenue, cost reductions,
    time savings, and user adoption.</p><p>Here’s an example of what I mean. <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/promoting-a-design-system-across-your-products">Design
    systems</a> are a valuable tool in providing holistic color, tone, layout, patterns,
    and brand across a portfolio of products. Here’s how I sell the value of having
    a design system:</p><ul><li><strong>Sell the merits of saving development time</strong>
    to Engineering and Development teams by using a design system. If it saves them
    time, they’ll use it.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9260/1*uRedRiDSQzMxtqRf3erxgQ.png"
    alt="Super awesome “Time is Pain” graphic created by friends [Little Thunder Co.](https://littlethunder.co/)"><em>Super
    awesome “Time is Pain” graphic created by friends <a href="https://littlethunder.co/">Little
    Thunder Co.</a></em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Sell the merits of reducing costs</strong>
    to our Leadership by reusing existing resources (headcount, markup, designs).
    If it saves them money, they’ll require teams to use it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sell
    the merits of user adoption</strong> to Product teams. After providing time and
    cost savings, showcase user <a href="https://library.gv.com/how-to-choose-the-right-ux-metrics-for-your-product-5f46359ab5be#.3hc84ksf6">adoption
    based on research and data</a>. If users are adopting the design, we’ll save more
    time and money in additional development.</p></li></ul><p>Figure out how to sell
    increased revenue, cost reductions, time savings, and user adoption, or whatever
    other derivative they’re buying and include your best design practices and processes
    into those. Don’t know where to start? Start with the past. <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/ux-team-of-one/ix-method-of-the-week-opportunity-workshop/">Investigate
    and understand</a> what is and isn’t working, and know what your peers are buying.</p><h3>3.
    Practice what you preach</h3><p>I like to leverage known design practices and
    use them as a means to solving “other” problems. For the most part, I act as facilitator
    to the events, meetings, workshops, etc. and invite others to join me.</p><ul><li><strong>Offer
    a crash course introducing fundamentals of design.</strong> This has been SO valuable
    for me. A couple years ago, I began offering a crash course teaching the fundamentals
    of design process, problem solving, prototyping, etc. I invite EVERYONE in the
    office to attend, buy pizza for lunch, and limit the seats to 12 people. I’ve
    always had full attendance and have had to book more than one crash course due
    to popularity. I run this course multiple times a year.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4096/1*fRGfjV7jK5VPEy1NhcIXXA.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><ul><li><p><strong>Organize and run hackathons.</strong> Colleagues
    love making things. If I provide attendees with some structure and time, wonderful
    things happen. Hackathons have had quite a positive side effect as well. They
    introduce a format that is not too different from a <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">Design
    Sprint</a>. Many attendees have asked me how they can incorporate hackathons into
    their daily work. I always offer to facilitate a Design Sprint. Which gets me
    to…</p></li><li><p>*<em>Facilitate workshops. *</em>When you’re a designer, people
    want your feedback. All the time. Instead of providing random, water cooler feedback,
    I offer my services in providing a one-day workshop. If I can convince colleagues
    to get into a room with me, facilitate structured activities of problem solving,
    they’re much more likely to ask for help earlier and more often. I am fortunate
    I can offer such time and am supported in doing so. I also ask for that support
    prior to taking any job.</p></li><li><p><strong>Start a speaker series.</strong>
    I’ve been fortunate enough to <a href="http://ryanrumsey.com/speaking/">speak
    often</a> and be part of the larger design community over the last few years.
    Being involved in the larger design community also means <a href="https://vimeo.com/157185375">I
    see</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qTxi2qHmpI">hear</a> a lot
    of <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/uxlausanne/stephen-anderson-hooked-on-a-feeling">amazing</a>
    stuff. When someone shares amazing things, I thank them and <a href="http://udanium.com/pro/home/">invite
    them to speak</a> (Thanks <a href="undefined">Uday</a>!) at my office. I invite
    EVERYONE to attend. I’ve never had a problem filling the room.</p></li><li><p><strong>Start
    a design critique and feedback meeting.</strong> I’ve invited all designers, regardless
    of what team they’re on, to attend a bi-weekly critique and feedback session.
    Designers spend a lot of time getting feedback like, “<a href="http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html">Why
    did you make it that shade of blue?</a>” By providing a safe space for critique,
    designers are able to 1. practice their presentations and 2. prepare answers for
    questions that might come. Want to know how to run these meetings? My friend <a
    href="undefined">Verne Ho</a> and his article, <a href="https://medium.com/shopify-ux/fresh-eyes-design-talks-ddecdb2cc237#.jh5doueku">Fresh
    Eyes &amp; Design Talks</a> is the perfect starting point.</p></li></ul><h3>4.
    Accept things won’t change</h3><p>“If only he wasn’t here, then things would be
    perfect.”</p><p>“Why are they doing that? They’re idiots!”</p><p>“If only they
    listened to me, we wouldn’t be in this situation.”</p><p>How often have you said
    something like this? How often do you hear something like this? There is an urge
    to make statements like this ALL THE TIME and it’s takes a tremendous amount of
    effort not to do so. Instead of fighting things out of my control, I ask myself
    a simple question:</p><blockquote><h1>If I accept that nothing will change, what
    will I do to be successful?</h1></blockquote><p>By asking this question, I am
    able to treat frustrations as design challenges. I am able to understand what
    is and isn’t a real constraint. I am able to keep my sanity when PEOPLE CONTINUE
    DOING THAT!!!</p><h3>5. Go for a walk</h3><p>No doubt, there will be moments you’re
    on the brink. Get up, shut up, and go for a walk. I have never been able to successfully
    sell design or integrate design culture in those moments. Go for a walk (it’s
    beautiful outside!), take a breath, and come back refreshed.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4096/1*IgCbcTGpUXrRKiDh-Qv8lw.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><h2>If you make good things, you’ll influence culture</h2><p>If you
    make good things, people will come. They won’t argue with your process. They won’t
    think you’re trying to change them. They’ll want to make good things with you.
    If culture is a manifestation of process, influencing the process of making good
    things, through design, will influence culture.</p><blockquote><p>Ray, people
    will come Ray. They’ll come to Iowa for reasons they can’t even fathom. They’ll
    turn up your driveway not knowing for sure why they’re doing it.— Terence Mann,
    Field of Dreams</p></blockquote><p>Design has become mainstream, or at least talking
    about design has. As a result, design is showing up in companies/teams/organizations
    where it has not traditionally played a role. As design continues to become more
    relevant, perhaps it’s inside these organizations where design can further establish
    itself as a fundamental partner to well known practices of development, engineering,
    quality assurance and testing. Environments where design culture can influence
    organizational culture. So far, it’s been working for me.</p>

    us.</p><p>So, you do a lot of work dealing with the pairing of Latin and Kanji
    lettering, and how you can translate the look and feel from one script to another.
    I’ll dive in to that in a moment, but before we do that, maybe you’d like to tell
    our readers a bit about yourself and where your interest in type stems from?</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*5wSkdl5b1G3i_96YqV92vA.jpeg" alt="Tien-Min
    Liao"><em>Tien-Min Liao</em></p><p>*<em>Tien-Min Liao: *</em>Thanks Ulrik!</p><p>OK,
    I am originally from Taipei, Taiwan. I came to New York to study graphic design
    after graduating from college in Taipei and now I am working in a branding agency
    called Siegel+Gale where I have had the chance to work on a lot logotype development
    and refinement projects, which is part of where I am coming from with my bilingual
    type studies.</p><p>I got in to typeface design while taking one of Jesse Ragan’s
    typeface design workshops at Pratt. And then a year later I got in to the Type@Cooper
    program, while still working at S+G.</p><blockquote><h1>After working in a branding
    agency for a while, and traveling between US, Taiwan and China, I started to notice
    that a lot of western brands didn’t make their Chinese/Kanji version logotypes
    as good as their original logotype and vice versa.</h1></blockquote><p>*<em>Ulrik:
    *</em>So what was it that drew you to type design?</p><p><strong>Tien-Min:</strong>
    I remember when I was in middle school, I was fascinated by the custom logotypes
    for these Taiwanese pop artist’s album designs. That was the first time I noticed
    how much personality type can bring into a design. But before I took those typeface
    design classes with Jesse, I didn’t know much about the difference between things
    like typeface design and lettering.</p><p>*<em>Ulrik: *</em>Cool, and what was
    the experience like at Cooper? Especially working on the side? Was it a tough
    period, or was it nice to have job on the side where you could apply your learning?</p><p>*<em>Tien-Min:
    *</em>I was very busy at the time, working during the day and taking classes at
    night and on the weekend. The workload was pretty heavy, but I enjoyed it a lot!
    After I graduated from the program the first time, I went back to take the program
    again (most of the classes that is. I did miss a few…) but this time with different
    instructors. I felt like one year was not enough — and it was really fun to take
    it with a new set of instructors. Really, for me the first year was just the beginning
    —and after I finished the second year I felt more comfortable in terms of making
    my own design decisions when working with type — and at the same time I started
    to have more opportunity to work on some logotype refinements at S+G which also
    grew my confidence.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5678/1*Bzebrwxh8p1x44VnbxI3jg.png"

    Sans — Tien-Min’s project on her second year of Type@Cooper</em></p><p>*<em>Ulrik:
    *</em>Wow! You took the course twice! That’s dedication. Right, so let’s talk
    a bit about your work in bilingual lettering. Can you explain the project to our
    readers?</p><p><strong>Tien-Min:</strong> Well the project is a series of Latin-Kanji
    pairing studies for use in bilingual lettering and logotypes. I’ve also written
    some essays on my observations, process and synthesis, and documented all of it
    on my site.</p><p>*<em>Ulrik: *</em>Right, and I stumbled across it on your Instagram
    which I have been following for a while now and really find the work interesting.
    So tell me, what is the problem you are trying to solve with the project?</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2736/1*AQP6GRQBOjP62VtEWMQYZA.png" alt="The
    logo for the Typeji project; the two logos share the same personality, elements
    and meaning."><em>The logo for the Typeji project; the two logos share the same
    personality, elements and meaning.</em></p><p><strong>Tien-Min:</strong> Wow,
    thank you! After working in a branding agency for a while, and traveling between
    US, Taiwan and China, I started to notice that a lot of western brands didn’t
    make their Chinese/Kanji version logotypes as good as their original logotype
    and vice versa.</p><p>What people usually do is they choose an existing typeface
    (mostly a generic one) to pair with their original logo. So a Latin logotype gets
    a generic Kanji script and vice versa. However, this kind of treatment works only
    when both languages appear at the same time, When the translated logo stands by
    itself, the brand personality is typically not present at all because all you
    are seeing is the generic. It’s not designed to be a logotype. The other common
    thing that I often see is that even when someone has gone through the effort to
    draw a translated logotype, it is often badly drawn by designers who are not familiar
    with typeface design. For example, I often see wrong thick-and-thin strokes in
    Latin or Kanji logotypes respectively. So I was wondering if there is way to make
    both languages or scripts work together and be able to express a common personality
    at the same time. And that is really why I started this project.</p><p>*<em>Ulrik:
    *</em>That’s really interesting. I hadn’t really thought of that being mainly
    familiar with Latin script — but it makes sense. And of course, I am aware that
    companies like Toyota or VW are investing in families of typefaces across Latin,
    cyrillic and Kanji, so what you are saying explains a lot about the motivations
    for those companies to want a consistent brand across cultures.</p><p>So tell
    me a little about the differences in designing Latin script and Kanji?</p><p><strong>Tien-Min:</strong>
    Yes, some big corporates have the budget to invest in multi-language typefaces
    for use in throughout in their brand’s visual identity. But for most of the clients,
    although it might be hard for them to do custom typeface, I think at least they
    should be trying to customise their logotype.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/1*yWWCCFXiHY7Mq2hQ8xpZ7A.jpeg"
    alt="Tien-Min’s sketches for her type explorations"><em>Tien-Min’s sketches for
    her type explorations</em></p><p>When it comes to Kanji and Latin, the two scripts
    are really different in terms of structure and the density. As a script they can
    both can be divided into smaller units, but the way those units are put together
    is totally different. Latin script is arranged horizontally while every Kanji
    characters is built differently. Some are built with two units—one on top of the
    other—some are set side by side, while some are built with multiple units, so
    the density between each character varies. Compared to Kanji, Latin script looks
    relatively even.</p><p>*<em>Ulrik: *</em>Right, and am I correct in thinking there
    is a somewhat limited amount of Kanji typefaces to choose from as well — I think
    someone was telling me that because of the huge character sets, it’s relatively
    expensive to design a Kanji typeface?</p><p><strong>Tien-Min:</strong> That’s
    true. There are not as many typefaces in Chinese or Japanese compared to Latin
    typefaces, but because of this fact, I think this should spur people on even more
    to do custom logotypes in Kanji.</p><p>*<em>Ulrik: *</em>Tell me a little bit
    about your process? How do you go about creating your pairings?</p><p><strong>Tien-Min:</strong>
    I usually start with one script and sketch it on paper first. At first, there
    was a lot of failure trying too hard to force logotypes to have the same appearance.
    But it’s hard—traditionally Latin and Kanji are drawn with different tools so
    there are differing weight distribution rules that need to be followed. However
    after doing around 50 exercises, I started to figure out a systematic way to do
    it.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7536/1*7tfH9nAQyzpN-3cnB1Mjgg.png"
    alt="Left; Using the typeface’s features as decorative elements. Right; imagining
    that both are drawn with the same tool."><em>Left; Using the typeface’s features
    as decorative elements. Right; imagining that both are drawn with the same tool.</em></p><p>I
    use three methods to create complimentary styles. The first one is to create the
    structure based on traditional weight distribution and then extracting the traits
    from the other script as decorative element.</p><p>The second one is to imagine
    they are drawn with the same tools. However, this kind of treatment often makes
    the type look informal or a bit too stylised.</p><p>The last one is totally illustrative.
    Treating both as images and creating a more expressive lettering or logotype.
    Which one is the better approach really depends on the design subject. After deciding
    which approach to use, the next step is to make sure they are consistent in all
    visual parameters, such as color, tension, balance, contrast and so on.</p><blockquote><h1>For
    instance, Li-shu is one kind of calligraphy style; it was often found carved on
    stone from the Han Dynasty, so it is usually used to express seriousness, but
    it may also make things feel a bit old.</h1></blockquote><p>*<em>Ulrik: *</em>That’s
    a great approach. I think I’ve also read you saying that it’s not just making
    the Latin script and Kanji look the same, but also having them express the same
    thing across cultures? So if a logotype is meant to look modern and forceful in
    Latin, then the Kanji should echo that too? Is that always easy to do?</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*1eOpPv_uUMgOeTEmaNDwzw.png" alt="Various
    pairing examples"><em>Various pairing examples</em></p><p><strong>Tien-Min:</strong>
    Yes. I think they should express the same personality. I feel one must have cultural
    knowledge of both scripts to do bilingual lettering well and to really understand
    the cultural cues. For instance, Li-shu is one kind of calligraphy style; it was
    often found carved on stone from the Han Dynasty, so it is usually used to express
    seriousness, but it may also make things feel a bit old.</p><p>*<em>Ulrik: *</em>That’s
    fascinating — is it a stupid question to ask how many calligraphic styles there
    are? And how are they used? Do people change between them depending on what they
    are writing or… Is it like as a westerner I might choose a more severe serif if
    it needs to look serious, a lighter sans if it needs to look more modern?</p><p><strong>Tien-Min:</strong>
    There are five big categories in terms of calligraphy. It’s hard to say which
    one is more modern. Sometimes it also depends on how they are drawn. It’s like
    blackletter can be used in both old and modern ways. Apart from calligraphy, there
    are also many different typeface catalogues like Song-ti, Hei-ti and and so on,
    just like Latin typefaces.</p><p>*<em>Ulrik: *</em>Got it. Ok, so if I am a type
    or graphic designer and want to learn more, how do I do it? Where do I start?</p><p><strong>Tien-Min:</strong>
    I am not sure… most of the Kanji type design books and magazines are published
    in Japanese or Chinese. I haven’t seen a book or tutorial in English yet. If you
    are interested I have some very basic info on my site, although that is probably
    not enough…</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/1*rf71YPye3WXd0yrWb21bAQ.png"

    *</em>Ha, yes — I was reading through some of that earlier on. It’s a nice primer
    though. However, sounds like there is a gap in the market for a book or instructional
    series — a project for you perhaps?</p><p><strong>Tien-Min:</strong> Haha, maybe
    I can translate some really good books into English in the future if people are
    interested.</p><p>*<em>Ulrik: *</em>That sounds like a great idea! In the meantime,
    thank you so much for your time. I’ll look out for the book and in the meantime,
    I’ll follow along on your website and Instagram.</p><p>Best of luck in the future!</p><p><strong>Tien-Min:</strong>

  :title: How to use design thinking to change cultures.
  :content: '<p>This how-to article aims to provide a very effective process to change
    an organisation’s culture: from traditional (point A “Don’t know” or “Could be”),
    to responsive organisations (point B — “Do know” or “Should be”), where <strong>the
    culture</strong> helps to foster innovation and creativity.</p><h2><strong>Can
    we change a company culture?</strong></h2><p>During my six months researching
    this question for my MA thesis at <a href="undefined">Hyper Island</a>, there
    was a common perspective from all of the industry leaders I talked to. If I could
    synthesize all their answers into one it would be something like:</p><blockquote><h1>“Yes,
    but don’t ask me how”</h1></blockquote><p>The <strong>how</strong> is the tricky
    part. Changing cultures is possible, but it’s also a pretty hard job.</p><p>I
    talked with lots of entrepreneurial minds who all had the same extreme difficulty
    in changing their company cultures. I attended many workshops that all seemed
    to suggested the same tools for every case. There was nothing that quite did the
    job. So I’ve designed an unique solution, that is genuine in its approach of responding
    not with a fix answer, but with a unique perspective for every set of cultural
    challenges.</p><p>Therefore, if you are a designer, project manager, change management
    agent or entrepreneur and want to transform your company culture to achieve its
    full potential of it: this solution is for you.</p><h2>The diamond crisis</h2><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3000/1*BGkXf_TpaBglpDyRHwmoAA.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>One
    of my uncles is a diamond expert. I was curious to understand more about his 50
    years working with this precious rock. After a while the wise man told me that
    it used to take thousands of years of temperature and soil pressure to create
    a small piece of diamond. Nowadays with the improvement of technology, machines
    can simulate similar ground pressure and temperature and create a diamond in few
    hours, which is leading to a total disruption of the diamond market.</p><p>The
    famous double diamond tool (developed by IDEO and further adapted by my friend
    <a href="undefined">Dan Nessler</a> in his article <a href="https://medium.com/digital-experience-design/how-to-apply-a-design-thinking-hcd-ux-or-any-creative-process-from-scratch-b8786efbf812#.9uci3fsfx">“How
    to apply a design thinking, HCD, UX or any creative process from scratch”</a>)
    for me presents a clear analogy to the real diamond market.</p><p>In the previous
    century it use to take many many years to develop a design solution. But today,
    thousands of new creative inventions are developed everyday. In this case, the
    machines and soil pressure are tools and processes used by creative people to
    develop new solutions. The double diamond is one of them (for me the most effective
    one) which can be understood as a visual space where we can simulate human conditions.
    We can do this to create the most precious of all human endeavours: a creative
    output.</p><p>In short, we no longer need to spend years developing something
    precious. We can make diamonds overnight.</p><p>Therefore, the solution presented
    here is a mixture of this effective and popular tool, combined with the demands
    of the challenging job of <strong>changing organisations</strong>.</p><p><img

    does it work?</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*aFZgboKPAfNFgn1H5l6rZw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The double diamond is divided in four activities.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Discover
    /Engagement</strong> — insight into the problem (diverging)</p></li><li><p><strong>Define/Synthesis</strong>
    — the area to focus upon (converging)</p></li><li><p><strong>Develop/ Ideation</strong>
    — potential solutions (diverging)</p></li><li><p><strong>Deliver /Implementation</strong>
    — solutions that work (converging)</p><blockquote><h1>“Phases of this process
    are either <strong>diverging or converging</strong>. During a <strong>diverging
    phase</strong>, you try to <strong>open up</strong> as much as possible without
    limiting yourself, whereas a <strong>converging phase</strong> focuses on <strong>condensing
    and narrowing</strong> your findings or ideas.” Dan Nassler</h1></blockquote></li></ol><p>Is
    also possible to narrow down this division to two phases, or two diamonds. Which
    is what we are going to do in this article to better explain the tool.</p><h3><strong>Diamond

    challenge, living the culture at the deepest level.</p><h3><strong>Diamond 2 —
    Designing things right</strong></h3><p>Getting your hands dirty by implementing
    the most effective solution for every scenario.</p><h2>Diamond 1 — Designing the

    alt=""></p><h3>Get in the Slum</h3><p>The idea of this part is to really <strong>immerse</strong>
    yourself to the reality of the <strong>culture</strong> you want to improve. If
    you wanted to do an in-depth study on the Brazilian slums, would you just use
    Google and Wikipedia, or live for one week in the Favelas?</p><p>When I was in
    this phase, working for a 300-employee company in Brazil, what I did was to select
    <strong>key people</strong> from different departments, areas and hierarchical
    positions in the company. That way it was possible to have a general vision and
    find patterns from their perspective on the organisation.</p><p>More than understanding
    the people in the company, doing <strong>primary research,</strong> it is also
    important to gather new ideas from <strong>secondary research</strong> outside
    the culture, to get a fresh view on cultural aspects.</p><p>Finally, in his book
    ‘The Power of Habit’, Charles Duhigg, when explaining how to understand a company
    culture, asked us to reflect on this situation. In my words it goes like this:</p><p>Imagine
    it is your first day in a company, when you get to your table, if you are lucky,
    you might see an on-boarding handbook with all the information you need to know.
    It doesn’t take a long time to realise that this information is almost useless.</p><p>Now,
    imagine a person who has worked there for quite a while, comes to you and tells
    you what you really need to know: who are the key people in the company, with
    who you need to talk to get your job done, who you can trust, how you should behave.
    What will you choose, the handbook or the person’s experience?</p><h3>The Challenge</h3><p>After
    deepen yourself in the discovery part, one idea is to ask the following question:</p><blockquote><h1><strong><em>What
    is the strongest cultural barrier that is holding back innovation in the organisation?</em></strong></h1></blockquote><p>Using
    the knowledge of the first phase of your Double Diamond, you can try to answer
    this question to understand what is holding back innovation in that culture. This
    is a fundamental question to reflect upon, as innovation is deemed to be one of
    the most important aspects of sustainable cultures. Then is it possible to use
    the** insights <strong>of your research to define a **“how might we”</strong>
    question.</p><p>For example: in the case of the company I’ve worked with, their
    problem was a lack of empathy between teams (this was the <strong>cultural barrier
    holding back innovation</strong>). One of the insights was that their company
    was very traditional in its structure (<strong>insight</strong>). Then I came
    up with the question, <em>How might we create empathy in traditional organisations
    to foster innovation?</em> (<strong>HMW question</strong>).</p><h2>Diamond 2 —

    alt=""></p><h3>I’m sorry, it’s not your idea</h3><p>For a sustainable transformation
    to be successful in any environment, where people can be confident rather than
    insecure about the change process, people must be the central part of this change.
    They need to be involved in the creation of change, and in leading it. When I
    discovered this secret during my research, things became much more easy and fun.</p><p>When
    developing a tool, development program, workshop, or anything which leads to a
    cultural shift (based on the HMW question), the secret is to let people lead this
    change. Therefore, one fundamental part of the shift process is to <strong>co-create</strong>
    it with the people from that specific culture.</p><blockquote><h1>“Tell me and
    I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.” Benjamin Franklin.</h1></blockquote><h3>Culture
    and strategy are friends, not food</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2932/1*JeCPhBSUMU16SSeYZFXmXQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Since the publication of his book, Peter Drucker’s statement that
    <em>“culture eats strategy for breakfast</em>” became very famous. During my MA
    project I was so obsessed with this thought that I completely dismissed strategy
    at the beginning.</p><p>Until one day when I was having a coffee in the back of
    the office and one of the members of the company approached me saying <em>“We
    are missing something here, I don’t feel we are working towards something.”</em>
    That was when I realised that <strong>strategy</strong> was missing.</p><p>Working
    with culture is a great and fulfilling job, but working with culture and forgetting
    the <strong>strategy *<em>is like swimming in a calm river without having a boat.
    For a while it can work, but when the river gets messy the swimmers will drown.
    Therefore in this part of the Double Diamond it’s time to adapt *</em>the strategy
    that can fit properly with this new culture.</strong></p><h3>Vision, Small Wins
    and creating Momentum</h3><p>After defining the strategy it is time to implement
    the ideas co-created with the members of your culture. Try small but powerful
    words which can help as both motivational and measurable aspects of the success
    or failures of your attempts. The key here is to learn from it and keep on improving
    your new processes.</p><p><strong>Vision:</strong> What do we, as a group, really
    want to achieve? This for me is the special secret to engage people to be the
    central part of any transformation.</p><p><strong>Small wins:</strong> <em>“Small
    wins fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into patterns that
    convince people that bigger achievements are within reach.” Charles Duhigg.</em>
    Be calm. Cultural transformation is a hardcore training for your psychological
    capability of being patient. Focus on simple things that in the long run can make
    a huge impact.</p><p>For example: look to implement an idea in one small team,
    instead of in the entire organisation at once.</p><p><strong>Momentum:</strong>
    A fancy word for innovation. When I was interviewing a <a href="https://www.30weeks.com/">Google
    30 Weeks</a> program leader she told me <em>“I think that the biggest problem
    is, people are like, ‘I am so excited about innovation’, but they don’t know what
    it means, and the fear is that they don’t know what it is, and when they don’t
    know what it is, they get nervous.”</em> Creating momentum after every small win
    and holding on to that momentum, getting feedback on it, learning from it and
    improving it to achieve other small wins in this phase of the diamond is fundamental.</p><h3>Spread
    the word</h3><p><strong>Scaling</strong> is the last but not least part of the
    process. Many articles and books have been written about this part of the cultural
    process, and it is also a focus of attention for lots of experts, so I will not
    detail the process. Scale means spreading the culture to the entire organisation
    in a sustainable manner. That’s the last part of our work, and the last part of
    the double diamond.</p><h2>One last thing</h2><p>The double diamond is proven
    to be a powerful tool for developing creative work. This to-do article does not
    get into the specific “small tools” and methods that can be used to facilitate
    the process. It has been more focused on the general approaches one can take when
    facing a challenge like <strong>redesigning an organisational culture</strong>.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3000/1*sb1vaI7lzUXXnxo6eZ6URw.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>Finally,
    this is far from being a fixed solution. On the contrary, it is a framework that
    has guided me through my projects and has helped me to redesign organisations.
    I would love to see the complex process broken down and co-created with other
    people, so that together we can quietly and patiently contemplate the joy of our
    collective souls: <strong>our organisations</strong>.</p>'

  :title: Thoughts on the Two Cultures of Statistical Modeling
  :content: '<p>Thoughts on the Two Cultures of Statistical Modeling</p><h3>Accuracy
    beats interpretability and other takeaways from “Statistical Modeling: The Two
    Cultures” by Leo Breiman</h3><p>In the paper: <a href="http://www2.math.uu.se/%7Ethulin/mm/breiman.pdf">“Statistical
    Modeling: The Two Cultures”</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mXSv_1UAAAAJ&hl=en">Leo
    Breiman </a>— developer of the <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/%7Ebreiman/randomforest2001.pdf">random
    forest</a> as well as <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/%7Ebreiman/bagging.pdf">bagging</a>
    and <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/814c/f172298d11db0ac9b839440ed8f3db93e438.pdf">boosted</a>
    ensembles — describes two contrasting approaches to modeling in statistics:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Data
    Modeling:</strong> choose a simple (linear) model based on intuition about the
    data-generating mechanism. Emphasis is on model interpretability and validation,
    if done at all, is done through goodness-of-fit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Algorithmic
    Modeling:</strong> choose the model with the highest predictive validation accuracy
    with no consideration for model explainability.</p></li></ol><p>At the time of
    writing in 2001, Breiman estimated 98% of statisticians were in the data modeling
    group while 2% (himself included) were in the algorithmic modeling culture. The
    paper is written as a call to arms for statisticians to stop relying solely on
    data modeling — which leads to “misleading conclusions” and “irrelevant theory”
    — and embrace algorithmic modeling to solve novel real-world problems arising
    from massive data sets. Breiman was an academic, working as a statistician at
    Berkely for 21 years, but he had previously worked for 13 years as a freelance
    consultant giving him a well-formed perspective on how statistics can be useful
    in industry.</p><p>Breiman was frustrated because he knew data models were not
    up to solving new challenges from large-scale data collection and he felt academic
    statistics was becoming irrelevant by refusing to adopt new tools: complex algorithms
    with high predictive performance but low explainability. While machine learning
    and statistics have changed in the 18 years since the paper (I don’t know if the
    98/2 split still holds), several interesting points brought up are still relevant
    to practicing machine learning today particularly for those making the transition
    from academia to industry. Among the takeaways are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Models
    with different features often yield similar predictive accuracy.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>There
    is a trade-off in machine learning between model interpretability and performance.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>More
    features can improve the performance of complex algorithmic models.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Science
    evolves from simple models to complex models as we gather more information about
    the world.</strong></p></li></ol><p>The overall lesson from the paper is in line
    with what I’ve learned applying machine learning in industry (at <a href="https://cortexintel.com">Cortex
    Building Intelligence</a>): <strong>focus first on model accuracy, and only after
    building a high-performance model think about explaining it.</strong> A highly-complex,
    accurate model that can’t be fully explained is more valuable than a simple, linear
    model with no predictive accuracy that we completely understand.</p><p>Following
    are some of my thoughts on Breiman’s paper. Keep in mind, these are based on much
    less experience — 1 year in an academic setting (2018) and just over 1 year in
    industry (2018-present) — than Breiman was writing with. I’d recommend <a href="http://www2.math.uu.se/%7Ethulin/mm/breiman.pdf">reading
    the article </a>(and the criticism it includes) to form your own opinions. Feel
    free to add comments or experiences about the paper or associated topics in machine
    learning to this article. Although machine learning may seem to be moving incredibly
    quickly, <em>there is still valuable information to learn from older papers and
    books</em>, especially those written by a figure such as Breiman, who played a
    pivotal role in shaping the field.</p><h2>The Two Approaches to Statistical Modeling</h2><p>Before
    we can discuss what makes a good model, we have to understand the 2 goals of <a
    href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS3RA7_17.0.0/clementine/nodes_statisticalmodels.html">modeling</a>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Prediction:</strong>
    estimate the outcome (target) from a new set of independent variables (features)</p></li><li><p><strong>Information:</strong>
    learn something about nature (the data-generating) process</p></li></ol><p>The
    exact balance of these two objectives is situationally dependent: if you’re trying
    to predict stocks, you might only care if the model is accurate. In a medical
    setting, learning about the causes of a disease may be the main focus of building
    a model. Breiman makes the case that the algorithmic approach actually has the
    upper hand over the data modeling approach for both goals.</p><h3>Data Modeling</h3><p>A
    researcher using a data modeling approach (Breiman considers data models to be
    linear regression for regression and discriminant analysis or logistic regression
    for classification) first constructs a plausible mechanism for how the data is
    generated. That is, the researcher thinks up a linear equation relating the independent
    variables (features) to the dependent variables (target) from intuition, experience,
    or domain knowledge.</p><p>The coefficients in the model (feature weights) are
    found by fitting it to the dataset. The resulting linear equation represents the
    actual data-generating mechanism — the black box through which nature produces
    the dependent and independent variable values. The coefficients are used as a
    measure of variable importance, showing the effect of a feature on the response.</p><p>Validation,
    if it occurs at all, in data modeling is done by goodness-of-fit measures such
    as R² or residual analysis — both measured on the training dataset. Little thought
    is given to predictive accuracy. Instead, the emphasis is on how well the model
    explains the phenomenon under study. If the p-values on the coefficients are low
    enough, then they are “significant” and the model “becomes truth” in Breiman’s
    words with any conclusions made from the model infallible. The whole process is
    guided by intuition and subjective decisions: instead of letting the data speak,
    the researchers impose their own personal theories through choices such as which
    features to use and which data points to throw out as outliers.</p><p>Breiman
    quotes a textbook by Mosteller and Tukey to summarize his disappointment with
    data modeling: “The whole area of guided regression is fraught with intellectual,
    statistical, computational, and subject matter difficulties.” In other words,
    data modeling with simple linear models and intuition is not an objective way
    to learn from data. Yet, this is the approach taken by 98% of academic statisticians
    according to Breiman! It’s no wonder he was frustrated with his own field.</p><h3>Algorithmic
    Modeling</h3><p>The algorithmic modeling approach revolves around one concern:
    what is the performance of a model on the validation data? For choosing a model,
    there is no consideration for whether the model represents the underlying mechanism
    generating the data, only on whether the model can make reliable estimates on
    new (or hold-out) observations. Breiman credits the rise of the algorithmic culture
    to the invention of new algorithms such as the random forest (his own work), support
    vector machine, and neural nets. These are all models that — at least at the time
    — were not well-understood theoretically, but yielded extraordinary predictive
    accuracy, particularly on large datasets.</p><p>A central idea in the algorithmic
    community is that nature is a black-box, and our models are also a <a href="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/22335/why-are-machine-learning-models-called-black-boxes">black
    box</a>, although one that can give us predictions on new observations. There
    is little use trying to explain a model that is not accurate, so concentrate primarily
    on building the model with the greatest performance before focusing on learning
    anything about nature from it. An accurate model, no matter how complex, is more
    useful for both prediction (clearly) and for information gathering, because a
    simple, interpretable model with low accuracy is not capturing anything useful
    about the problem.</p><p>The algorithmic culture did not grow out of academic
    statistics, but rather from “young computer scientists, physicists, and engineers
    plus a few aging statisticians.” In other words, people who weren’t afraid to
    adopt or even invent new techniques for solving novel problems. These were the
    practitioners rather than the theorists, and they were using neural nets and random
    forests to solve problems across domains from medicine to genomics to stock markets
    to astronomy.</p><p>From his time as a consultant, Breiman saw the value of algorithmic
    modeling, adopting the best tool to solve the problem. He came to see computers
    as an invaluable tool because of their ability to apply complex techniques to
    large quantities of data. Upon returning to academia, he was disappointed by the
    reliance on data models and the lack of emphasis on predictive accuracy. Even
    if your primary goal is to extract information about nature through modeling,
    the first priority should be accuracy. A complex, accurate model can teach us
    about the problem domain because it must have captured some part of the relationship
    between features and target. Additionally, the algorithmic modeling community
    has made several interesting discoveries simply through solving problems.</p><h3>1.
    The Multiplicity of Models: many models with different sets of features have nearly
    the same predictive accuracy</h3><p>The first few models I built on the job, I
    was troubled by a recurring pattern. I was trying to select the “best” features
    by measuring validation scores, but, every time I would try a different subset,
    the overall validation score would stay nearly the same. This was puzzling but
    occurred repeatedly: varying the features and even trying different values for
    hyperparameters yielded similar performance. Breiman says that this is nothing
    to be worried about: for most problems, when using complex models, there are many
    features and hyperparameters that give roughly the same performance. In other
    words, the idea of a single best model is a fiction so we shouldn’t worry about
    finding it.</p><p>While this shouldn’t be a concern for algorithmic models, it
    raises unsettling questions for anyone relying on data models. Because simple
    linear models cannot deal well with many features, they require extensive feature
    selection, usually by a combination of intuition and formal methods. The mapping
    from features to targets created by choosing the features and calculating coefficients
    through fitting is assumed to represent ground truth, the data-generating process.
    However, if there are actually many sets of features that will give the same performance,
    then how can just one be the ultimate source of truth? In reality, there are many
    equally good models, so choosing only one is not accurately representing the problem.</p><p>What
    causes the multiplicity of models? My own experience from building models tells
    me it’s due to correlated features (two variables are positively correlated when
    they increase or decrease together). Although linear regression assumes input
    variables are independent, in real-world datasets, almost all features have some
    degree of correlation, often quite high. Thus, one feature can substitute for
    another in a model with no drop in accuracy. Building a single data model and
    calling it the source of truth misses all the other models that would perform
    just as well. Algorithmic modelers shouldn’t worry about selecting features: just
    give them all to your random forest and let it figure out which ones matter. After
    training, recognize that the fit model is only one possible representation of
    the mapping from features to targets.</p><h3>2. The Machine Learning Trade-off:
    simplicity and accuracy</h3><p>This is one area where the paper (again from 2001)
    shows its age. Breiman makes the common claim that the more complex machine learning
    models are completely unexplainable (particularly random forests and neural networks).
    When choosing a model, he says that we always have to trade interpretability for
    increased accuracy. However, the past few years have seen major strides in explaining
    complex models, particularly <a href="https://github.com/slundberg/shap/tree/master/shap">SHAP
    values</a> and <a href="https://github.com/marcotcr/lime">Local Interpretable
    Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME)</a>. These operate on the general principle
    of building a complex model, then explaining a small part of it (local) using
    a simpler model such as linear regression.</p><p>(For a class on interpretable
    machine learning, see <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning-explainability">Machine
    Learning Explainability from Kaggle</a>).</p><p>These model-interpretation techniques
    can work with any model, from random forests to neural networks and provide reasonable
    interpretations of individual model predictions. At Cortex, we use SHAP values
    to explain our estimates for the ideal time for buildings to start their HVAC
    (heating or air conditioning). We have seen high adoption of our recommendations,
    in part from these easy to understand explanations.</p><p>Breiman’s concerns about
    lack of explainability were valid, but, just as new algorithms were invented to
    handle larger datasets, new techniques were developed to peer into complex black-box
    machine learning models. It was a matter of the algorithms being developed much
    faster than interpretations. This makes sense — we needed to make sure the algorithms
    were accurate before trying to explain them. There is little purpose in explaining
    the predictions of an inaccurate model. Now that model interpretation techniques
    have caught up with the algorithms, we can have both reasoning behind predictions
    and high predictive accuracy.</p><p>While we are on the point of explanation,
    we should mention that humans are terrible at explaining their decisions. We do
    give reasons for individual choices, but there is no way these encompass the full
    combination of environment, genetics, situation, emotions, neurotransmitters,
    etc. that actually influence decisions. When we ask someone why they were late
    to work and they tell us “because I took a different subway route”, we accept
    that and usually stop the questioning there. We fail to dig into the reasoning
    or ask detailed follow-ups, which would lead to more follow-ups. We would need
    to know someone’s entire life history to explain fully even one choice they made,
    so clearly we don’t get complete explanations from humans.</p><p>I’ve found that
    people want any explanation, no matter how flimsy, rather than no explanation.
    Even if it’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(language)">tautology</a>
    (boys will be boys) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning">circular
    reasoning</a> (I made many spelling mistakes because my spelling is poor) people
    will accept any sort of justification. In contrast to human reasons, the SHAP
    values output by a machine learning model are more comprehensive, showing the
    exact weight assigned to each variable associated with a single prediction. At
    this point, I would prefer the numbers from these model explanation techniques
    than the misleading justifications given by humans.</p><p>Instead of worrying
    about model explainability, perhaps we should be dealing with the much more difficult
    problem of figuring out human decision making! We have made more progress in interpreting
    machine learning output than in figuring out the complex web of influences behind
    an individual’s particular actions. (I’m being a little light-hearted. I think
    <a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/">model interpretation</a>
    is one of the most promising areas in machine learning and am excited about new
    tools for explaining machine learning to non-technical audiences. My main point
    is we’ve come a long way towards explaining models since the paper.)</p><p><strong>3.
    With algorithmic models, more features can benefit performance</strong></p><p>In
    graduate data science modeling classes, my professors spent a large amount of
    time on feature selection using techniques like the <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/variance-inflation-factor/">variance
    inflation factor</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information">mutual
    information</a>. In the lab, I saw plenty of feature selection, almost always
    guided by intuition rather than standardized procedures. The reason might have
    been sound: linear models tend to not deal with many features well because they
    don’t have enough capacity to model all the information from the features — but
    the methods used were often subjective resulting in models more human-driven than
    data-driven.</p><p>By comparison, algorithmic models can gain from more features.
    Breiman points out that more variables mean more information and an effective
    model should be able to pick out the signal from the noise. ML methods like the
    random forest can provide accurate predictions with many features, even when the
    number of variables exceeds the number of data points, as often occurs in genomic
    datasets. Rather than expending time trying to intuit the important features to
    leave in, we can give algorithmic models all the features and let it figure out
    the ones most relevant to the task. Furthermore, we might actually want to create
    <em>additional features</em>, engineering them from the existing variables, to
    help the model extract even more information.</p><p>Intuition has no place in
    algoritmic modeling culture unlike in data models where it might inform the features
    that go into the model. If we really want to learn from the data, then we have
    to trust in the data instead of our subjective opinions. Algorithmic modeling
    does not require us to perform any arbitrary feature selection: instead, we leave
    in all the features, or even add more, and get better performance with less effort.</p><h3>4.
    Science Proceeds from Simple to Complex</h3><p>The final main point actually comes
    in Breiman’s response to criticism (see below), but it’s a crucial one. As our
    knowledge of the world advances, we need ever more complicated models for prediction
    and learning information.</p><p>Early models of the universe placed Earth at the
    center then shifted to the Sun at the center before settling on our current view,
    where the Milky Way is only one of billions of galaxies in an enormous (possibly
    infinite) universe. <a href="http://www.thestargarden.co.uk/Heliocentric-models-of-the-Solar-System.html">At
    each step, the model became more complicated</a> as we collected more information
    that did not fit existing models. Newton’s Laws of Gravitation worked pretty well
    for hundreds of years until further observations revealed their limitations. Now,
    we need Einstein’s Theories of Relativity (both special and general) to ensure
    that our satellites don’t fall out of the sky and so our GPS system remains accurate.</p><p>As
    other fields have developed more complex models to deal with new difficulties
    (the<a href="https://www.compoundchem.com/2016/10/13/atomicmodels/"> model of
    the atom</a> is another example), statistics should abandon old, linear models
    when they have outlived their usefulness. Data models worked well for a small
    subset of problems, but the challenges we face in data science are now much larger.
    The techniques used to solve them should correspondingly expand. If the rest of
    science is moving towards greater <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity">complexity</a>,
    why should we assume statistics can continue to operate with the simplest of models?
    There are a lot of exciting problems developing and solving them requires using
    whatever tool is most appropriate, or even inventing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">new
    techniques</a> for novel obstacles.</p><h2>Criticisms</h2><p>In the best scientific
    tradition, Breiman includes a substantial amount of criticism from 4 statisticians
    as an addendum to the paper and then responds to the feedback. It’s worth reading
    through the criticism and observing the back and forth (civil) arguments. Science
    advances through open discussion because no single person has all the right answers.
    It’s through an iterative process of proposing an idea, subjecting it to criticism,
    improving the idea in response, gathering more data, and opening the floor to
    more discussion that science has <a href="https://www.isbglasgow.com/10-greatest-scientific-discoveries-and-inventions-of-21st-century/">achieved
    great success</a>. Following is some of the pushback.</p><h3>1. Simple models
    are still useful</h3><p>This is a point Breiman willingly concedes: in some situations,
    a linear model might be appropriate. For example, if we were modeling distance
    as a function of rate, then this is a linear relationship: distance = rate * time.
    However, few phenomena in nature follow such a nice mechanism (even the example
    above almost never holds in the real world.) Linear models can work in the case
    of very small datasets with very few features, but quickly become obsolete when
    working on newer problems in areas such as astronomy, climate change, stock market
    forecasting, natural language processing, etc. where the datasets are large and
    contain thousands or more variables.</p><p>The algorithmic culture is not about
    abandoning data models, it’s using the most appropriate model in any situation.
    If a linear model records the highest predictive accuracy on a dataset, then it’s
    selected. Breiman’s point is more along the lines that we should not assume ahead
    of time which is the correct model. Algorithmic modeling is an all-the-above approach
    to modeling.</p><h3>2. Overfitting to the validation data</h3><p>Overfitting is
    a fundamental issue in machine learning: parameters are always learned on some
    dataset, which is not indicative of all data for the problem. By choosing a model
    with the best validation score, we might be inadvertently choosing a model that
    generalizes poorly to future data. This is not a problem unique to algorithmic
    models (although it may be easier to overfit with a more complex model since it
    has more free parameters to train).</p><p>The solution is not to go backwards
    to simpler models, but to use more robust validation. I prefer cross-validation,
    using multiple training/testing subsets so the performance is not biased by one
    random selection. The model may still be overfitting (this should be called the
    Kaggle effect because it occurs with literally every competition) but a robust
    validation setup should give a decent indication of performance on new data. It’s
    also critical to monitor the ongoing performance of the model in production. Periodically
    checking that the model accuracy has not degraded will allow you to catch model
    or data drift. Once this occurs, you need to build a new model, gather additional
    data, or start over on the problem. Overfitting is a serious problem, but it can
    be tackled with the right approach.</p><h3>3. Feature Importance</h3><p>Much of
    Breiman’s arguments about extracting information from a complex model relies on
    the idea of feature importance. This is not defined in the actual paper, but it
    is addressed in Breiman’s response to the criticism. His definition rests on accuracy.
    <em>The importance of a feature is measured by the question: does including the
    feature in the model improve performance?</em></p><p>Traditionally, variable importance
    was determined from the coefficients of a linear model. However, we’ve already
    seen that multiple features can yield the same performance, so using the learned
    weights as a measure of importance does not capture any single ground truth.</p><p>The
    area of variable importance is still not solved. There are problems when variables
    are collinear (highly correlated) because the feature importance might be split
    between the features. There is not yet a satisfactory method to determine which
    variables are the most important, but an accuracy-based approach is less subjective
    than a weights-based approach. SHAP values also provide a per-prediction measure
    of variable importance, letting us see the exact impact of each feature value
    from an observation on the output. Predictive feature importance may not be the
    “true” relevance of a feature in nature, but it can give us relative comparisons
    between variables.</p><h3>4. Goal of Modeling</h3><p>Some of the statisticians
    take aim at the idea that the goal of modeling is prediction, arguing for placing
    greater emphasis on information gathering. My response is a model that has no
    predictive accuracy cannot provide any useful information about the problem. It
    might provide model weights, but if they don’t lead to accurate predictions, why
    would we try to learn anything from them? Instead, we should focus on accuracy
    first — so we know our model has learned something useful — then try to figure
    out how the model operates. A model must be accurate to give us useful information!</p><p>There
    is little point in trying to understand a linear model that cannot outperform
    a simple no-machine learning baseline. Aim for accuracy, then spend as much time
    as your domain requires on interpreting the model. It is much better to have an
    accurate model with no explanation than a model that produces nonsense but presents
    a clear explanation.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>This paper would have been useful
    for me moving from an academic data science environment to industry. Initially,
    I spent a lot of time trying to understand the theory behind models or solve problems
    through intuition rather than aiming for accuracy and letting the data decide
    the model. Eventually, I learned the most important point of this paper through
    experience: focus on accuracy first and then explanation. A model must have high
    predictive performance before it’s worth using for knowledge extraction.</p><p>What
    this means in practice (particularly for those in industry) is simple: concentrate
    on setting up a robust validation scheme and find the model that performs the
    best. Don’t spend too much time worrying about the theory behind the model until
    you know it works. Furthermore, experience has shown that many models can produce
    the same accuracy with different sets of features, additional features can improve
    the performance of complex algorithms, and there is a balance between model interpretability
    and accuracy, although new techniques have largely closed the gap.</p><p>We all
    want explanations when we see a prediction or decision. However, we must admit
    when our knowledge and brains limit us: we simply cannot process the amount of
    data now facing us and we have to rely on machines to do most of the reasoning
    for us. Machine learning is a tool used to solve problems with data and we should
    use the best tools possible. Statistics is an old field, but that does not mean
    it has to remain stuck in the past: by adopting the latest algorithms, statisticians,
    even those in academia, can solve challenging new problems arising in modeling.</p><p>As

  :title: UX Design Across Different Cultures — Part 2
  :content: "<p>Firefox USA v.s. Firefox China</p><p>In <a href=\"https://blog.prototypr.io/ux-design-across-different-cultures-part-1-1caa12a504c0\">UX
    Design Across Cultures — Part 1</a>, I discussed why businesses should address
    cultural differences when expanding into a new market, how culture affects UX,
    and how to design for international users. In this article, I will share some
    more tips and tricks to design for international users, and how companies can
    be in a better position to take on culture-sensitive projects.</p><h2>Research
    mobile device usage in emerging markets</h2><p>Often, we as designers can fall
    into the trap of designing for ourselves. For example, when we search for ‘mobile
    design’ on Dribbble, most of the designs are mockups on high-end mobile phones,
    like these:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4160/1*_QfDPMRqJ6rGQONpjiCDDQ.png\"
    alt=\"High-fidelity iOS mockups. Source: [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com)\"><em>High-fidelity
    iOS mockups. Source: <a href=\"http://dribbble.com\">Dribbble</a></em></p><p>If
    you’re designing an app for high-paid techies based in San Francisco, it may be
    reasonable to assume that your users have iPhone 7 Pluses. However, when you’re
    designing for a new market, it’s important to research the devices users have.
    Keep in mind that not every user on the planet has the newest mobile phones.</p><h3><strong>Feature
    Phones</strong></h3><p>As the UX/UI Design Lead at Gimmie, loyalty CRM provider
    for digital publishers, I helped <a href=\"http://smart.com.ph/\">SMART</a> design
    a loyalty program for their Android users in the Philippines.</p><p>I assumed
    that Filipino users don’t have the most high-end phones and are mostly Android
    users. To verify this assumption, I worked with SMART’s engineers and PMs to uncover
    which phones users have.</p><p>We found out from data that <strong>41% of users</strong>
    use either Samsung Galaxy Y GT-S5360 or Samsung Galaxy GT S5300, which were very
    similar in device size and screen size.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*s3k2mQB9dYY8G_dqz-7qDQ.jpeg\"
    alt=\"*Samsung Galaxy Y GT-S5360. Source: [Samsung UK](http://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-y-s5360/)*\"><strong>Samsung
    Galaxy Y GT-S5360. Source: <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-y-s5360/\">Samsung
    UK</a></strong></p><p>Other than these two Samsung phones, users were on low-end
    phones that don’t even run on Android. It was interesting to learn that the phone
    models that our users currently have are phones that I have seen or used in 2007.</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*s4QhFZBuMWdiirmLaUqMog.png\"
    alt=\"*Phones our users have*\"><strong>Phones our users have</strong></p><p>Some
    designers think that they don’t need to design for specific screen sizes because
    Android automatically adjusts each application’s user interface to the current
    device screen by default.</p><p>However, according to Android Best Practices,</p><blockquote><h1><em>You
    should make the effort to optimize your application for different screen sizes
    and densities. In doing so, you maximize the *</em>user experience** for all devices
    and your users believe that your application was actually designed for their devices
    — rather than simply stretched to fit the screen on their devices.*</h1></blockquote><p>Since
    41% of SMART users had Samsung Galaxy Y or another device with a similar screen
    size, Samsung Galaxy Y became our main “device persona” in this project. I was
    able to persuade my team to buy a Samsung Galaxy Y so I can test my designs. Funnily
    enough, it was actually hard to find a shop in Singapore that sold that particular
    phone. Many shops told me that it was discontinued!</p><p>My approach to designing
    for feature phone screens includes testing text legibility and tapping area sizes.
    Similar to the approach of responsive web design, when designing for various screen
    sizes, make sure that designs don’t end just above the fold. Elements peeking
    on the fold cue users to scroll/swipe.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*7Cnms-3vFom3IqwmFAAD5Q.png\"
    alt=\"Screen ratio: Samsung Galaxy Y v.s. Nexus 5\"><em>Screen ratio: Samsung
    Galaxy Y v.s. Nexus 5</em></p><p>I used <a href=\"https://bjango.com/mac/skalapreview/\">Skala
    Preview</a> to preview my designs on my mobile phone directly from Photoshop (now
    I use Sketch Mirror, which didn’t exist yet in 2013). There are two reasons that
    I didn’t use prototyping web apps for this task:</p><p>Firstly, viewing the designs
    on the device instead of in the browser helps me understand the user experience
    more accurately. I tested if the buttons are the right sizes, if the texts are
    legible on small screens, and if the user flow from screens to screens were smooth.</p><p>Secondly,
    prototyping software including Invision and Marvel do not support older mobile
    device models.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*FSpCdaRdF8SF8d2Ja6ijag.jpeg\"
    alt=\"*Testing designs on Samsung Galaxy Y*\"><strong>Testing designs on Samsung
    Galaxy Y</strong></p><p>If I jumped right into high-fidelity mockups without understanding
    what phones users have, I would have designed something that looks nice on Dribbble,
    but is totally unusable for the target audience.</p><p>When you’re designing for
    users in emerging markets, first take some time to understand the platforms and
    devices of users.</p><h2>Design in the longest translation first</h2><p>A good
    development cycle involves developers and QA testers checking and addressing text
    overflow issues. As designers, we should help our colleagues think of these scenarios
    in advance and own the experience of users of different locales.</p><p>To design
    a localized product, we should think about: Is the language shorter or longer?
    How much white space will there be once translated? How long are the names in
    the local language?</p><p>This app download banner was one of my first projects
    at TravelBird. I started designing with English and Dutch and I thought it looked
    pretty good. When I translated the English string to Finnish, which is one of
    the longest European languages, the text was almost touching the button.</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2192/1*8e34DR3CZlLG7A4bBPtveQ.png\"
    alt=\"TravelBird App Download Banner: English vs. Dutch vs. Finnish\"><em>TravelBird
    App Download Banner: English vs. Dutch vs. Finnish</em></p><p>Knowing that the
    real translation could be even longer than the Google translation, I had to address
    the possible text overflow issue. So I increased the height of the text field
    to three lines to fit the longest language.</p><p>The real copy given by the translator
    was even longer by 33% — 15 characters longer than the original string — and fitted
    perfectly in the text field of three lines. Had I not make this change before
    I hand over the designs, I would be leaving it up to the developer to decide how
    to address the overflow issue.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*jrBy3Q4u36Gc1q5OJUxVdA.png\"
    alt=\"Final designs for TravelBird App Download Banner\"><em>Final designs for
    TravelBird App Download Banner</em></p><p>When designing a product that’s translated
    into 17 different languages, don’t just design in English. Check what the interface
    looks like with the shortest and longest languages. This way, you avoid the non-English
    translations getting cut off or overlapped when shown to your users.</p><h2>Research
    Local UI patterns</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*s4RwGHIzFBxCKpzDmdHVHA.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>We all know the hamburger menu icon and the more button on mobile
    apps. Both open up navigation links and more options. It’s pretty common in apps,
    so these got to be used worldwide, right?</p><p>Not exactly. At least, not in
    China.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ZrTb-6l3yUgr85CDGxBSOA.png\"

    <a href=\"http://dangrover.com/blog/2014/12/01/chinese-mobile-app-ui-trends.html\">Chinese
    UI design patterns, Dan Grover</a></em></p><p>In China, a “Discover” button (usually
    with a compass icon) is used for not-quite-essential extras. Chinese users see
    apps as an ecosystem rather than a single functioning product. To Chinese users,
    the action of “discover” intrigue curiosity, which is more valuable than knowing
    “here is more stuff”.</p><h3><strong>Searching v.s. Browsing</strong></h3><p>Another
    East vs West example is the landing page. Compare these two versions of Mozilla
    Firefox’s landing pages, there is much more content on the Chinese homepage, while
    on the American page there is one clear CTA (call-to-action).</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*4j3DGFiqc4MCWUEyXk8bsw.png\"

    USA v.s. Firefox China</em></p><p>Bram Pitoyo, Design Strategist at Mozilla, researched
    the most used websites for both demographics. He found that the number 1 most
    used websites — Google and Baidu — are both search engines optimized for searching.
    For Google and Baidu, there is one clear user goal and CTA.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3784/1*NMoEQR2czn3ccbOq_B1yoA.jpeg\"

    by Bram Pitoyo</em></p><p>However, most other most visited websites in China,
    such as QQ, Sina and 163 adopt a <strong>portal design</strong>, optimized for
    <strong>browsing</strong>. These portal sites contain more information than a
    search field and button.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2680/1*zcQil0bNQqRP2fEg9n70Jg.jpeg\"
    alt=\"QQ, Taobao and 163\"><em>QQ, Taobao and 163</em></p><p>Pitoyo’s assumption
    of the different design for the Chinese Firefox website:</p><blockquote><h1><em>Typing
    Chinese takes a long time and finding the precise word isn’t easy. Search sucks,
    so optimize for browsing.</em></h1></blockquote><p>Whether you design a web or
    mobile interface, utilizing an UI pattern familiar to locals is more efficient
    than introducing a known pattern elsewhere and asking local users to adapt to
    that.</p><p>My advice is to research the local UI patterns when you localize your
    product, also, research the most used and popular websites and apps and study
    why they adopt specific patterns.. Otherwise, your local users may be confused
    because they may not be familiar with the UI patterns from the West.</p><p>Depending
    on what your product is, if you’re designing for Chinese users, you may want to
    test whether or not the portal design or a discovery feature will be well received
    by your users.</p><h2>Create Personas of Local Users</h2><p>Personas are useful
    when designing for users of different cultures because you can put the users’
    cultural characteristics in front of you in the design process.</p><p>As with
    the best practice with personas is to verify them. It is even more important to
    verify the personas of users of different cultures. The less you are familiar
    with the culture of the users, the riskier the assumptions (personas) are.</p><p>To
    design personas that reflect local users, research your users and verify the personas
    with the local team or a user researcher.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*3MjqQYsD61Ux1Tx1hzM3Cg.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2290/1*IA-8duhwN8NVj5KJjJETpg.png\"
    alt=\"Personas I’ve designed, which helped me visualize users and their needs\"><em>Personas
    I’ve designed, which helped me visualize users and their needs</em></p><p>When
    designing personas of different cultures, be aware of stereotypes. For example,
    adjectives such as lazy, smart, or violent are stereotypes and not cultural characteristics.
    Cultural characteristics are different from stereotypes, in that these are backed
    by research and complicated, rather than general and oversimplified.</p><h3><strong>Mock
    up real user faces</strong></h3><p>When designing mockups and personas, designers
    often turn to avatar generators or Google to find images to use in the designs.
    When we design for users of different cultures, we should aim to understand who
    our users are, including what they look like.</p><blockquote><p>Choosing the qualities
    of my placeholder text helps me make better decisions, and sets better expectations
    with my clients.</p></blockquote><p><em>— Matthew Ström, Creator of <a href=\"http://datumipsum.com/\">Datum
    Ipsum</a></em></p><p>If choosing the right placeholder text helps us to make better
    decisions, there are even more reasons to choose better images in our mockups.
    Our mockups are used in walkthroughs, App/Play Store, press kits, sales presentations,
    marketing websites and more. If designers can’t see the users of the product,
    how can our users, investors, and clients?</p><p>Currently the most well-known
    Sketch content generator plugins generate mostly white male avatars and logos.
    This is a pain for designers that design for non-white-male users.</p><p><img

    for Responsive Navigation</strong></h3><p>If you need to design a responsive site
    that supports languages of various lengths, but you don’t have the resources to
    create different designs for each locale, you can use <a href=\"https://github.com/aaronbarker/makefit\">MakeFit</a>
    — a plugin that resizes the text elements to fit within the confined widths. This
    tool is made by Aaron Barker, who used it to address responsive navigation for
    73+ languages for LDS.org.</p><p>It’s a quick solution, but not perfect. While
    using this plugin, the longest texts/languages will be shrunk, compromising on
    the legibility.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*0nWuDdRt_0-QQQd61O6HHw.jpeg\"

    Character Counter</strong></h3><p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://medium.com/dropbox-design/design-for-internationalization-24c12ea6b38f\">Dropbox
    Design</a>, Brian Bimschleger built a Localization Character Counter to estimate
    localized copy length.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3998/1*MYdVF9WiSP6U6I5bjBrmlg.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>This may be useful as a back-of-the-napkin calculation, however,
    its limitation is that it doesn’t take in account of the sizes of the characters
    and language nuances.</p><p>For example, comparing Italian and Japanese translations,
    there are 35 characters in Italian but only 16 characters in Japanese even though
    the two are about the same length on the screen. Also, there are 2 systems in
    the Japanese language with different translation lengths: kanji and kana.</p><p>Use
    these tools to design for multiple languages, but ultimately, you should work
    with a local copywriter to make sure your translations and copy are 100% on point.</p><p>From
    observing and working with various companies for the past 6 years, I’ve noticed
    differences in companies that succeed in designing for international users and
    the ones that don’t.</p><p>Here are my suggestions for companies to be in a better
    position to take on culture-sensitive projects.</p><h2>Hire a Diverse Team</h2><p>If
    you’re designing for a specific locale, it goes without saying that having someone
    in your team who knows about the local culture is highly valuable.</p><p>If you’re
    building a product for international users, a team of diverse backgrounds helps
    to think about the product from different perspectives and generate more creative
    ideas than a homogenous team can.</p><p>At Gimmie, our team is from the U.S.,
    Singapore, Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, and Indonesia. We use English to communicate
    across the core team, and each local team communicates in their local languages.</p><p>Our
    local team in the Philippines helped us acquire leads in the Philippines and connected
    us with local clients. My Thai colleague helped us with the process of exhibiting
    our product in Thailand.</p><p>Because of our international team, we had more
    opportunities to showcase and sell our product in the Southeast Asia region. As
    a result, we have a list of international clients, from publishers in Singapore,
    to telecommunication companies in the Philippines, to game companies in Indonesia.</p><h3><strong>ROI
    of Diversity</strong></h3><p>I’ve seen portfolios of companies that create products
    for international users. Yet their team is made up of people who look like each
    other, whose ideas are not much different from one another. Their ideas and work
    are fuelled by burgers, foosball, and beer, as written on the company’s About
    page. Their job postings are in the local language, which rules out people who
    are able to do the work but not skilled in the language.</p><p>If I were the client
    and I want to solve problems for South African users or Indonesian users, I wouldn’t
    hire these companies. How can I trust the company to have empathy for the users
    and solve the problems effectively, if the company is not even open to gain different
    views and voices?</p><p>Whether your product is for international users or not,
    it is dangerous to have a homogenous team and listen to people just like yourselves
    because a homogenous team often has a narrower view and similar perspectives than
    a diverse team.</p><p>The recent revelations at Uber surfaced the problems of
    Silicon Valley’s bro culture — an aggressive and unrestrained workplace culture
    that focuses on growth and revenue targets. Often in this bro culture workplace,
    views of women and underrepresented groups are suppressed or ignored.</p><p>According
    to <a href=\"http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/diversity-matters\">Catalyst</a>,
    research finds that diverse and inclusive workplaces lead to multiple benefits
    including <strong>higher customer satisfaction</strong>, <strong>higher social
    sensitivity,</strong> and <strong>increased innovation</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/studio-d/studio-d-end-of-year-report-2015-85949c4dd7e1\">Studio
    D</a>, a specialized international design and research agency hired a crew of
    13 nationalities, as it reflects the diverse locales in which they operate.</p><blockquote><p>“Having
    mixed backgrounds is a real asset when you work in a team: ideas bounce back differently,
    and you end up making interesting connections.”</p></blockquote><p><em>— Parmigiano
    &amp; Camembert, London-based creative and advertising agency with clients all
    over Europe</em></p><blockquote><p>“Over time, diverse teams surface more creative
    ideas, precisely <em>because</em> they force shifts in communication style &amp;
    structure.”</p></blockquote><p><em>— Sarah Mei, Founder of RailsBridge</em></p><p>As
    a diversity advocate, I plead startup founders and VCs to increase diversity among
    their teams and investment portfolios. <a href=\"http://projectinclude.org/\">Project
    Include</a> is a great place to start acquainting yourself with diversity recommendations
    and case studies.</p><h2>Travel &amp; Ethnographic Research</h2><p>My biggest
    asset when it comes to designing for users of different cultures is that I learned
    culture differences firsthand during my travels. So far, I have travelled to 45
    countries.</p><p>When I’ve been to where the users are, seen their lifestyle,
    learned how they use online products, met local users, it was much easier to put
    myself in the users’ shoes and be empathetic to users’ pain points. The more I
    travel, the more open-minded and curious I become about other cultures and their
    ways of life.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2724/1*ys9QpcQiNPD3K81l6Fl1VA.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>According to a study by <a href=\"http://www.momondo.ca/letsopenourworld/#dna-videos--purpose\">Momondo</a>,
    76% of interviewees say that travelling has made them look more <strong>positively</strong>
    on <strong>cultural</strong> <strong>differences</strong> and <strong>diversity.</strong></p><p>In
    my experience, learning about other cultures first-hand has served me well to
    be a more culturally diverse designer than before I started travelling.</p><p>In
    addition, travelling for ethnographic research also helps you design for users
    of different cultures. You can conduct contextual inquiries to observe how users
    are actually getting things done. Through ethnographic research, you can truly
    understand their goals, motivations, pain points, in the right context.</p><h2>Work
    with a Cross-cultural UX Expert</h2><p>Beyond what I’ve mentioned in the article,
    there’s much more to consider when expanding into new markets. When you work with
    a UX designer or agency who is experienced in this area, they know what to look
    for, where to find users and can cut down the project time by a lot.</p><p>When
    you work with a designer who is experienced in working abroad, you get all the
    benefits of what the designer knows about the local cultures, without having to
    do all the travel and research yourself.</p><p>In this article, I discussed my
    approach to mobile design for emerging markets, East v.s. West design patterns,
    tips and tools to design for multiple languages, and tips to become a more culturally
    diverse designer.</p><p>It was fun to write about my experience of living abroad

  :title: How Technology is Hijacking Your Mind — from a Former Insider
  :content: '<p>Estimated reading time: 15 minutes.</p><blockquote><p>“It’s easier
    to fool people than to convince them that they’ve been fooled.” — Unknown.</p></blockquote><p>I’m
    an expert on how technology hijacks our psychological vulnerabilities. That’s
    why I spent the last three years as a Design Ethicist at Google caring about how
    to design things in a way that defends a billion people’s minds from getting hijacked.</p><p>When
    using technology, we often focus <em>optimistically</em> on all the things it
    does for us. But I want to show you where it might do the opposite.</p><p><em>Where
    does technology exploit our minds’ weaknesses</em>?</p><p>I learned to think this
    way when I was a magician. Magicians start by looking for <em>blind spots, edges,
    vulnerabilities and</em> <em>limits</em> of people’s perception, so they can influence
    what people do without them even realizing it. Once you know how to push people’s
    buttons, you can play them like a piano.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2892/1*IG2MfhS05JjHryBHnXLXwA.png"
    alt="That’s me performing sleight of hand magic at my mother’s birthday party"><em>That’s
    me performing sleight of hand magic at my mother’s birthday party</em></p><p>And
    this is exactly what product designers do to your mind. They play your psychological
    vulnerabilities (consciously and unconsciously) against you in the race to grab
    your attention.</p><p>I want to show you how they do it.</p><h3>Hijack #1: If
    You Control the Menu, You Control the Choices</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*kW01thCZaWQyq0A08hSj5Q.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Western Culture is built around ideals of individual choice and
    freedom. Millions of us fiercely defend our right to make “free” choices, while
    we ignore how those choices are manipulated upstream by menus we didn’t choose
    in the first place.</p><p>This is exactly what magicians do. They give people
    the illusion of free choice while architecting the menu so that they win, no matter
    what you choose. I can’t emphasize enough how deep this insight is.</p><p>When
    people are given a menu of choices, they rarely ask:</p><ul><li><p>“what’s not
    on the menu?”</p></li><li><p>“why am I being given <em>these options</em> and
    not others?”</p></li><li><p>“do I know the menu provider’s goals?”</p></li><li><p>“is
    this menu <em>empowering</em> for my original need, or are the choices actually
    a distraction?” (e.g. an overwhelmingly array of toothpastes)</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*-h0aCLf8EH5OxCIdMXERgA.jpeg" alt="How
    *empowering is this menu* of choices for the need, “I ran out of toothpaste”?"><em>How
    *empowering is this menu</em> of choices for the need, “I ran out of toothpaste”?*</p><p>For
    example, imagine you’re out with friends on a Tuesday night and want to keep the
    conversation going. You open Yelp to find nearby recommendations and see a list
    of bars. The group turns into a huddle of faces staring down at their phones *comparing
    bars. *They scrutinize the photos of each, comparing cocktail drinks. Is this
    menu still relevant to the original desire of the group?</p><p>It’s not that bars
    aren’t a good choice, it’s that Yelp substituted the group’s original question
    (“where can we go to keep talking?”) with a different question (“what’s a bar
    with good photos of cocktails?”) all by shaping the menu.</p><p>Moreover, the
    group falls for the illusion that Yelp’s menu represents a <em>complete set of
    choices</em> for where to go. While looking down at their phones, they don’t see
    the park across the street with a band playing live music. They miss the pop-up
    gallery on the other side of the street serving crepes and coffee. Neither of
    those show up on Yelp’s menu.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2218/1*Ih_bIVQ12Ibu076252-bKA.png"
    alt="Yelp subtly reframes the group’s need “where can we go to keep talking?”
    in terms of photos of cocktails served."><em>Yelp subtly reframes the group’s
    need “where can we go to keep talking?” in terms of photos of cocktails served.</em></p><p>The
    more choices technology gives us in nearly every domain of our lives (information,
    events, places to go, friends, dating, jobs) — <em>the more we assume that our
    phone is always the most empowering and useful menu to pick from</em>. Is it?</p><p><em>**The
    “most empowering” menu is different than the menu that has the most choices</em>*.
    *But when we blindly surrender to the menus we’re given, it’s easy to lose track
    of the difference:</p><ul><li><p>“Who’s free tonight to hang out?” becomes a menu
    of *most recent people who texted us *(who we could ping).</p></li><li><p>“What’s
    happening in the world?” becomes a menu of news feed stories.</p></li><li><p>“Who’s
    single to go on a date?” becomes a menu* *of faces to swipe on Tinder (instead
    of local events with friends, or urban adventures nearby).</p></li><li><p>“I have
    to respond to this email.” becomes a menu of <em>keys to type a response</em>
    (instead of empowering ways to communicate with a person).</p></li></ul><p><img

    from, technology hijacks the way we perceive our choices and replaces them with
    new ones. But the closer we pay attention to the options we’re given, the more
    we’ll notice when they don’t actually align with our true needs.</p><h3><strong>Hijack
    #2: Put a Slot Machine In a Billion Pockets</strong></h3><p>If you’re an app,
    how do you keep people hooked? Turn yourself into a slot machine.</p><p>The average
    person checks their phone 150 times a day. Why do we do this? Are we making <em>150</em>
    <em>conscious</em> <em>choices</em>?</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*BNOfmUQ2nTRVPVe0CHx7ew.png"
    alt="How often do you check your email per day?"><em>How often do you check your
    email per day?</em></p><p>One major reason why is the #1 psychological ingredient
    in slot machines: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Intermittent_reinforcement.3B_schedules">**intermittent
    variable rewards</a>**.</p><p>If you want to maximize addictiveness, all tech
    designers need to do is link a user’s action (like pulling a lever) with a <em>variable
    reward</em>. You pull a lever and immediately receive either an enticing reward
    (a match, a prize!) or nothing. Addictiveness is maximized when the rate of reward
    is most variable.</p><p>Does this effect really work on people? Yes. <strong>Slot
    machines make more money in the United States than baseball, movies, and theme
    parks <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/slot-machines-the-big-gamble-07-01-2011/">combined</a>*.</strong>*
    Relative to other kinds of gambling, people get ‘problematically involved’ with
    slot machines <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/episode-78-no-armed-bandit/">**3–4x
    faster</a>*** <em>according to NYU professor Natasha Dow Schull, author of *Addiction
    by Design.</em></p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5184/1*jv-w56ymDBTwsiqx7YdIdQ.jpeg"
    alt="Image courtesy of Jopwell"><em>Image courtesy of Jopwell</em></p><p><strong>But
    here’s the unfortunate truth — several billion people have a slot machine their
    pocket:</strong></p><ul><li><p>When we pull our phone out of our pocket, we’re
    <em>playing a slot machine</em> to see what notifications we got.</p></li><li><p>When
    we pull to refresh our email, we’re *playing a slot machine *to see what new email
    we got.</p></li><li><p>When we swipe down our finger to scroll the Instagram feed,
    we’re <em>playing a slot machine</em> to see what photo comes next.</p></li><li><p>When
    we swipe faces left/right on dating apps like Tinder, we’re <em>playing a slot
    machine</em> to see if we got a match.</p></li><li><p>When we tap the # of red
    notifications, we’re *playing a slot machine *to what’s underneath.</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*IoBUUcjfeAUnmY2ccu75Ww.png" alt=""></p><p>Apps
    and websites sprinkle intermittent variable rewards all over their products because
    it’s good for business.</p><p>But in other cases, slot machines emerge by accident.
    For example, there is no malicious corporation behind <em>all of email</em> who
    consciously chose to make it a slot machine. No one profits when millions check
    their email and nothing’s there. Neither did Apple and Google’s designers <em>want</em>
    phones to work like slot machines. It emerged by accident.</p><p>But now companies
    like Apple and Google have a responsibility to reduce these effects by <em>converting
    intermittent variable rewards into less addictive, more predictable ones</em>
    with better design. For example, they could empower people to set predictable
    times during the day or week for when they want to check “slot machine” apps,
    and correspondingly adjust when new messages are delivered to align with those
    times.</p><h3>Hijack #3: Fear of Missing Something Important (FOMSI)</h3><p>Another
    way apps and websites hijack people’s minds is by inducing a “1% chance you could
    be missing something important.”</p><p>If I convince you that I’m a channel for
    important information, messages, friendships, or potential sexual opportunities
    — it will be hard for you to turn me off, unsubscribe, or remove your account
    — because (aha, I win) you might miss something important:</p><ul><li><p>This
    keeps us subscribed to newsletters even after they haven’t delivered recent benefits
    (“what if I miss a future announcement?”)</p></li><li><p>This keeps us “friended”
    to people with whom we haven’t spoke in ages (“what if I miss something important
    from them?”)</p></li><li><p>This keeps us swiping faces on dating apps, even when
    we haven’t even met up with anyone in a while (“what if I miss that <em>one hot
    match</em> who likes me?”)</p></li><li><p>This keeps us using social media (“what
    if I miss that important news story or fall behind what my friends are talking
    about?”)</p></li></ul><p>But if we zoom into that fear, we’ll discover that it’s
    unbounded*: we’ll always miss something important *at any point when we stop using
    something.</p><ul><li><p>There are magic moments on Facebook we’ll miss by not
    using it for the 6th hour (e.g. an old friend who’s visiting town <em>right now</em>).</p></li><li><p>There
    are magic moments we’ll miss on Tinder (e.g. our dream romantic partner) by not
    swiping our 700th match.</p></li><li><p>There are emergency phone calls we’ll
    miss if we’re not connected 24/7<em>.</em></p></li></ul><p><em>But living moment
    to moment with the fear of missing something isn’t how we’re built to live.</em></p><p>And
    it’s amazing how quickly, once we let go of that fear, we wake up from the illusion.
    When we unplug for more than a day, unsubscribe from those notifications, or go
    to <a href="http://campgrounded.org">Camp Grounded</a> — the concerns we thought
    we’d have don’t actually happen.</p><p><em>We don’t miss what we don’t see.</em></p><p>The
    thought, “what if I miss something important?” is generated *in advance of unplugging,
    unsubscribing, or turning off *— not after. Imagine if tech companies recognized
    that, and helped us proactively tune our relationships with friends and businesses
    in terms of what we define as “<a href="http://timewellspent.io">time well spent</a>”
    for our lives, instead of in terms of what we might miss.</p><h3>Hijack #4: Social
    Approval</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*qnyJGSiHouwhM_rhhvy_rA.png"
    alt="Easily one of the most persuasive things a human being can receive."><em>Easily
    one of the most persuasive things a human being can receive.</em></p><p>We’re
    all vulnerable to <strong>social approval</strong>. The need to belong, to be
    approved or appreciated by our peers is among the highest human motivations. But
    now our social approval is in the hands of tech companies.</p><p>When I get tagged
    by my friend Marc, I imagine him making a *conscious choice *to tag me. But I
    don’t see how a company like Facebook orchestrated his doing that in the first
    place.</p><p>Facebook, Instagram or SnapChat can manipulate how often people get
    tagged in photos by automatically suggesting all the faces people should tag (e.g.
    by showing a box with a 1-click confirmation, “Tag Tristan in this photo?”).</p><p>So
    when Marc tags me, <em>he’s actually</em> <em>responding to Facebook’s suggestion,</em>
    not making an independent choice. But through design choices like this, <em>Facebook
    controls the multiplier for</em> <em>how often millions of people experience their
    social approval on the line</em>.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*YkxjEeZ_CO0a2Gp9Awf_bQ.png"

    suggestions like this to get people to tag more people, creating more social externalities
    and interruptions.</em></p><p>The same happens when we change our main profile
    photo — Facebook knows that’s a moment when we’re <em>vulnerable to social approval</em>:
    *“what do my friends think of my new pic?” *Facebook can rank this higher in the
    news feed, so it sticks around for longer and more friends will like or comment
    on it. Each time they like or comment on it, we’ll get pulled right back.</p><p>Everyone
    innately responds to social approval, but some demographics (teenagers) are more
    vulnerable to it than others. That’s why it’s so important to recognize how powerful
    designers are when they exploit this vulnerability.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*7Gt5k-6sigW8e1QoLARuYg.png"
    alt=""></p><h3>Hijack #5: Social Reciprocity (Tit-for-tat)</h3><ul><li><p>You
    do me a favor — I owe you one next time.</p></li><li><p>You say, “thank you”—
    I have to say “you’re welcome.”</p></li><li><p>You send me an email— it’s rude
    not to get back to you.</p></li><li><p>You follow me — it’s rude not to follow
    you back. (especially for teenagers)</p></li></ul><p>We are <em>vulnerable</em>
    <em>to needing to reciprocate others’ gestures</em>. But as with Social Approval,
    tech companies now manipulate how often we experience it.</p><p>In some cases,
    it’s by accident.* Email, texting and messaging apps are social reciprocity factories*.
    But in other cases, companies exploit this vulnerability on purpose.</p><p>LinkedIn
    is the most obvious offender. LinkedIn wants as many people creating social obligations
    for each other as possible, because each time they reciprocate (by accepting a
    connection, responding to a message, or endorsing someone back for a skill) they
    have to come back to linkedin.com where they can get people to spend more time.</p><p>Like
    Facebook, LinkedIn exploits an asymmetry in perception. When you receive an invitation
    from someone to connect, you imagine that person making a <em>conscious choice</em>
    to invite you, when in reality, they likely unconsciously responded to LinkedIn’s
    list of suggested contacts. In other words, LinkedIn turns your* unconscious impulses*
    (to “add” a person) into new social obligations that millions of people feel obligated
    to repay. All while they profit from the time people spend doing it.</p><p><img

    millions of people getting interrupted like this throughout their day, running
    around like chickens with their heads cut off, reciprocating each other — all
    designed by companies who profit from it.</p><p>Welcome to social media.</p><p><img

    accepting an endorsement, LinkedIn takes advantage of your bias to reciprocate
    by offering *four</em> additional people for you to endorse in return.*</p><p>Imagine
    if technology companies had a responsibility to minimize social reciprocity. Or
    if there was an independent organization that represented the public’s interests
    — an industry consortium or an FDA for tech — that monitored when technology companies
    abused these biases?</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2068/1*5wyghDrGzpUYxGZkZRzE_A.png"
    alt=""></p><h3><strong>Hijack #6: Bottomless bowls, Infinite Feeds, and Autoplay</strong></h3><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*d_4O5k_1k9LLadu3HMmtXg.png" alt="YouTube
    autoplays the next video after a countdown"><em>YouTube autoplays the next video
    after a countdown</em></p><p>Another way to hijack people is to keep them consuming
    things, even when they aren’t hungry anymore.</p><p>How? Easy. <em>Take an experience
    that was bounded and finite, and turn it into a bottomless flow</em> <em>that
    keeps going</em>.</p><p>Cornell professor Brian Wansink demonstrated this in his
    study showing <a href="http://foodpsychology.cornell.edu/discoveries/bottomless-bowls">you
    can trick people into keep eating soup by giving them a bottomless bowl</a> that
    automatically refills as they eat. With bottomless bowls, people eat 73% more
    calories than those with normal bowls and underestimate how many calories they
    ate by 140 calories.</p><p>Tech companies exploit the same principle. News feeds
    are purposely designed to auto-refill with reasons to keep you scrolling, and
    purposely eliminate any reason for you to pause, reconsider or leave.</p><p>It’s
    also why video and social media sites like Netflix, YouTube or Facebook <em>autoplay</em>
    the next video after a countdown instead of waiting for you to make a conscious
    choice (in case you won’t). A huge portion of traffic on these websites is driven
    by autoplaying the next thing.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3064/1*y2lmMCXN6papGONxwGDazA.png"

    alt="Facebook autoplays the next video after a countdown"><em>Facebook autoplays
    the next video after a countdown</em></p><p>Tech companies often claim that “we’re
    just making it easier for users to see the video <em>they want</em> to watch”
    when they are actually serving their business interests. And you can’t blame them,
    because increasing “time spent” is the currency they compete for.</p><p>Instead,
    imagine if technology companies empowered you to <em>consciously bound your experience
    *to align with what would be “<a href="http://timewellspent.io">time well spent</a>”
    for you. Not just bounding the *quantity *of time you spend, but the *qualities</em>
    of what would be “time well spent.”</p><h3>Hijack #7: Instant Interruption vs.
    “Respectful” Delivery</h3><p>Companies know that messages *that interrupt people
    immediately are more persuasive at getting people to respond *than messages delivered
    asynchronously (like email or any deferred inbox).</p><p>Given the choice, Facebook
    Messenger (or WhatsApp, WeChat or SnapChat for that matter) would <em>prefer to
    design their messaging system to</em> *interrupt recipients immediately (and show
    a chat box) *instead of helping users respect each other’s attention.</p><p>In
    other words, <strong>interruption is good for business</strong>.</p><p>It’s also
    in their interest to heighten the feeling of urgency and social reciprocity. For
    example, Facebook automatically <em>tells the sender when you “saw” their message,
    instead of letting you avoid disclosing whether you read it</em> (“now that you
    know I’ve seen the message, I feel even more obligated to respond.”)</p><p>By
    contrast, Apple more respectfully lets users toggle “Read Receipts” on or off.</p><p>The
    problem is, maximizing interruptions in the name of business creates a tragedy
    of the commons, ruining global attention spans and causing billions of unnecessary
    interruptions each day. This is a huge problem we need to fix with shared design
    standards (potentially, as part of <a href="http://timewellspent.io">Time Well
    Spent</a>).</p><h3>Hijack #8: Bundling Your Reasons with Their Reasons</h3><p>Another
    way apps hijack you is by taking <em>your reasons</em> for visiting the app (to
    perform a task) and <em>make them inseparable from the app’s business reasons</em>
    (maximizing how much we consume once we’re there).</p><p>For example, in the physical
    world of grocery stores, the #1 and #2 most popular reasons to visit are pharmacy
    refills and buying milk. But grocery stores want to maximize how much people buy,
    so they put the pharmacy and the milk at the back of the store.</p><p><em>In other
    words, they make the thing customers want (milk, pharmacy) inseparable from what
    the business wants.</em> If stores were <em>truly organized to support people</em>,
    they would <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/12792420">put the most popular
    items in the front</a>.</p><p>Tech companies design their websites the same way.
    For example, when you you want to look up a Facebook event happening tonight (your
    reason) the Facebook app doesn’t allow you to access it without first landing
    on the news feed (their reasons), and that’s on purpose. <em>Facebook wants to
    convert every reason you have for using Facebook, into their reason which is to
    maximize the time you spend consuming things</em>.</p><p>Instead, imagine if …</p><ul><li><p>Twitter
    gave you a <em>separate way</em> to post a tweet than having to see their news
    feed.</p></li><li><p>Facebook gave a <em>separate way</em> to look up Facebook
    Events going on tonight, without being forced to use their news feed.</p></li><li><p>Facebook
    gave you a <em>separate way</em> to use Facebook Connect as a passport for creating
    new accounts on 3rd party apps and websites, without being forced to install Facebook’s
    entire app, news feed and notifications.</p></li></ul><p>In a <a href="http://timewellspent.io">Time
    Well Spent world</a>, there is always a <em>direct way</em> to get what you want
    <em>separately</em> from what businesses want. Imagine a digital “bill of rights”
    outlining design standards that forced the products used by billions of people
    to let them navigate directly to what they want without needing to go through
    intentionally placed distractions.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*HkSOLmgs_RAiKbRMJt9HxA.png"
    alt="Imagine if web browsers empowered you to navigate directly to what you want
    — especially for sites that intentionally detour you toward their reasons."><em>Imagine
    if web browsers empowered you to navigate directly to what you want — especially
    for sites that intentionally detour you toward their reasons.</em></p><h3><strong>Hijack
    #9: Inconvenient Choices</strong></h3><p>We’re told that it’s enough for businesses
    to “make choices available.”</p><ul><li><p>“If you don’t like it you can always
    use a different product.”</p></li><li><p>“If you don’t like it, you can always
    unsubscribe.”</p></li><li><p>“If you’re addicted to our app, you can always uninstall
    it from your phone.”</p></li></ul><p>Businesses naturally <em>want to make the
    choices they want you to make easier, and the choices they don’t want you to make
    harder.</em> Magicians do the same thing. You make it easier for a spectator to
    pick the thing you want them to pick, and harder to pick the thing you don’t.</p><p>For
    example, NYTimes.com lets you “make a free choice” to cancel your digital subscription.
    But instead of just doing it when you hit “Cancel Subscription,” they <em>send
    you an email with information on how to cancel your account by calling a phone
    number</em> that’s only open at certain times.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*kSGi-JcMMGgwigs6VgFY2A.png"
    alt="NYTimes claims it’s giving a free choice to cancel your account"><em>NYTimes
    claims it’s giving a free choice to cancel your account</em></p><p>Instead of
    viewing the world in terms of <em>availability of choices</em>, we should view
    the world in terms of <em>friction required to enact choices</em>. Imagine a world
    where choices were labeled with how difficult they were to fulfill (like coefficients
    of friction) and there was an independent entity — an industry consortium or non-profit
    — that labeled these difficulties and set standards for how easy navigation should
    be.</p><h3>Hijack #10: Forecasting Errors, “Foot in the Door” strategies</h3><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vQ7yG7niPETreL7zjBuFkA.png" alt="Facebook
    promises an easy choice to “See Photo.” Would we still click if it gave the true
    price tag?"><em>Facebook promises an easy choice to “See Photo.” Would we still
    click if it gave the true price tag?</em></p><p>Lastly, apps can exploit people’s
    inability to forecast the consequences of a click.</p><p>People don’t intuitively
    forecast the <em>true cost</em> *of a click *when it’s presented to them. Sales
    people use “foot in the door” techniques by asking for a small innocuous request
    to begin with (“just one click to see which tweet got retweeted”) and escalate
    from there (“why don’t you stay awhile?”). Virtually all engagement websites use
    this trick.</p><p>Imagine if web browsers and smartphones, the gateways through
    which people make these choices, were truly watching out for people and helped
    them forecast the consequences of clicks (based on real data about <a href="https://github.com/jxe/hindsight">what
    benefits and costs it actually had</a>?).</p><p>That’s why I add “Estimated reading
    time” to the top of my posts. When you put the “true cost” of a choice in front
    of people, you’re treating your users or audience with dignity and respect. In
    a <a href="http://timewellspent.io">Time Well Spent</a> internet, choices could
    be framed in terms of projected cost and benefit, so people were empowered to
    make informed choices by default, not by doing extra work.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Xvo46OL3h2wDdb7S7AA1uQ.png"

    a single click review (“How many stars?”) while hiding the three page survey of
    questions behind the click.</em></p><h3>Summary And How We Can Fix This</h3><p>Are
    you upset that technology hijacks your agency? I am too. I’ve listed a few techniques
    but there are literally thousands. Imagine whole bookshelves, seminars, workshops
    and trainings that teach aspiring tech entrepreneurs techniques like these. Imagine
    hundreds of engineers whose job every day is to invent new ways to keep you hooked.</p><p>The
    ultimate freedom is a free mind, and we need technology that’s on our team to
    help us live, feel, think and act freely.</p><p>We need our smartphones, notifications
    screens and web browsers to be exoskeletons for our minds and interpersonal relationships
    that put our values, not our impulses, first. <a href="http://timewellspent.io">People’s
    time is valuable</a>. And we should protect it with the same rigor as privacy
    and other digital rights.</p><p><em>Tristan Harris was a Design Ethicist at Google

    start with this: Venmo is a free service to transfer dollars, and bitcoin transfers
    are not free. Yet after I wrote<a href="https://medium.com/@kaistinchcombe/ten-years-in-nobody-has-come-up-with-a-use-case-for-blockchain-ee98c180100">
    an article last December</a> saying bitcoin had no use, someone<a href="https://medium.com/@aaronjmendelsohn/there-is-so-much-wrong-with-this-i-couldnt-get-through-it-all-2dd24a109e0c">

    free way to transfer money from one person to another and discovered bitcoin.
    In fact, I would assert that there is <em>no single person in existence</em> who

    was the best way to solve it, and therefore became a blockchain enthusiast.</p><blockquote><h1>There

    and Walmart have gone long on press but short on actual rollout. Even the most
    prominent blockchain company, Ripple, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-25/ripple-wants-xrp-to-be-bitcoin-for-banks-if-only-the-banks-wanted-it">doesn’t
    use blockchain in its product</a>. You read that right: the company <em>Ripple</em>
    decided the best way to move money across international borders was to <em>not
    use Ripples</em>.</p><h3>A blockchain is a literal technology, not a metaphor</h3><p>Why
    all the enthusiasm for something so useless in practice?</p><p>People have made
    a number of implausible claims about the future of blockchain—like that you <a
    href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/12/23/why-you-want-blockchain-based-ai-even-if-you-dont-know-it-yet/">should
    use it for AI</a> in place of the type of behavior-tracking that google and facebook
    do, for example. This is based on a misunderstanding of what a blockchain is.
    A blockchain isn’t an ethereal thing out there in the universe that you can “put”
    things into, it’s a specific data structure: a linear transaction log, typically
    replicated by computers whose owners (called miners) are rewarded for logging
    new transactions.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*O2IXj90Y2XxXdZRpwt8wkw.png"
    alt="In The Golden Compass, Dust permeates the world. It is created by consciousness
    and is itself conscious, and can condense into angels. Blockchain is not like
    that."><em>In The Golden Compass, Dust permeates the world. It is created by consciousness
    and is itself conscious, and can condense into angels. Blockchain is not like
    that.</em></p><p>There are two things that are cool about this particular data
    structure. One is that a change in any block invalidates every block after it,
    which means that you can’t tamper with historical transactions. The second is
    that you only get rewarded if you’re working on the same chain as everyone else,
    so each participant has an incentive to go with the consensus.</p><p>The end result
    is a shared definitive historical record. And, what’s more, because consensus
    is formed by each person acting in their own interest, adding a false transaction
    or working from a different history just means you’re not getting paid and everyone
    else is. Following the rules is mathematically enforced—no government or police
    force need come in and tell you the transaction you’ve logged is false (or extort
    bribes or bully the participants). It’s a powerful idea.</p><p>So in summary,
    here’s what blockchain-the-technology is: <em>“Let’s create a very long sequence
    of small files — each one containing a hash of the previous file, some new data,
    and the answer to a difficult math problem — and divide up some money every hour
    among anyone willing to certify and store those files for us on their computers.”</em></p><p>Now,
    here’s what blockchain-the-metaphor is: <em>“What if everyone keeps their records
    in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone?”</em></p><p>An illustration
    of the difference: In 2006, Walmart launched a system to track its bananas and
    mangoes from field to store. In 2009 they abandoned it because of logistical problems
    getting everyone to enter the data, and in 2017 they re-launched it (to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22six%20days,%2018%20hours,%20and%2026%20minutes%22">much
    fanfare</a>) on blockchain. If someone comes to you with “the mango-pickers don’t
    like doing data entry,” “I know: let’s create a very long sequence of small files,
    each one containing a hash of the previous file” is a nonsense answer, but “What
    if everyone keeps their records in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone?”
    at least addresses the right question!</p><h3>Blockchain-based trustworthiness
    falls apart in practice</h3><p>People treat blockchain as a “futuristic integrity
    wand”—wave a blockchain at the problem, and suddenly your data will be valid.
    For almost anything people want to be <em>valid</em>, blockchain has been proposed
    as a solution.</p><p>It’s true that tampering with data stored on a blockchain
    is hard, but it’s false that blockchain is a good way to create data that has
    integrity.</p><blockquote><h1>It’s true that tampering with data stored on a blockchain
    is hard, but it’s false that blockchain is a good way to create data that has
    integrity.</h1></blockquote><p>To understand why this is the case, let’s work
    from the practical to the theoretical. For example, let’s consider a widely-proposed
    use case for blockchain: buying an e-book with a “smart” contract. The goal of
    the blockchain is, you don’t trust an e-book vendor and they don’t trust you (because
    you’re just two individuals on the internet), but, because it’s on blockchain,
    you’ll be able to trust the transaction.</p><p>In the traditional system, once
    you pay you’re <em>hoping</em> you’ll receive the book, but once the vendor has
    your money they don’t have any incentive to deliver. You’re relying on Visa or
    Amazon or the government to make things fair—what a recipe for being a chump!
    In contrast, on a blockchain system, by executing the transaction as a record
    in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone, the transfer of money and digital
    product is automatic, atomic, and direct, with no middleman needed to arbitrate
    the transaction, dictate terms, and take a fat cut on the way. Isn’t that better
    for everybody?</p><p>Hm. Perhaps you are very skilled at writing software. When
    the novelist proposes the smart contract, you take an hour or two to make sure
    that the contract will withdraw only an amount of money equal to the agreed-upon

    entire worldview underlying blockchain is wrong</h3><p>You actually see it over
    and over again. Blockchain systems are supposed to be <em>more</em> trustworthy,
    but in fact they are <em>the least trustworthy systems in the world</em>. Today,

    does blockchain stop this guy from spraying pesticides?</em></p><p>Blockchain
    systems do not magically make the data in them accurate or the people entering
    the data trustworthy, they merely enable you to audit whether it has been tampered
    with. A person who sprayed pesticides on a mango can still enter onto a blockchain
    system that the mangoes were organic. A corrupt government can create a blockchain
    system to count the votes and just allocate an extra million addresses to their
    cronies. An investment fund whose charter is written in software can still misallocate
    funds.</p><p>How then, is trust created?</p><p>In the case of buying an e-book,
    <em>even if you’re buying it with a smart contract,</em> instead of auditing the
    software you’ll rely on one of four things, each of them characteristics of the
    “old way”: either the author of the smart contract is someone you know of and
    trust, the seller of the e-book has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation">reputation
    to uphold</a>, you or friends of yours have bought e-books from this seller in
    the past successfully, or you’re just willing to hope that this person will deal
    fairly. In each case, <em>even</em> if the transaction is effectuated via a smart
    contract, in practice you’re relying on trust of a counterparty or middleman,
    not your self-protective right to audit the software, each man an island unto
    himself. The contract still works, but the fact that the promise is written in
    auditable software rather than government-enforced English makes it <em>less</em>
    transparent, not <em>more</em> transparent.</p><p>The same for the vote counting.
    Before blockchain can even get involved, you need to trust that voter registration
    is done fairly, that ballots are given only to eligible voters, that the votes
    are made anonymously rather than bought or intimidated, that the vote displayed
    by the balloting system is the same as the vote recorded, and that no extra votes
    are given to the political cronies to cast. Blockchain makes none of these problems
    easier and many of them harder—but more importantly, solving them in a blockchain
    context requires a set of awkward workarounds that undermine the core premise.
    So we know the entries are valid, let’s allow only trusted nonprofits to make
    entries—and you’re back at the good old “classic” ledger. In fact, if you look
    at <em>any</em> blockchain solution, inevitably you’ll find an awkward workaround
    to re-create trusted parties in a trustless world.</p><h3>A crypto-medieval system</h3><p>Yet
    absent these “old way” factors—supposing you actually attempted to rely on blockchain’s
    self-interest/self-protection to build a real system—you’d be in a real mess.</p><p><img

    A lawless and mistrustful world where self-interest is the only principle and

    hellhole.</p><p>As a society, and as technologists and entrepreneurs in particular,
    we’re going to have to get good at cooperating — at building trust, and, at being
    trustworthy. Instead of directing resources to the <em>elimination</em> of trust,

  :title: Artwork Personalization at Netflix
  :content: '<p>By Ashok Chandrashekar, Fernando Amat, Justin Basilico and Tony Jebara</p><p>For
    many years, the main goal of the Netflix personalized recommendation system has
    been to get the right titles in front each of our members at the right time. With
    a catalog spanning thousands of titles and a diverse member base spanning over
    a hundred million accounts, recommending the titles that are just right for each
    member is crucial. But the job of recommendation does not end there. Why should
    you care about any particular title we recommend? What can we say about a new
    and unfamiliar title that will pique your interest? How do we convince you that
    a title is worth watching? Answering these questions is critical in helping our
    members discover great content, especially for unfamiliar titles. One avenue to
    address this challenge is to consider the artwork or imagery we use to portray
    the titles. If the artwork representing a title captures something compelling
    to you, then it acts as a gateway into that title and gives you some visual “evidence”
    for why the title might be good for you. The artwork may highlight an actor that
    you recognize, capture an exciting moment like a car chase, or contain a dramatic
    scene that conveys the essence of a movie or TV show. If we present that perfect
    image on your homepage (and as they say: an image is worth a thousand words),
    then maybe, just maybe, you will give it a try. This is yet another way Netflix
    differs from traditional media offerings: we don’t have one product but over a
    100 million different products with one for each of our members with <em>personalized
    recommendations</em> and <em>personalized visuals</em>.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*038O1qN_N7lC3CGD."
    alt="A Netflix homepage without artwork. This is how historically our recommendation
    algorithms viewed a page."><em>A Netflix homepage without artwork. This is how
    historically our recommendation algorithms viewed a page.</em></p><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/selecting-the-best-artwork-for-videos-through-a-b-testing-f6155c4595f6">previous</a>
    <a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/the-power-of-a-picture">work</a>,
    we discussed an effort to find the single perfect artwork for each title across
    <em>all</em> our members. Through multi-armed bandit algorithms, we hunted for
    the best artwork for a title, say Stranger Things, that would earn the most plays
    from the largest fraction of our members. However, given the enormous diversity
    in taste and preferences, wouldn’t it be better if we could find the best artwork
    for <em>each</em> of our members to highlight the aspects of a title that are
    specifically relevant to <em>them</em>?</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2928/1*xwD8rVHPapbfmrl6AIbQbA.png"
    alt="Artwork for Stranger Things that each receive over 5% of impressions from
    our personalization algorithm. Different images cover a breadth of themes in the
    show to go beyond what any single image portrays."><em>Artwork for Stranger Things
    that each receive over 5% of impressions from our personalization algorithm. Different
    images cover a breadth of themes in the show to go beyond what any single image
    portrays.</em></p><p>As inspiration, let us explore scenarios where personalization
    of artwork would be meaningful. Consider the following examples where different
    members have different viewing histories. On the left are three titles a member
    watched in the past. To the right of the arrow is the artwork that a member would
    get for a particular movie that we recommend for them.</p><p>Let us consider trying
    to personalize the image we use to depict the movie Good Will Hunting. Here we
    might personalize this decision based on how much a member prefers different genres
    and themes. Someone who has watched many romantic movies may be interested in
    Good Will Hunting if we show the artwork containing Matt Damon and Minnie Driver,
    whereas, a member who has watched many comedies might be drawn to the movie if
    we use the artwork containing Robin Williams, a well-known comedian.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*yRGioOTb4-CZc6Fc." alt=""></p><p>In
    another scenario, let’s imagine how the different preferences for cast members
    might influence the personalization of the artwork for the movie Pulp Fiction.
    A member who watches many movies featuring Uma Thurman would likely respond positively
    to the artwork for Pulp Fiction that contains Uma. Meanwhile, a fan of John Travolta
    may be more interested in watching Pulp Fiction if the artwork features John.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*wRcWWaW0SDnT2xSI." alt=""></p><p>Of
    course, not all the scenarios for personalizing artwork are this clear and obvious.
    So we don’t enumerate such hand-derived rules but instead rely on the data to
    tell us what signals to use. Overall, by personalizing artwork we help each title
    put its best foot forward for every member and thus improve our member experience.</p><h2>Challenges</h2><p>At
    Netflix, we embrace personalization and algorithmically adapt many aspects of
    our member experience, including the <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/learning-a-personalized-homepage-aa8ec670359a">rows
    we select for the homepage</a>, the <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/netflix-recommendations-beyond-the-5-stars-part-2-d9b96aa399f5">titles
    we select for those rows</a>, the galleries we display, the messages we send,
    and so forth. Each new aspect that we personalize has unique challenges; personalizing
    the artwork we display is no exception and presents different personalization
    challenges. One challenge of image personalization is that we can <em>only</em>
    select a <em>single</em> piece of artwork to represent each title in each place
    we present it. In contrast, typical recommendation settings let us present <em>multiple
    selections</em> to a member where we can subsequently learn about their preferences
    from the item a member selects. This means that image selection is a chicken-and-egg
    problem operating in a closed loop: if a member plays a title it can only come
    from the image that we decided to present to that member. What we seek to understand
    is <em>when</em> presenting a specific piece of artwork for a title <em>influenced</em>
    a member to play (or not to play) a title and <em>when</em> a member would have
    played a title (or not) <em>regardless</em> of which image we presented. Therefore
    artwork personalization sits on top of the traditional recommendation problem
    and the algorithms need to work in conjunction with each other. Of course, to
    properly learn how to personalize artwork we need to collect <em>a lot</em> of
    data to find signals that indicate when one piece of artwork is significantly
    better for a member.</p><p>Another challenge is to understand the impact of changing
    artwork that we show a member for a title between sessions. Does changing artwork
    reduce recognizability of the title and make it difficult to visually locate the
    title again, for example if the member thought was interested before but had not
    yet watched it? Or, does changing the artwork itself lead the member to reconsider
    it due to an improved selection? Clearly, if we find better artwork to present
    to a member we should probably use it; but continuous changes can also confuse
    people. Changing images also introduces an attribution problem as it becomes unclear
    which image led a member to be interested in a title.</p><p>Next, there is the
    challenge of understanding how artwork performs in relation to other artwork we
    select in the same page or session. Maybe a bold close-up of the main character
    works for a title on a page because it stands out compared to the other artwork.
    But if every title had a similar image then the page as a whole may not seem as
    compelling. Looking at each piece of artwork in isolation may not be enough and
    we need to think about how to select a diverse set of images across titles on
    a page and across a session. Beyond the artwork for other titles, the effectiveness
    of the artwork for a title may depend on what other types of evidence and assets
    (e.g. synopses, trailers, etc.) we also display for that title. Thus, we may need
    a diverse selection where each can highlight complementary aspects of a title
    that may be compelling to a member.</p><p>To achieve effective personalization,
    we also need a good pool of artwork for each title. This means that we need several
    assets where each is engaging, informative and representative of a title to avoid
    “clickbait”. The set of images for a title also needs to be diverse enough to
    cover a wide potential audience interested in different aspects of the content.
    After all, how engaging and informative a piece of artwork is truly depends on
    the individual seeing it. Therefore, we need to have artwork that highlights not
    only different themes in a title but also different aesthetics. Our teams of artists
    and designers strive to create images that are diverse across many dimensions.
    They also take into consideration the personalization algorithms which will select
    the images during their creative process for generating artwork.</p><p>Finally,
    there are engineering challenges to personalize artwork at scale. One challenge
    is that our member experience is very visual and thus contains a lot of imagery.
    So using personalized selection for each asset means handling a peak of over 20
    million requests per second with low latency. Such a system must be robust: failing
    to properly render the artwork in our UI brings a significantly degrades the experience.
    Our personalization algorithm also needs to respond quickly when a title launches,
    which means rapidly learning to personalize in a cold-start situation. Then, after
    launch, the algorithm must continuously adapt as the effectiveness of artwork
    may change over time as both the title evolves through its life cycle and member
    tastes evolve.</p><h2>Contextual bandits approach</h2><p>Much of the Netflix recommendation
    engine is powered by machine learning algorithms. Traditionally, we collect a
    batch of data on how our members use the service. Then we run a new machine learning
    algorithm on this batch of data. Next we test this new algorithm against the current
    production system through an <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/its-all-a-bout-testing-the-netflix-experimentation-platform-4e1ca458c15">A/B
    test</a>. An A/B test helps us see if the new algorithm is better than our current
    production system by trying it out on a random subset of members. Members in group
    A get the current production experience while members in group B get the new algorithm.
    If members in group B have higher engagement with Netflix, then we roll-out the
    new algorithm to the entire member population. Unfortunately, this batch approach
    incurs regret: many members over a long period of time did not benefit from the
    better experience. This is illustrated in the figure below.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*HbJ4JXAAzT12eC05."
    alt=""></p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*A9oLAJuerO897OKM."
    alt=""></p><p>To reduce this regret, we move away from batch machine learning
    and consider online machine learning. For artwork personalization, the specific
    online learning framework we use is <em>contextual bandits</em>. Rather than waiting
    to collect a full batch of data, waiting to learn a model, and then waiting for
    an A/B test to conclude, contextual bandits rapidly figure out the optimal personalized
    artwork selection for a title for each member and context. Briefly, contextual
    bandits are a class of online learning algorithms that trade off the cost of gathering
    training data required for learning an unbiased model on an ongoing basis with
    the benefits of applying the learned model to each member context. In our <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/selecting-the-best-artwork-for-videos-through-a-b-testing-f6155c4595f6">previous
    unpersonalized image selection work</a>, we used non-contextual bandits where
    we found the winning image regardless of the context. For personalization, the
    member is the <em>context</em> as we expect different members to respond differently
    to the images.</p><p>A key property of contextual bandits is that they are designed
    to <em>minimize</em> regret. At a high level, the training data for a contextual
    bandit is obtained through the injection of controlled randomization in the learned
    model’s predictions. The randomization schemes can vary in complexity from simple
    epsilon-greedy formulations with uniform randomness to closed loop schemes that
    adaptively vary the degree of randomization as a function of model uncertainty.
    We broadly refer to this process as <em>data exploration</em>. The number of candidate
    artworks that are available for a title along with the size of the overall population
    for which the system will be deployed informs the choice of the data exploration
    strategy. With such exploration, we need to log information about the randomization
    for each artwork selection. This logging allows us to correct for skewed selection
    propensities and thereby perform offline model evaluation in an unbiased fashion,
    as described later.</p><p>Exploration in contextual bandits typically has a cost
    (or regret) due to the fact that our artwork selection in a member session may
    not use the predicted best image for that session. What impact does this randomization
    have on the member experience (and consequently on our metrics)? With over a hundred
    millions members, the regret incurred by exploration is typically very small and
    is amortized across our large member base with each member implicitly helping
    provide feedback on artwork for a small portion of the catalog. This makes the
    cost of exploration per member negligible, which is an important consideration
    when choosing contextual bandits to drive a key aspect of our member experience.
    Randomization and exploration with contextual bandits would be less suitable if
    the cost of exploration were high.</p><p>Under our online exploration scheme,
    we obtain a training dataset that records, for each (member, title, image) tuple,
    whether that selection resulted in a play of the title or not. Furthermore, we
    can control the exploration such that artwork selections do not change too often.
    This gives a cleaner attribution of the member’s engagement to specific artwork.
    We also carefully determine the label for each observation by looking at the quality
    of engagement to avoid learning a model that recommends “clickbait” images: ones
    that entice a member to start playing but ultimately result in low-quality engagement.</p><h3>Model
    training</h3><p>In this online learning setting, we train our contextual bandit
    model to select the best artwork for each member based on their context. We typically
    have up to a few dozen candidate artwork images per title. To learn the selection
    model, we can consider a simplification of the problem by ranking images for a
    member independently across titles. Even with this simplification we can still
    learn member image preferences across titles because, for every image candidate,
    we have some members who were presented with it and engaged with the title and
    some members who were presented with it and did not engage. These preferences
    can be modeled to predict for each (member, title, image) tuple, the probability
    that the member will enjoy a quality engagement. These can be supervised learning
    models or contextual bandit counterparts with Thompson Sampling, LinUCB, or Bayesian
    methods that intelligently balance making the best prediction with data exploration.</p><h3>Potential
    signals</h3><p>In contextual bandits, the context is usually represented as an
    feature vector provided as input to the model. There are many signals we can use
    as features for this problem. In particular, we can consider many attributes of
    the member: the titles they’ve played, the genre of the titles, interactions of
    the member with the specific title, their country, their language preferences,
    the device that the member is using, the time of day and the day of week. Since
    our algorithm selects images in conjunction with our personalized recommendation
    engine, we can also use signals regarding what our various recommendation algorithms
    think of the title, irrespective of what image is used to represent it.</p><p>An
    important consideration is that some images are naturally better than others in
    the candidate pool. We observe the overall <em>take rates</em> for all the images
    in our data exploration, which is simply the number of quality plays divided by
    the number of impressions. Our previous work on unpersonalized artwork selection
    used overall differences in take rates to determine the single best image to select
    for a whole population. In our new contextual personalized model, the overall
    take rates are still important and personalization still recovers selections that
    agree on average with the unpersonalized model’s ranking.</p><h3>Image Selection</h3><p>The
    optimal assignment of image artwork to a member is a selection problem to find
    the best candidate image from a title’s pool of available images. Once the model
    is trained as above, we use it to rank the images for each context. The model
    predicts the probability of play for a given image in a given a member context.
    We sort a candidate set of images by these probabilities and pick the one with
    the highest probability. That is the image we present to that particular member.</p><h2>Performance
    evaluation</h2><h3>Offline</h3><p>To evaluate our contextual bandit algorithms
    prior to deploying them online on real members, we can use an offline technique
    known as <em>replay</em> [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1935878">1</a>].
    This method allows us to answer counterfactual questions based on the logged exploration
    data (Figure 1). In other words, we can compare offline what would have happened
    in historical sessions under different scenarios if we had used different algorithms
    in an unbiased way.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3098/0*gcQNqEUdCfWMTv0i."

    have engaged with our titles if we had hypothetically presented images that were
    selected through a new algorithm rather than the algorithm used in production.
    For images, we are interested in several metrics, particularly the take fraction,
    as described above. Figure 2 shows how contextual bandit approach helps increase
    the average take fraction across the catalog compared to random selection or non-contextual
    bandits.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4756/1*ROJehtHmCLHE2yI4ay0M8g.png"

    experimenting with many different models offline and finding ones that had a substantial
    increase in replay, we ultimately ran an A/B test to compare the most promising
    personalized contextual bandits against unpersonalized bandits. As we suspected,
    the personalization worked and generated a significant lift in our core metrics.
    We also saw a reasonable correlation between what we measured offline in replay
    and what we saw online with the models. The online results also produced some
    interesting insights. For example, the improvement of personalization was larger
    in cases where the member had no prior interaction with the title. This makes
    sense because we would expect that the artwork would be more important to someone
    when a title is less familiar.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>With this approach, we’ve
    taken our first steps in personalizing the selection of artwork for our recommendations
    and across our service. This has resulted in a meaningful improvement in how our
    members discover new content… so we’ve rolled it out to everyone! This project
    is the first instance of personalizing not just what we recommend but also how
    we recommend to our members. But there are many opportunities to expand and improve
    this initial approach. These opportunities include developing algorithms to handle
    cold-start by personalizing new images and new titles as quickly as possible,
    for example by using techniques from computer vision. Another opportunity is extending
    this personalization approach across other types of artwork we use and other evidence
    that describe our titles such as synopses, metadata, and trailers. There is also
    an even broader problem: helping artists and designers figure out what new imagery
    we should add to the set to make a title even more compelling and personalizable.</p><p>If

    alt=""></p><p><em>This is the second in a <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/react-native-at-airbnb-f95aa460be1c">series
    of blog posts</a> in which we outline our experience with React Native and what
    is next for mobile at Airbnb.</em></p><p>React Native itself is a relatively new
    and fast-moving platform in the cross-section of Android, iOS, web, and cross-platform
    frameworks. After two years, we can safely say that React Native is revolutionary
    in many ways. It is a paradigm shift for mobile and we were able to reap the benefits
    of many of its goals. However, its benefits didn’t come without significant pain
    points.</p><h2>What Worked Well</h2><h3>Cross-Platform</h3><p>The primary benefit
    of React Native is the fact that code you write runs natively on Android and iOS.
    Most features that used React Native were able to achieve <em>95–100% shared code
    *and</em> 0.2% of files were platform-specific* (<em>.android.js/</em>.ios.js).</p><h3>Unified
    Design Language System (DLS)</h3><p>We developed a cross-platform design language
    called <a href="https://airbnb.design/building-a-visual-language/">DLS</a>. We
    have Android, iOS, React Native, and web versions of every component. Having a
    unified design language was amenable to writing cross-platform features because
    it meant that designs, component names, and screens were consistent across platforms.
    However, we were still able to make platform-appropriate decisions where applicable.
    For example, we use the native <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/Toolbar">Toolbar</a>
    on Android and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationbar">UINavigationBar</a>
    on iOS and we chose to hide <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/views/tables/">disclosure
    indicators</a> on Android because they don’t adhere to the Android platform design
    guidelines.</p><p>We opted to rewrite components instead of wrapping native ones
    because it was more reliable to make platform-appropriate APIs individually for
    each platform and reduced the maintenance overhead for Android and iOS engineers
    who may not know how to properly test changes in React Native. However, it did
    cause fragmentation between the platforms in which native and React Native versions
    of the same component would get out of sync.</p><h3>React</h3><p>There is a reason
    that React is the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-frameworks-libraries-and-tools">most-loved</a>
    web framework. It is simple yet powerful and scales well to large codebases. Some
    of the things we particularly like are:</p><ul><li><p>*<em>Components: *</em>React
    Components enforce separation of concerns with well-defined props and state. This
    is a major contributor to React’s scalability.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Simplified
    Lifecycles: *</em>Android and, to a slightly lesser extent, iOS lifecycles are
    notoriously <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fRxIQ.png">complex</a>. Functional
    reactive React components fundamentally solve this problem and made learning React
    Native dramatically simpler than learning Android or iOS.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Declarative:
    *</em>The declarative nature of React helped keep our UI in sync with the underlying
    state.</p></li></ul><h3>Iteration Speed</h3><p>While developing in React Native,
    we were able to reliably use <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2016/03/24/introducing-hot-reloading.html">hot
    reloading</a> to test our changes on Android and iOS in just a second or two.
    Even though build performance is a top priority for our native apps, it has never
    come close to the iteration speed we achieved with React Native. At best, native
    compilation times are 15 seconds but can be as high as 20 minutes for full builds.</p><h3>Investing
    in Infrastructure</h3><p>We developed extensive integrations into our native infrastructure.
    All core pieces such as networking, i18n, experimentation, shared element transitions,
    device info, account info, and many others were wrapped in a single React Native
    API. These bridges were some of the more complex pieces because we wanted to wrap
    the existing Android and iOS APIs into something that was consistent and canonical
    for React. While keeping these bridges up to date with the rapid iteration and
    development of new infrastructure was a constant game of catch up, the investment
    by the infrastructure team made product work much easier.</p><p>Without this heavy
    investment in infrastructure, React Native would have led to a subpar developer
    and user experiences. As a result, we don’t believe React Native can be simply
    tacked on to an existing app without a significant and continuous investment.</p><h3>Performance</h3><p>One
    of the largest concerns around React Native was its performance. However, in practice,
    this was rarely a problem. Most of our React Native screens feel as fluid as our
    native ones. Performance is often thought of in a single dimension. We frequently
    saw mobile engineers look at JS and think “slower than Java”. However, moving
    business logic and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/yoga">layout</a> off of
    the main thread actually improves render performance in many cases.</p><p>When
    we did see performance issues, they were usually caused by excessive rendering
    and were mitigated by effectively using <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#shouldcomponentupdate">shouldComponentUpdate</a>,
    <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/view.html#removeclippedsubviews">removeClippedSubviews</a>,
    and better use of Redux.</p><p>However, the initialization and first-render time
    (outlined below) made React Native perform poorly for launch screens, deeplinks,
    and increased the TTI time while navigating between screens. In addition, screens
    that dropped frames were difficult to debug because <a href="https://github.com/facebook/yoga">Yoga</a>
    translates between React Native components and native views.</p><h3>Redux</h3><p>We
    used <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> for state management which we found
    effective and prevented the UI from ever getting out of sync with state and enabled
    easy data sharing across screens. However, Redux is notorious for its boilerplate
    and has a relatively difficult learning curve. We provided generators for some
    common templates but it was still one of the most challenging pieces and source
    of confusion while working with React Native. It is worth noting that these challenges
    were not React Native specific.</p><h3>Backed by Native</h3><p>Because everything
    in React Native can be bridged by native code, we were ultimately able to build
    many things we weren’t sure were possible at the beginning such as:</p><ol><li><p><em>Shared
    element transitions</em>: We built a *<SharedElement> *component that is backed
    by native shared element code on Android and iOS. This even works between native
    and React Native screens.</p></li><li><p><em>Lottie:</em> We were able to get
    Lottie working in React Native by wrapping the existing libraries on Android and
    iOS.</p></li><li><p><em>Native networking stack:</em> React Native uses our existing
    native networking stack and cache on both platforms.</p></li><li><p>*Other core
    infra: *Just like networking, we wrapped the rest of our existing native infrastructure
    such as i18n, experimentation, etc. so that it worked seamlessly in React Native.</p></li></ol><h3>Static
    Analysis</h3><p>We have a <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript">strong
    history of using eslint</a> on web which we were able to leverage. However, we
    were the first platform at Airbnb to pioneer <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier">prettier</a>.
    We found it to be effective at reducing nits and bikeshedding on PRs. Prettier
    is now being actively investigated by our web infrastructure team.</p><p>We also
    used analytics to measure render times and performance to figure out which screens
    were the top priority to investigate for performance issues.</p><p>Because React
    Native was smaller and newer than our web infrastructure, it proved to be a good
    testbed for new ideas. Many of the tools and ideas we created for React Native
    are being adopted by web now.</p><h3>Animations</h3><p>Thanks to the React Native
    <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html">Animated</a>
    library, we were able to achieve jank-free animations and even interaction-driven
    animations such as scrolling parallax.</p><h3>JS/React Open Source</h3><p>Because
    React Native truly runs React and javascript, we were able to leverage the extremely
    vast array of javascript projects such as redux, reselect, jest, etc.</p><h3>Flexbox</h3><p>React
    Native handles layout with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/yoga">Yoga</a>,
    a cross-platform C library that handles layout calculations via the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp">flexbox</a>
    API. Early on, we were hit with Yoga limitations such as the lack of aspect ratios
    but they have been added in subsequent updates. Plus, fun tutorials such as <a
    href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">flexbox froggy</a> made onboarding more enjoyable.</p><h3>Collaboration
    with Web</h3><p>Late in the React Native exploration, we began building for web,
    iOS, and Android at once. Given that web also uses Redux, we found large swaths
    of code that could be shared across web and native platforms with no alterations.</p><h2>What
    didn’t work well</h2><h3>React Native Immaturity</h3><p>React Native is less mature
    than Android or iOS. It is newer, highly ambitious, and moving extremely quickly.
    While React Native works well in most situations, there are instances in which
    its immaturity shows through and makes something that would be trivial in native
    very difficult. Unfortunately, these instances are hard to predict and can take
    anywhere from hours to many days to work around.</p><h3>Maintaining a Fork of
    React Native</h3><p>Due to React Native’s immaturity, there were times in which
    we needed to patch the React Native source. In addition to contributing back to
    React Native, we had to <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/react-native/commits/0.46-canary">maintain
    a fork</a> in which we could quickly merge changes and bump our version. Over
    the two years, we had to add roughly 50 commits on top of React Native. This makes
    the process of upgrading React Native extremely painful.</p><h3>JavaScript Tooling</h3><p>JavaScript
    is an untyped language. The lack of type safety was both difficult to scale and
    became a point of contention for mobile engineers used to typed languages who
    may have otherwise been interested in learning React Native. We explored adopting
    <a href="https://flow.org/">flow</a> but cryptic error messages led to a frustrating
    developer experience. We also explored <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>
    but integrating it into our existing infrastructure such as <a href="https://babeljs.io/">babel</a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/metro">metro bundler</a> proved to be
    problematic. However, we are continuing to actively investigate TypeScript on
    web.</p><h3>Refactoring</h3><p>A side-effect of JavaScript being untyped is that
    refactoring was extremely difficult and error-prone. Renaming props, especially
    props with a common name like <em>onClick</em> or props that are passed through
    multiple components were a nightmare to refactor accurately. To make matters worse,
    the refactors broke in production instead of at compile time and were hard to
    add proper static analysis for.</p><h3>JavaScriptCore inconsistencies</h3><p>One
    subtle and tricky aspect of React Native is due to the fact that it is executed
    on a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/javascript-environment.html">JavaScriptCore
    environment</a>. The following are consequences we encountered as a result:</p><ul><li><p>iOS
    ships with its own <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore">JavaScriptCore
    out of the box</a>. This meant that iOS was mostly consistent and not problematic
    for us.</p></li><li><p>Android doesn’t ship its own JavaScriptCore so React Native
    bundles its own. However, the one you get by default <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/10245">is
    ancient</a>. As a result, we had to go out of our way to bundle a <a href="https://github.com/react-community/jsc-android-buildscripts">newer
    one</a>.</p></li><li><p>While debugging, React Native attaches to a Chrome Developer
    Tools instance. This is great because it is a powerful debugger. However, once
    the debugger is attached, all JavaScript runs within Chrome’s V8 engine. This
    is fine 99.9% of the time. However, in one instance, we got bit when toLocaleString
    worked on iOS but only worked on Android while debugging. It turns out that the
    Android JSC <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/15717">doesn’t
    include it</a> and it was silently failing unless you were debugging in which
    case it was using V8 which does. Without knowing technical details like this,
    it can lead to days of painful debugging for product engineers.</p></li></ul><h3>React
    Native Open Source Libraries</h3><p>Learning a platform is difficult and time-consuming.
    Most people only know one or two platforms well. React Native libraries that have
    native bridges such as maps, video, etc. requires equal knowledge of all three
    platforms to be successful. We found that most React Native Open source projects
    were written by people who had experience with only one or two. This led to inconsistencies
    or unexpected bugs on Android or iOS.</p><p>On Android, many React Native libraries
    also require you to use a relative path to node_modules rather than publishing
    maven artifacts which are inconsistent with what is expected by the community.</p><h3>Parallel
    Infrastructure and Feature Work</h3><p>We have accumulated many years of native
    infrastructure on Android and iOS. However, in React Native, we started with a
    blank slate and had to write or create bridges of all existing infrastructure.
    This meant that there were times in which a product engineer needed some functionality
    that didn’t yet exist. At that point, they either had to work in a platform they
    were unfamiliar with and outside the scope of their project to build it or be
    blocked until it could be created.</p><h3>Crash Monitoring</h3><p>We use <a href="https://www.bugsnag.com/">Bugsnag</a>
    for crash reporting on Android and iOS. While we were able to get Bugsnag generally
    working on both platforms, it was less reliable and required more work than it
    did on our other platforms. Because React Native is relatively new and rare in
    the industry, we had to build a significant amount of infrastructure such as uploading
    source maps in-house and had to work with Bugsnag to be able to do things like
    filter crashes by just those that occurred in React Native.</p><p>Due to the amount
    of custom infrastructure around React Native, we would occasionally have serious
    issues in which crashes weren’t reported or source maps weren’t properly uploaded.</p><p>Finally,
    debugging React Native crashes were often more challenging if the issue spanned
    React Native and native code since stack traces don’t jump between React Native
    and native.</p><h3>Native Bridge</h3><p>React Native has a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/communication-ios.html">bridge
    API</a> to communicate between native and React Native. While it works as expected,
    it is extremely cumbersome to write. Firstly, it requires all three development
    environments to be properly set up. We also experienced many issues in which the
    types coming from JavaScript were unexpected. For example, integers were often
    wrapped by strings, an issue that isn’t realized until it is passed over a bridge.
    To make matters worse, sometimes iOS will fail silently while Android will crash.
    We began to investigate automatically generating bridge code from TypeScript definitions
    towards the end of 2017 but it was too little too late.</p><h3>Initialization
    Time</h3><p>Before React Native can render for the first time, you must initialize
    its runtime. Unfortunately, this takes several seconds for an app of our size,
    even on a high-end device. This made using React Native for launch screens nearly
    impossible. We minimized the first-render time for React Native by initializing
    it at app-launch.</p><h3>Initial Render Time</h3><p>Unlike with native screens,
    rendering React Native requires at least one full main thread -&gt; js -&gt; yoga
    layout thread -&gt; main thread round trip before there is enough information
    to render a screen for the first time. We saw an average initial p90 render of
    280ms on iOS and 440ms on Android. On Android, we used the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#postponeEnterTransition()">postponeEnterTransition</a>
    API which is normally used for shared element transitions to delay showing the
    screen until it has rendered. On iOS, we had issues setting the navbar configuration
    from React Native fast enough. As a result, we added an artificial delay of 50ms
    to all React Native screen transitions to prevent the navbar from flickering once
    the configuration was loaded.</p><h3>App Size</h3><p>React Native also has a non-negligible
    impact on app size. On Android, the total size of React Native (Java + JS + native
    libraries such as Yoga + Javascript Runtime) was 8mb per ABI. With both x86 and
    arm (32 bit only) in one APK, it would have been closer to 12mb.</p><h3>64-bit</h3><p>We
    still can’t ship a 64-bit APK on Android because of <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/2814">this</a>
    issue.</p><h3>Gestures</h3><p>We avoided using React Native for screens that involved
    complex gestures because the touch subsystem for Android and iOS are different
    enough that coming up with a unified API has been challenging for the entire React
    Native community. However, work is continuing to progress and <a href="https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler">react-native-gesture-handler</a>
    just hit 1.0.</p><h3>Long Lists</h3><p>React Native has made some progress in
    this area with libraries like <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist.html">FlatList</a>.
    However, they are nowhere near the maturity and flexibility of <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview">RecyclerView</a>
    on Android or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionview">UICollectionView</a>
    on iOS. Many of the limitations are difficult to overcome because of the threading.
    Adapter data can’t be accessed synchronously so it is possible to see views flash
    in as they get asynchronously rendered while scrolling quickly. Text also can’t
    be measured synchronously so iOS can’t make certain optimizations with pre-computed
    cell heights.</p><h3>Upgrading React Native</h3><p>Although most React Native
    upgrades were trivial, there were a few that wound up being painful. In particular,
    it was nearly impossible to use React Native 0.43 (April 2017) to 0.49 (October
    2017) because it used React 16 alpha and beta. This was hugely problematic because
    most React libraries that are designed for web use don’t support pre-release React
    versions. The process of wrangling the proper dependencies for this upgrade was
    a major detriment to other React Native infrastructure work in mid-2017.</p><h3>Accessibility</h3><p>In
    2017, we did a major <a href="https://airbnb.design/designing-for-access/">accessibility
    overhaul</a> in which we invested significant efforts to ensure that people with
    disabilities can use Airbnb to book a listing that can accommodate their needs.
    However, there were many holes in the React Native accessibility APIs. In order
    to meet even a minimum acceptable accessibility bar, we had to <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/react-native/commits/0.46-canary">maintain
    our own fork</a> of React Native where we could merge fixes. For these case, a
    one-line fix on Android or iOS wound up taking days of figuring out how to add
    it to React Native, cherry picking it, then filing an issue on React Native core
    and following up on it over the coming weeks.</p><h3>Troublesome Crashes</h3><p>We
    have had to deal with a few very bizarre crashes that are hard to fix. For example,
    we are currently experiencing <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37045084">this
    crash</a> on the <em>@ReactProp</em> annotation and have been unable to reproduce
    it on any device, even those with identical hardware and software to ones that
    are crashing in the wild.</p><h3>SavedInstanceState Across Processes on Android</h3><p>Android
    frequently cleans up background processes but gives them a chance to <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/saving-states#use_onsaveinstancestate_as_backup_to_handle_system_initiated_process_death">synchronously
    save their state in a bundle</a>. However, on React Native, all state is only
    accessible in the js thread so this can’t be done synchronously. Even if this
    weren’t the case, redux as a state store is not compatible with this approach
    because it contains a mix of serializable and non-serializable data and may contain
    more data than can fit within the savedInstanceState bundle which would lead to

  :title: Eleven Reasons To Be Excited About The Future of Technology
  :content: '<p>“The strongest force propelling human progress has been the swift
    advance and wide diffusion of technology.” — The Economist</p><p>In the year 1820,
    a person could <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/">expect to
    live</a> less than 35 years, 94% of the global population <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-poverty/">lived
    in extreme poverty</a>, and less that 20% of the population was literate. Today,
    human life expectancy is over 70 years, less that 10% of the global population
    lives in extreme poverty, and <a href="http://www.oecd.org/statistics/How-was-life.pdf">over
    80% of people</a> are literate. These improvements are due mainly to advances
    in technology, beginning in the industrial age and continuing today in the information
    age.</p><p>There are many exciting new technologies that will continue to transform
    the world and improve human welfare. Here are eleven of them.</p><h2>1. Self-Driving
    Cars</h2><p>Self-driving cars exist today that are safer than human-driven cars
    in most driving conditions. Over the next 3–5 years they‘ll get even safer, and
    will begin to go mainstream.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*HfoJs9tCyyr6VeLvD45wyQ.gif"
    alt=""></p><p>The <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs358/en/">World
    Health Organization estimates</a> that 1.25 million people die from car-related
    injuries per year. Half of the deaths are pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists
    hit by cars. Cars are the leading cause of death for people ages 15–29 years old.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*SNGdeK4GNUhjL6wlh7sfJw.png" alt=""></p><p>Just
    as cars reshaped the world in the 20th century, so will self-driving cars in the
    21st century. In most cities, <a href="http://oldurbanist.blogspot.com.es/2011/12/we-are-25-looking-at-street-area.html">between
    20–30%</a> of usable space is taken up by parking spaces, and most cars are parked
    <a href="http://www.reinventingparking.org/2013/02/cars-are-parked-95-of-time-lets-check.html">about
    95%</a> of the time. Self-driving cars will be in almost continuous use (most
    likely hailed from a smartphone app), thereby dramatically reducing the need for
    parking. Cars will communicate with one another to avoid accidents and traffic
    jams, and riders will be able to spend commuting time on other activities like
    work, education, and socializing.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*k6w2wkkREpVeu9_cS2xxtg.png"

    by reducing the demand for energy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption">haven’t
    worked</a>. Fortunately, scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs have been working
    hard on the supply side to make clean energy convenient and cost-effective.</p><p>Due
    to steady technological and manufacturing advances, the price of solar cells has
    <a href="http://www.saskwind.ca/wind-cost-decline/">dropped 99.5% since 1977</a>.
    Solar will soon be more cost efficient than fossil fuels. The cost of wind energy
    has also dropped to an all-time low, and in the last decade represented about
    a <a href="http://energy.gov/articles/top-10-things-you-didnt-know-about-wind-power">third
    of newly installed</a> US energy capacity.</p><p>Forward thinking organizations
    are taking advantage of this. For example, in India there is an initiative to
    convert airports to self-sustaining clean energy.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*idAW1ONI_iIeevzPaUv-pg.png"

    Drones and Flying Cars</h2><blockquote><h1>“Roads? Where we’re going we don’t
    need… roads.” — Dr. Emmet Brown</h1></blockquote><p>GPS started out as a military
    technology but is now used to hail taxis, get mapping directions, and hunt Pokémon.
    Likewise, drones started out as a military technology, but are increasingly being
    used for a wide range of consumer and commercial applications.</p><p>For example,
    drones are being used to inspect critical infrastructure like bridges and power
    lines, to survey areas struck by natural disasters, and many other creative uses
    like fighting animal poaching.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*hLhAdWXECMyNLwrHfad6pA.png"

    Artificial Intelligence</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*I2dRn7D8ZZM7nI2IvvMFDw.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><blockquote><p>‘’It may be a hundred years before a computer beats
    humans at Go — maybe even longer.” — <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/29/science/to-test-a-powerful-computer-play-an-ancient-game.html?pagewanted=all">New

    New York Times, 2016</a></p></blockquote><p>Artificial intelligence has made rapid
    advances in the last decade, due to new algorithms and massive increases in data
    collection and computing power.</p><p>AI can be applied to almost any field. For
    example, in photography an AI technique called artistic style transfer transforms
    photographs into the style of a given painter:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*aHFJuj-jhnP4zHY1dD7tRA.png"

    built an AI system that controls its datacenter power systems, saving hundreds

    broad promise of AI is to liberate people from repetitive mental tasks the same
    way the industrial revolution liberated people from repetitive physical tasks.</p><blockquote><p>“If
    AI can help humans become better chess players, it stands to reason that it can
    help us become better pilots, better doctors, better judges, better teachers.”
    — <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/future-of-artificial-intelligence/">Kevin
    Kelly</a></p></blockquote><p>Some people worry that AI will destroy jobs. History
    has shown that while new technology does indeed eliminate jobs, it also creates
    new and better jobs to replace them. For example, with advent of the personal
    computer, the number of typographer jobs dropped, but the increase in graphic
    designer jobs more than made up for it.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*c_lt2s5TuSoOfmPb_Rv46w.png"

    away than new jobs that will be created. Today millions of people work as app
    developers, ride-sharing drivers, drone operators, and social media marketers—
    jobs that didn’t exist and would have been difficult to even imagine ten years
    ago.</p><h2>6. Pocket Supercomputers for Everyone</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*5tt6F_Cxnf5n7J5v6Lx0Ug.png"

    Diamandis</a></p></blockquote><h2>7. Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains</h2><blockquote><h1>“If

    that they would have said a decentralized network of information nodes that are
    linked using hypertext.” — <a href="http://farmerandfarmer.org/mastery/builder.html">Farmer
    &amp; Farmer</a></h1></blockquote><p>Protocols are the plumbing of the internet.
    Most of the protocols we use today were developed decades ago by academia and
    government. Since then, protocol development mostly stopped as energy shifted
    to developing proprietary systems like social networks and messaging apps.</p><p>Cryptocurrency
    and blockchain technologies are <a href="http://avc.com/2016/07/the-golden-age-of-open-protocols/">changing
    this</a> by providing a new business model for internet protocols. This year alone,
    <a href="https://medium.com/the-coinbase-blog/app-coins-and-the-dawn-of-the-decentralized-business-model-8b8c951e734f#.2atvp1cxd">hundreds
    of millions of dollars</a> were raised for a broad range of innovative blockchain-based
    protocols.</p><p>Protocols based on blockchains also have capabilities that previous
    protocols didn’t. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum">Ethereum</a>
    is a new blockchain-based protocol that can be used to create smart contracts

    in the future will look at their holodecks and wearable virtual reality contact
    lenses and downloadable avatars and AI interfaces and say, “Oh, you didn’t really

    Right now, today, in 2016 is the best time to start up. There has never been a
    better day in the whole history of the world to invent something. There has never
    been a better time with more opportunities, more openings, lower barriers, higher
    benefit/ risk ratios, better returns, greater upside than now. Right now, this
    minute. This is the moment that folks in the future will look back at and say,
    “Oh, to have been alive and well back then!”</p></blockquote>'

  :title: 'Beyond Interactive: Notebook Innovation at Netflix'
  :content: '<p>By Michelle Ufford, M Pacer, Matthew Seal, and Kyle Kelley</p><p>Notebooks
    have rapidly grown in popularity among data scientists to become the de facto
    standard for quick prototyping and exploratory analysis. At Netflix, we’re pushing
    the boundaries even further, reimagining what a notebook can be, who can use it,
    and what they can do with it. And we’re making big investments to help make this
    vision a reality.</p><p>In this post, we’ll share our motivations and why we find
    Jupyter notebooks so compelling. We’ll also introduce components of our notebook
    infrastructure and explore some of the novel ways we’re using notebooks at Netflix.</p><p>If
    you’re short on time, we suggest jumping down to the Use Cases section.</p><h2>Motivations</h2><p>Data
    powers Netflix. It permeates our thoughts, informs our <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/its-all-a-bout-testing-the-netflix-experimentation-platform-4e1ca458c15">decisions</a>,
    and challenges our <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/selecting-the-best-artwork-for-videos-through-a-b-testing-f6155c4595f6">assumptions</a>.
    It fuels <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/a-b-testing-and-beyond-improving-the-netflix-streaming-experience-with-experimentation-and-data-5b0ae9295bdf">experimentation</a>
    and <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/growth-engineering-at-netflix-accelerating-innovation-90eb8e70ce59">innovation</a>
    at <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a20138/netflix-interview-wired-traffic-exceeds-internet-capacity/">unprecedented
    scale</a>. Data helps us discover <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/studio-production-data-science-646ee2cc21a1">fantastic
    content</a> and deliver <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/artwork-personalization-c589f074ad76">personalized
    experiences</a> for our 130 million members <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/using-machine-learning-to-improve-streaming-quality-at-netflix-9651263ef09f">around
    the world</a>.</p><p>Making this possible is no small feat; it requires extensive
    engineering and infrastructure support. Every day more than 1 trillion events
    are written into a streaming ingestion pipeline, which is processed and written
    to a 100PB cloud-native data warehouse. And every day, our users run more than
    150,000 jobs against this data, spanning everything from reporting and analysis
    to machine learning and recommendation algorithms. To support these use cases
    at such scale, we’ve built an industry-leading Data Platform which is flexible,
    powerful, and complex (by necessity). We’ve also built a rich ecosystem of complementary
    tools and services, such as <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/evolving-the-netflix-data-platform-with-genie-3-598021604dda">Genie</a>,
    a federated job execution service, and <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/metacat-making-big-data-discoverable-and-meaningful-at-netflix-56fb36a53520">Metacat</a>,
    a federated metastore. These tools simplify the complexity, making it possible
    to support a broader set of users across the company.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3122/1*Yzh8GbLOuY3-_rh2bMu9Bw.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>User diversity is exciting, but it comes at a cost: the Netflix
    Data Platform — and its ecosystem of tools and services — must scale to support
    additional use cases, languages, access patterns, and more. To better understand
    this problem, consider 3 common roles: analytics engineer, data engineer, and
    data scientist.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3234/1*NRoFl1l4lIVQAAvmBOKd4A.jpeg"
    alt="Example of how tooling &amp; language preferences may vary across roles"><em>Example
    of how tooling &amp; language preferences may vary across roles</em></p><p>Generally,
    each role relies on a different set of tools and languages. For example, a data
    engineer might create a new aggregate of a dataset containing trillions of streaming
    events — using Scala in IntelliJ. An analytics engineer might use that aggregate
    in a new report on global streaming quality — using SQL and Tableau. And that
    report might lead to a data scientist building a new streaming compression model
    — using R and RStudio. On the surface, these seem like disparate, albeit complementary,
    workflows. But if we delve deeper, we see that each of these workflows has multiple
    overlapping tasks:</p><p>*<em>data exploration — *</em>occurs early in a project;
    may include viewing sample data, running queries for statistical profiling and
    exploratory analysis, and visualizing data</p><p>*<em>data preparation *</em>—
    iterative task; may include cleaning, standardizing, transforming, denormalizing,
    and aggregating data; typically the most time-intensive task of a project</p><p>*<em>data
    validation *</em>— recurring task; may include viewing sample data, running queries
    for statistical profiling and aggregate analysis, and visualizing data; typically
    occurs as part of data exploration, data preparation, development, pre-deployment,
    and post-deployment phases</p><p><strong>productionalization</strong> — occurs
    late in a project; may include deploying code to production, backfilling datasets,
    training models, validating data, and scheduling workflows</p><p>To help our users
    scale, we want to make these tasks as effortless as possible. To help our platform
    scale, we want to minimize the number of tools we need to support. But how? No
    single tool could span all of these tasks; what’s more, a single task often requires
    multiple tools. When we add another layer of abstraction, however, a common pattern
    emerges across tools and languages: run code, explore data, present results.</p><p>As
    it happens, an open source project was designed to do precisely that: <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Project
    Jupyter</a>.</p><h2>Jupyter Notebooks</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2984/0*cgQX-JHRytjbeDNx"
    alt="Jupyter notebook rendered in nteract desktop featuring [Vega](https://vega.github.io/)

    nteract desktop featuring <a href="https://vega.github.io/">Vega</a> and <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/">Altair</a></em></p><p>Project
    Jupyter began in 2014 with a goal of creating a consistent set of open-source
    tools for scientific research, reproducible workflows, computational narratives,
    and data analytics. Those tools translated well to industry, and today Jupyter
    notebooks have become an essential part of the data scientist toolkit. To give
    you a sense of its impact, Jupyter was awarded the <a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-receives-the-acm-software-system-award-d433b0dfe3a2">2017
    ACM Software Systems Award</a> — a prestigious honor it shares with Java, Unix,
    and the Web.</p><p>To understand why the Jupyter notebook is so compelling for
    us, consider the core functionality it provides:</p><ul><li><p>a messaging protocol
    for introspecting and executing code which is language agnostic</p></li><li><p>an
    editable file format for describing and capturing code, code output, and markdown
    notes</p></li><li><p>a web-based UI for interactively writing and running code
    as well as visualizing outputs</p></li></ul><p>The Jupyter protocol provides a
    standard messaging API to communicate with kernels that act as computational engines.
    The protocol enables a composable architecture that separates where content is
    written (the UI) and where code is executed (the kernel). By isolating the runtime
    from the interface, notebooks can span multiple languages while maintaining flexibility
    in how the execution environment is configured. If a kernel exists for a language
    that knows how to communicate using the Jupyter protocol, notebooks can run code
    by sending messages back and forth with that kernel.</p><p>Backing all this is
    a file format that stores both code and results together. This means results can
    be accessed later without needing to rerun the code. In addition, the notebook
    stores rich prose to give context to what’s happening within the notebook. This
    makes it an ideal format for communicating business context, documenting assumptions,
    annotating code, describing conclusions, and more.</p><h2>Use Cases</h2><p>Of
    our many use cases, the most common ways we’re using notebooks today are: data
    access, notebook templates, and scheduling notebooks.</p><h3><strong>Data Access</strong></h3><p>Notebooks
    were first introduced at Netflix to support data science workflows. As their adoption
    grew among data scientists, we saw an opportunity to scale our tooling efforts.
    We realized we could leverage the versatility and architecture of Jupyter notebooks
    and extend it for general data access. In Q3 2017 we began this work in earnest,
    elevating notebooks from a niche tool to a first-class citizen of the Netflix
    Data Platform.</p><p>From our users’ perspective, notebooks offer a convenient
    interface for iteratively running code, exploring output, and visualizing data
    — all from a single cloud-based development environment. We also maintain a Python
    library that consolidates access to platform APIs. This means users have programmatic
    access to virtually the entire platform from within a notebook. Because of this
    combination of versatility, power, and ease of use, we’ve seen rapid organic adoption
    for all user types across our entire platform.</p><p>Today, notebooks are the
    most popular tool for working with data at Netflix.</p><h3><strong>Notebook Templates</strong></h3><p>As
    we expanded platform support for notebooks, we began to introduce new capabilities
    to meet new use cases. From this work emerged parameterized notebooks. A parameterized
    notebook is exactly what it sounds like: a notebook which allows you to specify
    parameters in your code and accept input values at runtime. This provides an excellent
    mechanism for users to define notebooks as reusable templates.</p><p>Our users
    have found a surprising number of uses for these templates. Some of the most common
    ones are:</p><ul><li><p>*<em>Data Scientist: *</em>run an experiment with different
    coefficients and summarize the results</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Engineer:</strong>
    execute a collection of data quality audits as part of the deployment process</p></li><li><p><strong>Data
    Analyst:</strong> share prepared queries and visualizations to enable a stakeholder
    to explore more deeply than Tableau allows</p></li><li><p><strong>Software Engineer:</strong>
    email the results of a troubleshooting script each time there’s a failure</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Scheduling
    Notebooks</strong></h3><p>One of the more novel ways we’re leveraging notebooks
    is as a unifying layer for scheduling workflows.</p><p>Since each notebook can
    run against an arbitrary kernel, we can support any execution environment a user
    has defined. And because notebooks describe a linear flow of execution, broken
    up by cells, we can map failure to particular cells. This allows users to describe
    a short narrative of execution and visualizations that we can accurately report
    against when running at a later point in time.</p><p>This paradigm means we can
    use notebooks for interactive work and smoothly move to scheduling that work to
    run recurrently. For users, this is very convenient. Many users construct an entire
    workflow in a notebook, only to have to copy/paste it into separate files for
    scheduling when they’re ready to deploy it. By treating notebooks as a logical
    workflow, we can easily schedule it the same as any other workflow.</p><p>We can
    schedule other types of work through notebooks, too. When a Spark or Presto job
    executes from the scheduler, the source code is injected into a newly-created
    notebook and executed. That notebook then becomes an immutable historical record,
    containing all related artifacts — including source code, parameters, runtime
    config, execution logs, error messages, and so on. When troubleshooting failures,
    this offers a quick entry point for investigation, as all relevant information
    is colocated and the notebook can be launched for interactive debugging.</p><h2>Notebook
    Infrastructure</h2><p>Supporting these use cases at Netflix scale requires extensive
    supporting infrastructure. Let’s briefly introduce some of the projects we’ll
    be talking about.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/nteract">**nteract</a>** is
    a next-gen React-based UI for Jupyter notebooks. It provides a simple, intuitive
    interface and offers several improvements over the classic Jupyter UI, such as
    inline cell toolbars, drag and droppable cells, and a built-in data explorer.</p><p><a
    href="https://github.com/nteract/papermill">**Papermill</a>** is a library for
    parameterizing, executing, and analyzing Jupyter notebooks. With it, you can spawn
    multiple notebooks with different parameter sets and execute them concurrently.
    Papermill can also help collect and summarize metrics from a collection of notebooks.</p><p><a
    href="https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/applications/commuter/README.md">**Commuter</a>**
    is a lightweight, vertically-scalable service for viewing and sharing notebooks.
    It provides a Jupyter-compatible version of the contents API and makes it trivial
    to read notebooks stored locally or on Amazon S3. It also offers a directory explorer
    for finding and sharing notebooks.</p><p><a href="https://netflix.github.io/titus/">**Titus</a>**
    is a container management platform that provides scalable and reliable container
    execution and cloud-native integration with Amazon AWS. Titus was built internally
    at Netflix and is used in production to power Netflix streaming, recommendation,
    and content systems.</p><p>We explore this architecture in our follow-up blog
    post, <a href="https://medium.com/@NetflixTechBlog/scheduling-notebooks-348e6c14cfd6">Scheduling
    Notebooks at Netflix</a>. For the purposes of this post, we’ll just introduce
    three of its fundamental components: storage, compute, and interface.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*WOEEJizYnO8ibtU2l9jWbA.jpeg" alt="Notebook
    Infrastructure at Netflix"><em>Notebook Infrastructure at Netflix</em></p><h3><strong>Storage</strong></h3><p>The
    Netflix Data Platform relies on Amazon S3 and EFS for cloud storage, which notebooks
    treat as virtual filesystems. This means each user has a home directory on EFS,
    which contains a personal workspace for notebooks. This workspace is where we
    store any notebook created or uploaded by a user. This is also where all reading
    and writing activity occurs when a user launches a notebook interactively. We
    rely on a combination of [workspace + filename] to form the notebook’s <em>namespace</em>,
    e.g. /efs/users/kylek/notebooks/MySparkJob.ipynb. We use this namespace for viewing,
    sharing, and scheduling notebooks. This convention prevents collisions and makes
    it easy to identify both the user and the location of the notebook in the EFS
    volume.</p><p>We can rely on the workspace path to abstract away the complexity
    of cloud-based storage from users. For example, only the filename of a notebook
    is displayed in directory listings, e.g. MySparkJob.ipynb. This same file is accessible
    at ~/notebooks/MySparkJob.ipynb from a terminal.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*pjjOIx1g7g4XoTxWBv0pIw.png"
    alt="Notebook storage vs. notebook access"><em>Notebook storage vs. notebook access</em></p><p>When
    the user schedules a notebook, the scheduler copies the user’s notebook from EFS
    to a common directory on S3. The notebook on S3 becomes the source of truth for
    the scheduler, or <em>source notebook</em>. Each time the scheduler runs a notebook,
    it instantiates a new notebook from the source notebook. This new notebook is
    what actually executes and becomes an immutable record of that execution, containing
    the code, output, and logs from each cell. We refer to this as the <em>output
    notebook</em>.</p><p>Collaboration is fundamental to how we work at Netflix. It
    came as no surprise then when users started sharing notebook URLs. As this practice
    grew, we ran into frequent problems with accidental overwrites caused by multiple
    people concurrently accessing the same notebook . Our users wanted a way to share
    their active notebook in a read-only state. This led to the creation of <a href="https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/master/applications/commuter">**Commuter</a>**.
    Behind the scenes, Commuter surfaces the Jupyter APIs for /files and /api/contents
    to list directories, view file contents, and access file metadata. This means
    users can safely view notebooks without affecting production jobs or live-running
    notebooks.</p><h3><strong>Compute</strong></h3><p>Managing compute resources is
    one of the most challenging parts of working with data. This is especially true
    at Netflix, where we employ a highly-scalable containerized architecture on AWS.
    All jobs on the Data Platform run on containers — including queries, pipelines,
    and notebooks. Naturally, we wanted to abstract away as much of this complexity
    as possible.</p><p>A container is provisioned when a user launches a notebook
    server. We provide reasonable defaults for container resources, which works for
    ~87.3% of execution patterns. When that’s not enough, users can request more resources
    using a simple interface.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2360/0*FUdkFk_m2tyeloJa"
    alt="Users can select as much or as little compute + memory as they need"><em>Users
    can select as much or as little compute + memory as they need</em></p><p>We also
    provide a unified execution environment with a prepared container image. The image
    has common libraries and an array of default kernels preinstalled. Not everything
    in the image is static — our kernels pull the most recent versions of Spark and
    the latest cluster configurations for our platform. This reduces the friction
    and setup time for new notebooks and generally keeps us to a single execution
    environment.</p><p>Under the hood we’re managing the orchestration and environments
    with <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/titus-the-netflix-container-management-platform-is-now-open-source-f868c9fb5436">Titus</a>,
    our Docker container management service. We further wrap that service by managing
    the user’s particular server configuration and image. The image also includes
    user security groups and roles, as well as common environment variables for identity
    within included libraries. This means our users can spend less time on infrastructure
    and more time on data.</p><h3><strong>Interface</strong></h3><p>Earlier we described
    our vision for notebooks to become the tool of choice for working with data. But
    this presents an interesting challenge: how can a single interface support all
    users? We don’t fully know the answer yet, but we have some ideas.</p><p>We know
    we want to lean into simplicity. This means an intuitive UI with a minimalistic
    aesthetic, and it also requires a thoughtful UX that makes it easy to do the hard
    things. This philosophy aligns well with the goals of <a href="https://github.com/nteract/nteract">**nteract</a>**,
    a React-based frontend for Jupyter notebooks. It emphasizes simplicity and <a
    href="https://components.nteract.io/">composability</a> as core design principles,
    which makes it an ideal building block for the work we want to do.</p><p>One of
    the most frequent complaints we heard from users is the lack of native data visualization
    across language boundaries, especially for non-Python languages. nteract’s <a
    href="https://blog.nteract.io/designing-the-nteract-data-explorer-f4476d53f897">Data
    Explorer</a> is a good example of how we can make the hard things simpler by providing
    a language-agnostic way to explore data quickly.</p><p>You can see Data Explorer

    alt="Native support for parameterized notebooks in nteract"><em>Native support
    for parameterized notebooks in nteract</em></p><p>Although notebooks are already
    offering a lot of value at Netflix, we’ve just begun. We know we need to <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/search?q=notebooks">make
    investments</a> in both the frontend and backend to improve the overall notebook
    experience. Our work over the next 12 months is focused on improving reliability,
    visibility, and collaboration. Context is paramount for users, which is why we’re
    increasing visibility into cluster status, kernel state, job history, and more.
    We’re also working on automatic version control, native in-app scheduling, better
    support for visualizing Spark DataFrames, and greater stability for our Scala
    kernel. We’ll go into more detail on this work in a future blog post.</p><h2>Open
    Source Projects</h2><p>Netflix has long been a proponent of open source. We value
    the energy, open standards, and exchange of ideas that emerge from open source
    collaborations. Many of the applications we developed for the Netflix Data Platform
    have already been open sourced through <a href="https://netflix.github.io/">Netflix
    OSS</a>. We are also intentional about not creating one-off solutions or succumbing
    to “Not Invented Here” mentality. Whenever possible, we leverage and contribute
    to existing open source projects, such as <a href="https://github.com/apache/spark">Spark</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/jupyter">Jupyter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas">pandas</a>.</p><p>The
    infrastructure we’ve described relies heavily on the Project Jupyter ecosystem,
    but there are some places where we diverge. Most notably, we have chosen <a href="https://github.com/nteract">**nteract</a>**
    as the notebook UI for Netflix. We made this decision for many reasons, including
    alignment with our technology stack and design philosophies. As we push the limits
    of what a notebook can do, we will likely create new tools, libraries, and services.
    These projects will also be open sourced as part of the nteract ecosystem.</p><p>We
    recognize that what makes sense for Netflix does not necessarily make sense for
    everyone. We have designed these projects with modularity in mind. This makes
    it possible to pick and choose only the components that make sense for your environment,
    e.g. Papermill, without requiring a commitment to the entire ecosystem.</p><h2>What’s
    Next</h2><p>As a platform team, our responsibility is to enable Netflixers to
    do amazing things with data. Notebooks are already having a dramatic impact at
    Netflix. With the significant investments we’re making in this space, we’re excited
    to see this impact grow. If you’d like to be a part of it, check out <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/search?q=notebooks">our
    job openings</a>.</p><p>Phew! Thanks for sticking with us through this long post.
    We’ve just scratched the surface of what we’re doing with notebooks. This post
    is part one in a series on notebooks at Netflix we’ll be releasing over the coming

  :title: Stop Saying Technology is Causing Social Isolation
  :content: '<p>Stop Saying Technology is Causing Social Isolation</p><p>A group of
    friends checking their smartphones while hanging out. Almost everyone on the subway
    with their eyes fixed on their gadget’s screens. A couple laying together in bed
    with their iPhones in their hands. People with their devices up in the air taking
    pictures of a concert. And I could go on. Technology, and especially smartphones,
    is ruining society, making us disconnected from others, interacting with our devices
    instead of with each other.</p><p>Except, fuck that.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2136/1*oRn8iwuHxO2wvj9tYIXU3Q.jpeg"
    alt="Illustration by [Rosangela Ludovico](http://hugtherobots.tumblr.com/post/69627090387/i-know-its-trendy-to-fight-the-system-and-cry)"><em>Illustration
    by <a href="http://hugtherobots.tumblr.com/post/69627090387/i-know-its-trendy-to-fight-the-system-and-cry">Rosangela
    Ludovico</a></em></p><p>People like to criticize current society. Not necessarily
    the current society relative to us, but the contemporary society of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_%28metaphor%29">time</a>
    they live in. It’s just so cool to romanticize the past even if <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/turning-straw-gold/201308/romanticizing-the-past-makes-us-feel-bad-about-the-present">it
    makes us feel bad about the present</a>. Past times were always better. And in
    this age of information and technology, in which the smartphone is so ubiquitous,
    it’s only obvious to blame them for some of society’s problems. Of course, it’s
    perfectly reasonable to stop and reflect on the use we give to technology and
    to criticize the bad behaviors associated. But I believe that accusing technology
    (and, again, especially smartphones) of ruining social interaction and even all
    kinds of experiences is, to say the least, quite wrong and misguided. Some people
    would even qualify that as pretentious, but I’ll refrain from that.</p><p>If you
    have used the internet in the last years (and I suspect you have), you have probably
    seen a picture on your Facebook feed or on your Tumblr dashboard or nearly everywhere
    pointing out, with a sense of superiority, how people are slaves of technology
    nowadays, always using their electronic devices in public. I’m talking about illustrations
    like <a href="http://azurea.tumblr.com/post/104686647920">these</a>. Or comics
    like <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/129-marc-maron-the-social-media-generation/">these</a>.
    Or short films like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OINa46HeWg8">these</a>.
    Or articles like <a href="http://www.popsugar.com/tech/Experiences-Better-Without-Smartphones-37636606">these</a>
    or <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/music/six-reasons-why-your-phone-is-probably-ruining-your-concert-experience-and-everyone-elses-6638538">these</a>.
    Or photographic projects like <a href="http://www.ericpickersgill.com/Removed">these</a>.
    Again, I could go on. The world wide web is filled with all kinds of expressive
    works related to this issue, probably because it’s something people care about.
    But I feel that most of that content treats it using the same premise: smartphones
    are ruining our lifes (at least to some extent).</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*0aGhIu5NxNgfXOFptwN4rw.jpeg"

    Jullien</a>. The fun people didn’t go away — they’re here and everywhere</em></p><p>Everytime
    I see content like that, I feel the need to express my profound disagreement,
    for which I usually resort to Twitter, always ending up wanting to say more than
    I could, so I decided to write this piece. Of course, this expresses my views
    (and, I hope, the views of many others) just like those authors whose works I’m
    commenting on, so you may disagree with me and find that they are right and I’m
    not.</p><p>My main premise is that I don’t think smartphones are isolating us,
    destroying our social lives or ruining interactions. I see smartphones as <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/11/9493425/technology-isnt-a-tool-its-an-instrument">instruments</a>
    for communication. Instruments that enable interaction on ways that just weren’t
    possible before, connecting us with people all around the world, via Twitter,
    instant messaging or other services. Some may say that if you want to interact
    with people, you should interact with the ones around you, and that is probably
    true on certain occasions. But, on other occasions, I’m just not able to comprehend
    why should we be forced to interact with those physically close to us instead
    of with the people that we <em>really</em> want to interact with.</p><p>Is it
    so bad to prefer talking with a long-distance partner using a smartphone than
    with someone who does not interest me but happens to be next to me? To prefer
    reading how the people you’ve followed by years on Twitter are doing instead of
    making smalltalk with that friend of a friend sitting across the subway car? Maybe
    you think that yes, it is bad, that people should always prioritize physical interaction
    to digital one. I disagree. Except for obvious occasions (a work meeting, an actual
    conversation that is taking place between you and someone, etc.), I think people
    should be able to interact with whomever they please without being judged by people
    for using a smartphone to do so.</p><p>It all boils down to letting people connect
    freely using the medium they feel the most comfortable with at the moment. Maybe
    that acquaintance of yours hasn’t gone talk to you because she has had a bad day
    and just wants to relax checking her Instagram feed or listening to some music.
    Maybe your friend has taken his smartphone out of his pocket because he has gotten
    a message that he needs to reply now. Or maybe it’s just that he feels a bit uncomfortable
    and is using his phone to try and avoid the awkwardness of the moment because
    he has social anxiety and you should respect that. And yes, maybe, maybe some
    people are using their smartphones while they objectively shouldn’t without any
    possible excuses and they’re jerks (or they just made a mistake and didn’t realize
    taking their phone out would make someone upset), but I think it’s really unfair
    to assume everyone or nearly everyone who uses a smartphone in public does that.</p><p><img

    more than the other people taking photos or recording. I’m not sure those people
    are really enjoying it less because of their smartphones</em></p><p>Part of the
    commentaries I’ve seen criticizing this whole issue also touch on social media,
    since it is so integrated with our usual smartphone usage. For example, I see
    lots of people complaining about people who take pictures of the food they order
    at restaurants for posting them on Instagram or wherever. I don’t get that. Is
    it wrong to create a permanent memento of an otherwise temporary experience, to
    capture in a photo the work of the people back in the kitchen who made an effort
    to make the food look attractive? To me, those complaints allude to a lack of
    understanding of how modern social media works.</p><p>I think Tumblr user zmizet
    expresses this very accurately in their <a href="http://zmizet.tumblr.com/post/104849285847/poopjokesanonymous-barbieprivilege">comments</a>
    on the Jean Jullien illustrations that I’ve used here. On that exact topic of
    taking photos of food, zmizet expressed the following:</p><blockquote><p>I’m happy
    <strong>seeing my friends take photos of their food</strong>. I like taking photos
    of my food. Because there is a chef in the back of the kitchen who works hard
    to plate things beautifully and in any other situation, people dive in immediately
    and ruin that image. We take photos to preserve that image and who the fuck knows,
    if I was the chef I would be digging through instagram hoping to see my plate
    on there. We’re <strong>celebrating someones hard work</strong>, work that is
    <strong>generally temporary</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>And I agree with that.
    zmizet concludes:</p><blockquote><p>Technology isn’t bad. You’re just upset with
    yourselves for having a lack of self-control. You hate that people connect through
    technology. And maybe, you just don’t like seeing people love themselves, enjoy
    life, and feel joy. That’s your problem, not technology’s.</p></blockquote><p>Social
    media itself is also not bad. It doesn’t make us more socially isolated. Quite
    the contrary, it expands our social network, as shown in <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2009/11/04/social-isolation-and-new-technology/">this
    report</a> by Pew Research Center which concludes:</p><blockquote><p>Compared
    to those who do not use the internet, most people who use the internet and use
    a social networking service, such as Facebook, MySpace, or LinkedIn, have social
    networks that are about 20% more diverse.</p></blockquote><p>It dates back to
    2009, when social media wasn’t as big as it is now, but I firmly believe it still
    stands correct today. I’d also like to point out this key paragraph:</p><blockquote><p>Newer
    information and communication technologies provide new settings and a means of
    communication that independently contribute to the diversity of people’s social
    networks.</p></blockquote><p>Social media, and smartphones for that matter, only
    contributes to make our social experiences richer by connecting us with people
    in new ways. I’m sure many of you have met lots of interesting people. I sure
    have. Thanks to social media, I’ve been able to meet people that are now close
    friends of mine. And when I’m out, I like to open Twitter and check how they are,
    what they are doing, if I have something to say that may interest them. Heck,
    I even met my girlfriend on Twitter years ago. And I’m absolutely certain that
    my experience is not an isolated one, as the research above shows.</p><p><img

    frequent topic appears to be one I’ve already mentioned. People using their smartphones
    on the subway, the bus or the train. This is shown in the illustration used at
    the beginning of this writing or in the comic I referenced above. This is probably
    the one I get the least. What else could people do? What would they do if smartphones
    didn’t exist? Talking to each other? Let’s not fool ourselves. People in general
    do not like to interact with strangers in these contexts. They didn’t when smartphones
    were far from existing; they just used another object instead, like a newspaper.
    In response to the vignette next to this paragraph, Tumblr user bogleech <a href="http://bogleech.tumblr.com/post/68941324116/an-angry-tirade-about-one-comic">commented</a>
    the following:</p><blockquote><p>OH MAN look at those ignorant, pathetic people
    of various ages, sexes and ethnic groups all doing** internet shit** on their
    phones while they ride on a subway! HOLY SHIT THEY’RE ALL DOING IT! EVEN THE GUY
    IN THE <strong>TURBAN</strong> FROM WHATEVER THE HELL VAGUE COUNTRY HE’S SUPPOSED
    TO BE FROM THAT HAS TURBANS!WHY ARE THEY MESSAGING ESTABLISHED FRIENDS AND FAMILY
    ON A PHOENEZ WHEN THEY COULD BE INTERACTING WITH COMPLETE AND UTTER STRANGERS
    ON A GROSS FUCKING SUBWAY CARHOW DARE THEY HAVE PERSONAL OUTLETS AND PRIVATE SPACE
    AND SHIT</p></blockquote><p>The person who wrote that was clearly really passionate
    about this topic. And well, I think that, although violently, they deliver the
    message I’m trying to convey here.</p><p>They also went on to say:</p><blockquote><p>DIGITAL
    TECHNOLOGY OVER JUST THE PAST DECADE HAS CONNECTED AND EDUCATED MORE HUMAN MINDS
    THAN PROBABLY THE ENTIRE SUM OF OUR PLANET’S HISTORYIT’S ALSO A MIRACULOUS FIRST-WORLD
    PRIVILEGE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO MAKE FRIENDS, SHARE YOUR IDEAS, LEARN NEW THINGS,
    HEAL EMOTIONAL WOUNDS THROUGH SOCIAL INTERACTION, FIND ESCAPE FROM ABUSIVE SITUATIONS,
    FIND NEW LIVING SITUATIONS, APPLY FOR JOBS, CREATE YOUR OWN PERSONAL OUTLETS AND
    GENERALLY PURSUE HAPPINESS AT THE TOUCH OF A DAMN BUTTON</p></blockquote><p>You
    don’t have to take their word for it. There are studies that back up all of that
    like <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/530566/the-impact-of-the-internet-on-society-a-global-perspective/">this
    one</a> or <a href="http://www.internetsociety.org/globalinternetreport/assets/download/IS_web.pdf">this

    href="http://www.jeanjullien.com/">Jean Jullien</a>. Is it so bad to have the
    ability to not be alone using our phones?</em></p><p><strong>In conclusion</strong>,
    I think we need to stop thinking technology is ruining everything, making us a
    slave to it, mindlessly using our smartphones all the time. It is not. It is enriching
    our lives, connecting us to the people that matter the most to us regardless of
    how far away they are, connecting us to all kinds of people whom we wouldn’t have
    met otherwise. So, stop feeling superior for making fun of other people because
    they’re using their smartphones, stop pretending our lives and society would be
    better without them, stop blaming technology for natural human behaviors. If you
    see an image like the ones I referenced here, the ones trying to show how we are
    <a href="http://kamikazeruler.tumblr.com/post/104820349487/azurea-by-jean-jullien-visual-representation">“</a>letting
    technology ruin social interactions and pleasant experiences”, stop and reflect
    on <em>why</em> people are actually using their electronic devices. Furthermore,
    stop romanticizing the past, believing life was better without all of this ubiquitous
    technology like in some form of “neo-ludism”. Consumer technology is good. It
    enables us to connect in amazing ways as humans. It is not replacing real interaction.
    It is augmenting it. <strong>Embrace it</strong>.</p><p><em>All of the rights

    alt="Credit: Malte Mueller/Getty"><em>Credit: Malte Mueller/Getty</em></p><p>A
    year ago, I picked <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/7-technologies-to-watch-in-2018-e7e365ebd00">seven
    technologies</a> that would play significant roles in 2018. Some of my predictions
    were correct, and some of them reappear on this list — 5G hasn’t quite happened
    yet, but we’re getting closer.</p><p>As George Saville, the 17th-century English
    statesman and essayist, once wrote, “The best qualification of a prophet is to
    have a good memory.” It’s a fancy way of saying the past is prologue, and no vision
    for the near-future is possible without analyzing past trends. That’s what I’ve
    done to concoct these informed guesses about the state of tech in 2019.</p><p>Of
    course, there are bound to be surprises and off-base prognostications. Don’t sue
    me if things go a bit differently than expected.</p><h2><strong>1. Cryptocurrency</strong></h2><p>Bitcoin
    opened 2018 at almost $17,000 in value and exited at under $4,000. This does not
    mean the end of it or other emerging cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The year 2018 taught
    us that the broad concept behind cryptocurrency — the blockchain — could be useful
    <a href="https://medium.com/s/thenewnew/the-blockchain-could-save-legalized-weed-stop-rolling-your-eyes-53b47125c761">elsewhere</a>.

    and <a href="https://tokenfoundry.com/projects/civil">media</a> to expand in 2019.
    Many will fail as token entrepreneurs struggle to connect offerings to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-bitcoin-bubble-20180629-story.html">real-world
    value</a>. But <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610836/how-secure-is-blockchain-really/">immutable
    ledgers</a> are attractive to an increasingly security-conscious world, and they
    will become the foundation of innumerable new ways of buying, selling, and accounting.</p><h2><strong>2.
    “Screen Time” Services</strong></h2><p>We loved social media, we overused it,
    and now we’re finding that it probably <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/negative-effects-social-media/">isn’t
    that good for us</a>. In addition, whatever trust we once had in the world’s most
    popular social platform, Facebook, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/digital/facebooks-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-year/">all
    but vanished in 2018</a>. Thus, 2019 should bring a reconsideration of our obsession
    with sharing and those dopamine-producing likes and hearts.</p><p>Instead of measuring
    followers, we’ll start comparing <a href="https://medium.com/@LanceUlanoff/apple-ios-12-is-a-toolbox-full-of-iphone-breaks-613630e7c1f">screen
    times</a>. Expect <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/03/01/app-cures-digital-addiction-rewarding-users-avoiding-phone/">more

    Android’s Dashboard, and third-party apps like <a href="https://www.hold.app/">Hold</a>
    are just the tip of the iceberg.</p><h2><strong>3. Cyberwarfare</strong></h2><p>World
    War III is upon us, but instead of boots on the ground, it’s all about binaries
    in the ether.</p><p>After Russia essentially — albeit secretly — declared war
    on the United States by undermining the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/politics/russia-mueller-election.html">2016
    presidential election</a>, it and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/07/31/chinas-hacking-and-influence-goes-unnoticed-while-we-focus-russia-column/860289002/">other
    insurgents</a> have turned their attentions to manipulating hearts, minds, <a
    href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/us/politics/russia-midterm-election-influence-coates.html">elections</a>,
    and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_Brexit_referendum">Brexit</a>.
    The quietest worldwide conflagration will continue this year.</p><p>Educating
    the populace on how they’re being manipulated every single day through technology
    and social media will become a critical priority in 2019. P.W. Singer and Emerson
    T. Brooking’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LikeWar-Weaponization-P-W-Singer/dp/1328695743">*LikeWar</a>*
    should become required reading in high schools and colleges.</p><h2><strong>4.
    Regulation</strong></h2><p>The year 2018 was a low point for privacy, with revelations
    that the most popular social media platform on the planet <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/03/technology/facebook-device-partners-users-friends-data.html">all
    but handed the keys to our personal profiles</a> to a range of partners. Americans,
    following the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/gdpr-an-executive-guide-to-what-you-need-to-know/">General
    Data Protection Regulation</a> in Europe, will demand change.</p><p>In 2019, we’ll
    see movement on the collection of bills from <a href="https://www.meritalk.com/articles/house-members-spar-over-data-privacy-bills-path-forward-remains-murky/">the
    U.S. House and Senate</a> that are aimed at officially regulating the tech industry.
    They could eventually be combined into one overarching Personal Data Privacy Act
    of 2019.</p><p>This kind of policy will have broad, bipartisan support and perhaps
    <a href="https://bakertilly.com/insights/us-federal-data-privacy-law-gains-support-of-tech-giants/">grudging
    support in the tech sector</a>. Assuming the legislation doesn’t overreach, the
    big question will be if the regulation-averse Trump White House will sign. If
    and when that happens, expect GDPR-level changes in how companies like Google,
    Facebook, and Amazon do business. You’ll like some of it — it will be harder for
    companies to use your data without explicit consent, for example — but regulations
    may also slow innovation.</p><h2><strong>5. Electric Self-Driving Cars</strong></h2><p>Most
    states now have some sort of <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/autonomous-vehicles-self-driving-vehicles-enacted-legislation.aspx">self-driving
    automotive legislation</a> on the books, and many new cars have enough built-in
    intelligence to do typical driving tasks. Still, the spread of autonomous driving
    was sporadic at best in 2018. This year could be a huge turning point.</p><p>States
    that have yet to get on board with the technology are being spurred by new <a
    href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/autonomous-vehicles-self-driving-vehicles-enacted-legislation.aspx">federal
    guidelines</a> enacted in September. In addition, Tesla’s Model 3, the <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2018/09/09/tesla-model-3-becomes-1-best-selling-car-in-the-us/">bestselling
    sedan</a> in the United States (by revenue, not total units sold), already has
    some of the most powerful <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/software-v9">autonomous
    driving technology</a> on the road.</p><p>Expect new, all-electric Model 3 competitors
    and tests with self-driving-only lanes on some highways.</p><h2><strong>6. Apple’s
    Mobile Lead Shrinks</strong></h2><p>Every time I run <a href="https://www.geekbench.com/">Geekbench</a>
    on the latest flagship phones from Apple, Samsung, Motorola, LG, and others, the
    iPhone comes out on top. Apple’s custom silicon isn’t just marginally more powerful
    than the Qualcomm CPUs most Android handsets are running — it’s leaps and bounds
    better.</p><p>That may change in 2019, as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-says-10nm-cannon-lake-shipments-still-on-track-as-it-deals-with-14nm-cpu-shortage/">Intel</a>
    and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-855">Qualcomm</a>
    promise new, A.I.-infused mobile CPUs that could level the playing field. Obviously,
    handset performance is not solely defined by numbers in a benchmark. Apple’s A12
    Bionic wins because it outperforms competitors on core tasks like video editing,
    gaming, and augmented reality. How Qualcomm and Intel’s next-gen mobile processors
    handle those tasks will define our mobile computing lives in 2019.</p><h2><strong>7.
    5G</strong></h2><p>5G got off to a slower start than I expected in 2018, but the
    arrival of 5G-ready mobile CPUs and an <a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20181002/carriers/verizon-will-be-extremely-aggressive-with-5g-roll-out">improved
    infrastructure</a> could mean a rapid rollout in 2019 — at least on the Android
    side. Rumors that Apple may wait to support the ultrafast mobile technology <a
    href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/03/apple-to-delay-5g-iphone-support-until-2020/">until
    2020</a> could put a damper on 5G enthusiasm.</p><p>Unfortunately, Apple’s rumored
    decision might be a canny one, as it’s possible that the mismatch between <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/best-5g-phones">5G-ready
    handsets</a> and available infrastructure may persist throughout 2019, pushing
    the Year of 5G into 2020 and beyond. In the meantime, don’t be fooled by <a href="https://mashable.com/article/att-will-add-fake-5g-labels-to-android-phones/#BiUiMA3aMaq7">tricky
    branding</a> from the likes of AT&amp;T.</p><h2><strong>8. Robots</strong></h2><p>Boston
    Dynamics’ “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSjKoEva5bg">parkour bot</a>”
    has me believing that 2019 will be the year of C-3PO — or something like it. Agile,
    humanoid robots with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zarastone/2017/11/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-sophia-the-worlds-first-robot-citizen/#4686ee5746fa">uncanny
    valley–busting, human-like faces</a> will appear in more and more videos and perhaps
    a few pilot programs <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/06/27/pepper-the-robot-hsbc-job/">in
    offices</a> and <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/robots-to-make-robots-at-one-of-the-worlds-most-advanced-facilities/">factories</a>.
    Somewhere in the mix we’ll see next-gen sexbots. They’ll be just as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2018/06/05/in-case-you-are-wondering-sex-with-robots-may-not-be-healthy/#4a886d631f6b">realistic
    and gross</a> as you imagined. It’ll all be a far cry from Will Smith’s <em>I,
    Robot</em>, but it should also be the beginning of a reassociation of the word
    “android” with robots instead of phones.</p><h2><strong>9. Facial Recognition
    and Manipulation</strong></h2><p>Conversations around facial recognition will
    become more urgent in 2019, as the technology becomes more <a href="https://qz.com/1493149/taylor-swift-used-facial-recognition-to-track-her-stalkers-at-a-concert/">widespread</a>
    and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/30/fake-porn-videos-are-being-weaponized-harass-humiliate-women-everybody-is-potential-target/?utm_term=.47f4c7676ad1">open

    Amazon will continue to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-23/amazon-pitches-facial-recognition-tools-to-monitor-immigrants">pitch</a>
    facial recognition to the government; and with the emergence of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ54GDm1eL0">deepfakes</a>,
    all of us will struggle mightily with the idea that imagery can never again be
    trusted.</p><h2><strong>10. AR, Not VR</strong></h2><p>Virtual reality <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/introducing-oculus-quest-our-first-6dof-all-in-one-vr-system-launching-spring-2019/">isn’t
    here to stay</a>. But augmented reality will break out in 2019, as the majority
    of flagship phones already support it.</p><p>Meanwhile, it’ll be a make-or-break

  :title: Apple Is Trying to Kill Web Technology
  :content: '<p>The company has made it extremely difficult to use web-based technology
    on its platforms, and it hopes developers won’t bother</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/10000/1*zqENj8mfvANOuM2PEcFPxw.jpeg"
    alt="Credit: SOPA Images/Getty Images"><em>Credit: SOPA Images/Getty Images</em></p><p>The
    programming languages used to build the web often find their way into apps, too.
    That’s largely due to software that allows developers to “reuse” the code they
    write for the web in products they build to run on operating systems like Linux,
    Android, Windows, and macOS.</p><p>But Apple has a reason not to like this recycling
    of web technology. It wants its Mac App Store to be filled with apps that you
    can’t find anywhere else, not apps that are available on every platform. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/04/electron-app-rejections/">With
    a recent policy change</a>, the company has made it a little more difficult for
    developers to submit apps containing web code.</p><p>The Mac App Store has quietly
    started rejecting apps made with a popular tool called Electron that allows developers
    to base all of their apps on the web-based code. Some of the most popular apps
    in the App Store, like Slack, Spotify, Discord, and WhatsApp, fall into this category.</p><p><a
    href="https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/20027">In a discussion</a> on
    the programming community Github, several developers say rejections for apps that
    they built using Electron — which would were approved in the past — came with
    an explanation that these apps “attempt to hide the use of private APIs,” which
    are APIs built for Apple’s internal usage, rather than for third-party developers.
    Using private APIs to build public-facing apps is commonly frowned upon because
    they may change or break over time, and Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#software-requirements">bans</a>
    apps that use them.</p><p>Electron has used these private APIs for years without
    issue. These private APIs allow developers to, for instance, <a href="https://mozillagfx.wordpress.com/2019/10/22/dramatically-reduced-power-usage-in-firefox-70-on-macos-with-core-animation/">drastically
    improve power usage</a> whereas Apple’s sanctioned tools make the user experience
    worse. In the majority of these cases, Apple doesn’t provide real alternatives
    for developers who want to access these private API features.</p><p>Now it’s unlikely
    that the thousands of developers who have built their apps using Electron can
    release updates to them unless the Electron framework releases a major change
    to its implementation.</p><p>Developers could distribute their apps from their
    own websites, asking users to download them directly. But that means abandoning
    features like Apple’s auto-update mechanism from the Mac App Store and iCloud
    sync. And this direct-to-consumer method could soon be locked down, too, with
    Apple’s controversial <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution">notarization
    requirements</a> potentially requiring their review.</p><p>Apple has a history
    of stunting the web’s progress on its platforms. On iOS, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/184283/why-third-party-browsers-will-always-be-inferior-to-safari-on-iphone-and-ipad/">Apple
    doesn’t allow fully independent third-party browsers</a>, requiring all apps to
    leverage its Safari browser when rendering web-based content. While browsers like
    Chrome and Opera are available in the App Store, they must use Apple’s Safari
    browser behind the scenes to render web pages, rather than their own. That means
    Apple has a monopoly on how iPhone and iPad users access the web. To push developers
    toward building native apps on iOS rather than using web technologies, Apple ignores
    popular parts of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/">open web specification</a>
    that other browsers implement, to its own benefit.</p><blockquote><h1>Apple’s
    subtle, anti-competitive practices don’t look terrible in isolation, but together
    they form a clear strategy.</h1></blockquote><p>A technology called WebRTC, for
    example, allows video calling in a web browser without additional software. It
    powers tools like Google Meet. But Apple was incredibly slow to <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8672/on-the-road-to-webrtc-1-0-including-vp8/">implement
    the specification</a>, leaving out key pieces of functionality, and the technology
    didn’t work <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183201">when embedded
    inside apps</a>.</p><p>Apple also handicapped an emerging standard called Progressive
    Web Apps (PWAs) — which, like Electron, allows developers to build native-like
    apps for both desktop and mobile — by <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=web-app-manifest">partially</a>
    <a href="https://medium.com/@firt/whats-new-on-ios-12-2-for-progressive-web-apps-75c348f8e945">implementing</a>
    it in a way that makes it too inconsistent to rely on. PWA doesn’t have the same
    problem if users open apps in Chrome or Firefox, but iPhone and iPad users can’t
    install third-party browsers, which makes PWA-based technology a non-starter.</p><p>Developers
    use technologies like Electron and PWA because they allow for faster updates across
    platforms without an array of different codebases. Some argue that this results
    in lower quality apps, but I’d argue the alternative is no app at all or apps
    that are rarely updated because maintaining unique Windows, Mac, and web-based
    products is complex and expensive. Apple recently launched a <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/to-revive-the-mac-apple-wants-to-kill-electron-154873336e78">competing
    framework called Catalyst</a>, which allows developers with iPad apps to bring
    them to macOS quickly — a great tool for developers exclusively targeting Apple
    users, but not those building cross-platform apps.</p><p>Apple’s subtle, anti-competitive
    practices don’t look terrible in isolation, but together they form a clear strategy:
    Make it so painful to build with web-based technology on Apple platforms that
    developers won’t bother. Now that the App Store is not accepting apps built using
    Electron, developers will likely find creative ways to work around it, but Apple
    is setting up for a continual cat-and-mouse game as it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/03/apple-macos-catalina-notarization-mac-apps/">plans
    to exert more control</a> over which apps can run on the platform in the future.</p><p>These
    types of changes may be made in the name of privacy or security, but the reality
    is that the argument looks weak when both users and developers simply don’t have
    a choice because Apple controls the platform, browser engine, and the distribution
    method. Regardless of your opinion of Electron app quality, choice is important.</p><p>Apple’s
    control over its app ecosystem is a new type of monopoly that’s hard to understand
    for lawmakers, and difficult for us to fight back against — because there simply
    isn’t a way out of these restrictions when the company controls both the distribution
    method and the platform itself.</p>'

  :title: Technology and The Evolution of Storytelling
  :content: '<p>by John Lasseter<em>John Lasseter at the 68th Academy Awards in 1996
    accepting a Special Achievement award for his leadership of Pixar’s “Toy Story”
    team, resulting in the first feature-length computer-animated film.</em></p><p>It
    is such an exciting time to be a filmmaker.</p><p>I do not believe the notion
    that the cinema is dying or dead because it’s amazing what technology can do to
    the cinematic storytelling.</p><p>What’s great about film is it constantly reinvents
    itself. It started as a sheer novelty, those images moving on the screen.</p><p>Then
    it went and every step of the way a new technology started being added — sound,
    color.</p><p>What happens is the film grammar of storytelling evolves and changes
    as well. The technology goes directly with the evolution of the storytelling.</p><p>The
    way films look —it started with old 35mm motion picture cameras, to color with
    the three-strip Technicolor, to cameras that weighed hundreds of pounds and had
    to be on dollies and cranes — that was the film grammar of the day.</p><blockquote><h1>The
    limitations of the technology being used to shoot the films set up what we’ve
    learned as film grammar.</h1></blockquote><p>Then, we came to lighter cameras,
    to handheld cameras, steady cams, and on and on, all the way down to now.</p><p>There’s
    a unique thing to a GoPro.</p><p>There’s a unique thing to an iPhone — the way
    things are shot and the way it’s held. It just gives it a vibrancy you’ve never
    been able to have before.</p><p>I believe new film grammar is going to come from
    these things.</p><p>It evolves, it changes, and it’s in great part because of
    the technology.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4000/1*AnxiGh1JlUSqEqV-OJ0J1Q.jpeg"

    1939 receiving one Oscar statuette and seven miniature statuettes from Shirley
    Temple for “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”</em></p><p>In my own field, in animation,
    a seminal film in the history of animation is <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em>,
    Walt Disney’s first feature-length film.</p><p>People thought Walt was insane.</p><p>“People
    aren’t going to sit still for a feature-length cartoon. Are you nuts?”</p><p>But
    Walt was a visionary.</p><p>Walt saw beyond what people were used to. They were
    used to the short cartoon.</p><blockquote><h1>It’s interesting how people cannot
    see beyond what they’re used to.</h1></blockquote><p>There’s a famous statement
    by Henry Ford that before the Model T if you asked people what they wanted, they
    would say, “A faster horse.”</p><p>My own partner at Pixar for 25 years, Steve
    Jobs, never liked market research. Never did market research for anything.</p><p>He
    said, “It’s not the audience’s job to tell us what they want in the future, it’s
    for us to tell them what they want in the future.”</p><blockquote><h1>If you use
    technology correctly, you can change opinions overnight.</h1></blockquote><p>There’s
    a great statement I love. It’s that you only get one chance to make a first impression.</p><p>First
    impressions are nearly impossible to get people off of if they have the wrong
    impression.</p><p>I remember when I first saw computer animation. It wasn’t being
    used for much at the time. It was really geometric, sterile and cold, but I was
    blown away by it. Not by what I was seeing, but the potential I saw in it.</p><p>It
    was true three dimensionality with a control that we had in hand-drawn animation.
    I saw the potential in computer animation and was like, “This is great. Everybody,
    can you see this?”</p><p>But everybody was saying, “It looks like… It’s too sterile.
    No, I don’t like it.”</p><p>I realized they were judging from exactly what they
    were seeing.</p><p>People always push back saying, “It’s too cold, too sterile.”</p><p>In
    the early days of computer graphics, it found its way into special effects.</p><p>There
    were some people who didn’t understand the medium and thought it could do everything.
    There was this company that tried when they were making a movie called <em>Something
    Wicked This Way Comes</em>.</p><p>They had worked on <em>Tron</em>, did some effects,
    and they had a very charismatic effects guy that convinced them they could create
    this magical circus that would erect itself — this evil circus comes to town.</p><p>Disney
    bought in on it and they worked for a very long time. I had a very dear friend
    working on it.</p><p>It was way beyond what the computer could do at that time.
    They ended up cutting the entire sequence out of the film.</p><p>That set back
    computer graphics in the effects world years, because everybody remembered that
    experience.</p><blockquote><h1>It was because people didn’t understand what the
    technology <em>could</em> do.</h1></blockquote><p>About six years after that I
    was working at Lucas Film’s computer division and Dennis Muren, the brilliant
    Dennis Muren, Effects Director at ILM, came over to me and said, “We have this
    effect in a film called <em>Young Sherlock Holmes</em>, and we don’t know how
    to do it. I’m thinking computer graphics.”</p><p>It was only six shots. We said,
    “Let’s try it.”</p><p>It was some of the hardest things we ever did, but I’ll
    never forget when it came out — the effects industry, people from all over the
    world, had no idea how it was done.</p><p>But it worked. It fit in there. It was
    nominated for an Oscar for best visual effects.</p><p>We were so excited. But
    it was focusing on understanding the technology and pushing it to places that
    we couldn’t.</p><blockquote><h1>The goal was to make the technology invisible.</h1></blockquote><p>When
    we became Pixar in 1986 and we started working towards our first feature film,
    I remembered all those projects. I was blessed by, number one, loving the medium
    of computer animation.</p><p>I was just so interested in it and working with the
    people who basically had invented much of computer animation and we were pushing
    it all along.</p><p>We really understood what the computer could and could not
    do.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*kVJDRemXeuOQlH6DDVYa_w.jpeg"
    alt="Pixar co-founders Ed Catmull, Steve Jobs, and John Lasseter."><em>Pixar co-founders
    Ed Catmull, Steve Jobs, and John Lasseter.</em></p><p>At that time when we rendered
    things, everything kind of looked plastic-y.</p><p>So we started thinking about
    a subject matter that lent itself to the medium at that time.</p><blockquote><h1>“Everything
    looks like plastic, so what if the characters were made of plastic? What if they
    were…toys?”</h1></blockquote><p>That’s one of the reasons why we leaned into toys
    becoming alive as a subject for our very first feature film, <em>Toy Story</em>.</p><p>It
    was about the toys that lent themselves to the medium at that time. We chose toys
    that worked for that.</p><p>In fact, it was better in CG than any other medium
    we could have done because we could make Buzz Lightyear feel like he was made
    of plastic and ball-and-socket joints and we had screws and scratches and decals
    and all this stuff you could not have done in any other medium.</p><p>When it
    came out, our main focus was not the technology.</p><p>What I was scared about
    was that people would be like, “Oh, it’s the first computer-animated feature film.”</p><p>We
    made sure Disney, and all around the world, didn’t sell it as “The First CG film.”</p><p>You
    sell it as a great motion picture, because that’s how we made it.</p><blockquote><h1>We
    focused on the story and hiding the technology.</h1></blockquote><p>It came out
    and people loved it. You watch it today and it’s just as entertaining as the day
    it came out.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*kiIqKInYaxbllWwnhwJqSQ.jpeg"
    alt="Woody and Buzz in the original “Toy Story”"><em>Woody and Buzz in the original
    “Toy Story”</em></p><p>Like I said, you’ve only got one chance to make a first
    impression.</p><p>Unlike <em>Something Wicked This Way Comes, Toy Story</em> was
    the number one film of the year it came out.</p><p>It was a huge hit and everybody
    started looking at this as a viable filmmaking medium.</p><blockquote><h1>Overnight,
    the opinion changed. Because the technology was used in the right way, telling
    the right story.</h1></blockquote><p>Alfred Hitchcock is one of my favorite filmmakers
    and one of the reasons why I’ve studied and admired his films is that guy used
    new technology in incredible ways, but it was completely invisible in everything
    he made.</p><p>You study his films and realize there’s no way he could have made
    that film, that shot, without that technology.</p><p>But he didn’t want you to
    notice it.</p><p>We focus on entertaining people in new ways, and if you focus
    on the technology too much you get caught up.</p><blockquote><h1>It’s not the
    technology that entertains people, it’s what you do with the technology.</h1></blockquote><p>It’s
    important, I believe, to make the technology invisible, but have it push to do
    something new.</p><p>That’s when you make real breakthroughs.</p><p>If you love
    a technology, if you really, really, really, really love a technology, then dig
    into it.</p><p>Learn as much as you can. It’s fun. That’s what I did with CG.</p><p><img

    was trained by these great Disney artists. I drew. It was all about story, character
    drawing, all that stuff, but when I got into computer graphics I was like, “Oh,
    my god, this is so much fun.”</p><p>I wanted to learn as much as I could.</p><p>The
    more you dig into the technology and the more you learn it, you are going to get
    ideas you would never have thought of without knowing your technology.</p><p>The
    kind of shots you can get from an iPhone that you cannot get with any other camera.
    Use it.</p><p>GoPros: use it. Be inspired by it.</p><p>Try things. It’s digital.
    Get another memory card, for God’s sake.</p><p>You will start creating ideas that
    lend themselves to these things and start looking new.</p><blockquote><h1>When
    you start doing something that’s truly new you will hear, “It’s not going to work.”</h1></blockquote><p>Walt
    Disney heard it. I heard it with CG.</p><p>“ Computer animation is so cold.”</p><p>Really?
    No, I don’t think so.</p><p>You think about it, it’s true for color, sound, feature
    length animation, CG.</p><p>The first feature film shot on an iPhone? “That’s
    not going to work.”</p><p>Yeah, it’s going to work. It’s going to be awesome.</p><p>The
    first feature shot with a GoPro? It’s going to be awesome in the hands of the
    right people.</p><p>The reason why they say this is because it’s not what people
    are used to.</p><p>Before the Model T, you ask people what they want and they’re
    going to want a faster horse. It’s not what they’re used to.</p><p>When I started
    working with CG, I could not wait for the tools to become commonplace.</p><p>In
    the early days, when SIGGRAPH was the only place you could go and see computer
    graphics, it was always fun. Everybody would cheer for reflective clear balls
    floating over a checkerboard and be amazed by it.</p><p>It was in a world where
    all of the art and the CG was being created by the guys who were writing the program.</p><p>There
    was no such thing as off-the-shelf software. There were no tools available.</p><p>They
    were writing their software and then creating it, and they were kind of the artistic
    guys within the computer world.</p><p>They were just showing off the technology.
    I kept thinking to myself, “Yeah, but they’re really ugly. This is like boring.
    Let’s entertain people.”</p><blockquote><h1>I couldn’t wait because I always viewed
    the technology as simply a tool.</h1></blockquote><p>Can you imagine the guy who
    invented the pencil and all of the things that that invention has brought the
    world?</p><p>That’s what I was feeling like with CG.</p><p>I couldn’t wait to
    get it in the hands of everybody to see what they would do.</p><blockquote><h1>The
    mediums we use are simply tools for expressing your art.</h1></blockquote><p>Your
    goal as a filmmaker is to entertain. And to entertain people is about story.</p><p>It’s
    about characters.</p><p>It’s about connecting with that audience.</p><p>It’s making
    that connection where you really deeply entertain an audience.</p><p>But it’s
    not just an art form that we’re in. It’s a business. Entertaining stuff simply
    just does better.</p><blockquote><h1>If you can make people laugh, cry and feel
    things with a film you make, you will be successful.</h1></blockquote><p>No matter
    what medium, any way you’ve distributed it — it all comes down to your knowledge
    skills.</p><p>What makes a good story? How can I tell it properly?</p><p>People
    get so excited about new technologies. I’ve had the question so many times from
    young people, “What software should I use?”</p><blockquote><h1>You know what?
    In your lifetime the software and the technology will change so drastically, it
    doesn’t matter.</h1></blockquote><p>What matters is when you’re young, you get
    excited about learning the fundamentals.</p><p>It sounds so boring to young people
    when they can make a movie so quickly and release it to the world and get millions
    of Likes.</p><p>“It’s so boring. I know how to do that.”</p><p>Trust me, you don’t.</p><p>The
    fundamentals of good storytelling, the fundamentals of film grammar, even though
    it was made with old Mitchell cameras and stuff like that, learn it.</p><p>Learn
    the fundamentals of animation. Learn the fundamentals of physics and things like
    that, of basic color, basic design.</p><p>This is the foundation of the building
    of your career.</p><p>Then, as you get into new technology, you’ll know exactly
    what to do.</p><blockquote><h1>And your work will not be about the technology.
    It will be about connecting and entertaining people.</h1></blockquote><p>No matter
    the length of your film — 30 seconds, five minutes, 22 minutes, feature length
    — it needs a story. It needs a beginning, a middle and an end.</p><p>It needs
    to deeply connect with people.</p><p>There are big differences between storytelling
    at 30 seconds or a feature film. Big differences.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*50BOA2AeBYI4JOHwbZpfWw.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>We did a series of short films in the beginning of Pixar and we
    did television commercials.</p><p>We were thinking the next step for us was to
    do a Christmas special, but Disney threw us in the deep end, and we developed
    a feature film.</p><p>It was amazing what we didn’t know.</p><p>But I went back
    to my traditional training I had learned from my mentors — Frank Thomas, Ollie
    Johnston, and the great Disney animators that were still working at the studio
    when I started there — and the fundamentals of animation they kept talking about.</p><p>Ollie
    Johnston would turn to me and I was expecting something about arcs and lines and
    silhouette value and all that stuff.</p><p>He would turn and say, “John, what’s
    the character thinking?”</p><p>It was amazing to me, just that simple statement.
    It was not about the drawing.</p><blockquote><h1>It was never about the drawing
    to them. It was about that character and what it’s thinking.</h1></blockquote><p>Through
    pure movement they taught me to bring a character to life and give it an emotion,
    a personality, a uniqueness, and it was done through just pure motion.</p><p>So
    when I started working with a computer, I just brought that technology with me.
    As we started developing the story, it was always about emotion. It was always
    about emotion from day one with <em>Toy Story</em>.</p><p>It was about emotion,
    making you feel.</p><p>I’ve admired Walt Disney so much my whole life and part
    of it is because he entertained people like no other person in history has ever
    done. The way he makes you feel when you watch his movies, the way he makes you
    feel when go through that tunnel under the train station at Disneyland and you’re
    transported.</p><p>It’s about emotion and that connection.</p><blockquote><h1>Walt
    always said, “For every laugh, there should be a tear.”</h1></blockquote><p>It
    felt like that core emotion. That became the hallmark of what we tried to do at
    Pixar — to do it with the new technology.</p><p>I think the biggest thing for
    us is we studied films. We watched films religiously.</p><p>With <em>Toy Story,</em>
    it was a buddy picture. We watched every buddy picture we could find and analyzed
    it. Good ones, and it’s very important to watch bad ones too.</p><p>You start
    understanding what they did. Don’t copy things. It’s about understanding and learning.</p><p>Very,
    very, very important: Do not work in a vacuum.</p><p>You have to surround yourself
    with trusted people. You get so immersed in your work, you will not be able to
    see the forest from the trees. Frankly, you’ll be studying the pine needles and
    worrying about them.</p><p>You need someone to help you back up and take a look
    at the forest and see where things are working or not working.</p><p>And you need
    to surround yourself with people whose judgment you trust and they can be brutally
    honest with you.</p><p>As an artist, showing unfinished work to people is really
    difficult. It’s really hard. It always is hard. It always will be hard. It never
    gets any easier, but you have to do it.</p><blockquote><h1>Andrew Stanton, my
    creative partner at Pixar, has this fantastic phrase that I use all the time,
    “Be wrong as fast as you can.”</h1></blockquote><p>Trust me, when you go from
    an outline to a treatment, your first treatment sucks and you do revisions and
    talk to people and you get something working really great.</p><p>Go to your first
    draft of the script, it sucks. You do it a whole bunch of times.</p><p>For us,
    we go to story reels, the first story reel sucks. But the longer you say, “I’m
    not ready yet, give me a little more time, give me a little more time,” and like
    that, it’s not going to help the problem.</p><p>You’re just going to be polishing.
    You’re not going to see where it’s not working.</p><p>Get it up there. Throw it
    up there as fast as you can, talk about it, tear it back down, put it back up
    there. Keep doing this.</p><p>Surround yourself with people you trust.</p><p>Be
    thirsty for knowledge.</p><p>It will always make your work better. The market
    is changing really, really quickly.</p><p>Who knows what the business will look
    like ten years from now?</p><p>I know one thing for sure.</p><blockquote><h1>If

  :title: Full Cycle Developers at Netflix
  :content: '<p>The year was 2012 and operating a critical service at Netflix was
    laborious. Deployments felt like walking through wet sand. Canarying was devolving
    into verifying endurance (“nothing broke after one week of canarying, let’s push
    it”) rather than correct functionality. Researching issues felt like bouncing
    a rubber ball between teams, hard to catch the root cause and harder yet to stop
    from bouncing between one another. All of these were signs that changes were needed.</p><p>Fast
    forward to 2018. Netflix has grown to 125M global members enjoying 140M+ hours
    of viewing per day. We’ve invested significantly in improving the development
    and operations story for our engineering teams. Along the way we’ve experimented
    with many approaches to building and operating our services. We’d like to share
    one approach, including its pros and cons, that is relatively common within Netflix.
    We hope that sharing our experiences inspires others to debate the alternatives
    and learn from our journey.</p><h2>One Team’s Journey</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_ygR9i9EbM">Edge</a>
    <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/tagged/edge-engineering">Engineering</a>
    is responsible for the first layer of AWS services that must be up for Netflix
    streaming to work. In the past, Edge Engineering had ops-focused teams and SRE
    specialists who owned the deploy+operate+support parts of the software life cycle.
    Releasing a new feature meant devs coordinating with the ops team on things like
    metrics, alerts, and capacity considerations, and then handing off code for the
    ops team to deploy and operate. To be effective at running the code and supporting
    partners, the ops teams needed ongoing training on new features and bug fixes.
    The primary upside of having a separate ops team was less developer interrupts
    when things were going well.</p><p>When things didn’t go well, the costs added
    up. Communication and knowledge transfers between devs and ops/SREs were lossy,
    requiring additional round trips to debug problems or answer partner questions.
    Deployment problems had a higher time-to-detect and time-to-resolve due to the
    ops teams having less direct knowledge of the changes being deployed. The gap
    between code complete and deployed was much longer than today, with releases happening
    on the order of weeks rather than days. Feedback went from ops, who directly experienced
    pains such as lack of alerting/monitoring or performance issues and increased
    latencies, to devs, who were hearing about those problems second-hand.</p><p>To
    improve on this, Edge Engineering experimented with a hybrid model where devs
    could push code themselves when needed, and also were responsible for off-hours
    production issues and support requests. This improved the feedback and learning
    cycles for developers. But, having only partial responsibility left gaps. For
    example, even though devs could do their own deployments and debug pipeline breakages,
    they would often defer to the ops release specialist. For the ops-focused people,
    they were motivated to do the day to day work but found it hard to prioritize
    automation so that others didn’t need to rely on them.</p><p>In search of a better
    way, we took a step back and decided to start from first principles. What were
    we trying to accomplish and why weren’t we being successful?</p><h2>The Software
    Life Cycle</h2><p>The purpose of the software life cycle is to optimize “time
    to value”; to effectively convert ideas into working products and services for
    customers. Developing and running a software service involves a full set of responsibilities:</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*JnixtUHJjNYXNT15P42eJQ.png" alt="SDLC
    components"><em>SDLC components</em></p><p>We had been segmenting these responsibilities.
    At an extreme, this means each functional area is owned by a different person/role:</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*RDxX_aeUAZkLDctKY0g_Zw.png" alt="SDLC
    specialists"><em>SDLC specialists</em></p><p>These specialized roles create efficiencies
    within each segment while potentially creating inefficiencies across the entire
    life cycle. Specialists develop expertise in a focused area and optimize what’s
    needed for that area. They get more effective at solving their piece of the puzzle.
    But software requires the entire life cycle to deliver value to customers. Having
    teams of specialists who each own a slice of the life cycle can create silos that
    slow down end-to-end progress. Grouping differing specialists together into one
    team can reduce silos, but having different people do each role adds communication
    overhead, introduces bottlenecks, and inhibits the effectiveness of feedback loops.</p><h2>Operating
    What You Build</h2><p>To rethink our approach, we drew inspiration from the <a
    href="http://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/">principles
    of the devops movement</a>. We could optimize for learning and feedback by breaking
    down silos and encouraging shared ownership of the full software life cycle:</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*s-lG4Jt9tSAY0D3j_NgjWg.png" alt="SDLC
    with devops principles"><em>SDLC with devops principles</em></p><p>“Operate what
    you build” puts the devops principles in action by having the team that develops
    a system also be responsible for operating and supporting that system. Distributing
    this responsibility to each development team, rather than externalizing it, creates
    direct feedback loops and aligns incentives. Teams that feel operational pain
    are empowered to remediate the pain by changing their system design or code; they
    are responsible and accountable for both functions. Each development team owns
    deployment issues, performance bugs, capacity planning, alerting gaps, partner
    support, and so on.</p><h3>Scaling Through Developer Tools</h3><p>Ownership of
    the full development life cycle adds significantly to what software developers
    are expected to do. Tooling that simplifies and automates common development needs
    helps to balance this out. For example, if software developers are expected to
    manage rollbacks of their services, rich tooling is needed that can both detect
    and alert them of the problems as well as to aid in the rollback.</p><p>Netflix
    created centralized teams (e.g., Cloud Platform, Performance &amp; Reliability
    Engineering, Engineering Tools) with the mission of developing <a href="https://netflix.github.io/">common
    tooling and infrastructure</a> to solve problems that every development team has.
    Those centralized teams act as force multipliers by turning their specialized
    knowledge into reusable building blocks. For example:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ofq0GgytcKR-gwnToS3crw.png"
    alt="Specialists create reusable tools"><em>Specialists create reusable tools</em></p><p>Empowered
    with these tools in hand, development teams can focus on solving problems within
    their specific product domain. As additional tooling needs arise, centralized
    teams assess whether the needs are common across multiple dev teams. When they
    are, collaborations ensue. Sometimes these local needs are too specific to warrant
    centralized investment. In that case the development team decides if their need
    is important enough for them to solve on their own.</p><p>Balancing local versus
    central investment in similar problems is one of the toughest aspects of our approach.
    In our experience the benefits of finding novel solutions to developer needs are
    worth the risk of multiple groups creating parallel solutions that will need to
    converge down the road. Communication and alignment are the keys to success. By
    starting well-aligned on the needs and how common they are likely to be, we can
    better match the investment to the benefits to dev teams across Netflix.</p><h3>Full
    Cycle Developers</h3><p>By combining all of these ideas together, we arrived at
    a model where a development team, equipped with amazing developer productivity
    tools, is responsible for the full software life cycle: design, development, test,
    deploy, operate, and support.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*_nN4aj7uohV4v8bnqJCw3g.png"
    alt="The empowered full cycle developer"><em>The empowered full cycle developer</em></p><p>Full
    cycle developers are expected to be knowledgeable and effective in all areas of
    the software life cycle. For many new-to-Netflix developers, this means ramping
    up on areas they haven’t focused on before. We run dev bootcamps and other forms
    of ongoing training to impart this knowledge and build up these skills. Knowledge
    is necessary but not sufficient; easy-to-use tools for deployment pipelines (e.g.,
    <a href="https://www.spinnaker.io/">Spinnaker</a>) and monitoring (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/atlas/wiki">Atlas</a>)
    are also needed for effective full cycle ownership.</p><p>Full cycle developers
    apply engineering discipline to all areas of the life cycle. They evaluate problems
    from a developer perspective and ask questions like “how can I automate what is
    needed to operate this system?” and “what self-service tool will enable my partners
    to answer their questions without needing me to be involved?” This helps our teams
    scale by favoring systems-focused rather than humans-focused thinking and automation
    over manual approaches.</p><p>Moving to a full cycle developer model requires
    a mindset shift. Some developers view design+development, and sometimes testing,
    as the primary way that they create value. This leads to the anti-pattern of viewing
    operations as a distraction, favoring short term fixes to operational and support
    issues so that they can get back to their “real job”. But the “real job” of full
    cycle developers is to use their software development expertise to solve problems
    across the full life cycle. A full cycle developer thinks and acts like an SWE,
    SDET, and SRE. At times they create software that solves business problems, at
    other times they write test cases for that, and still other times they automate
    operational aspects of that system.</p><p>For this model to succeed, teams must
    be committed to the value it brings and be cognizant of the costs. Teams need
    to be staffed appropriately with enough headroom to manage builds and deployments,
    handle production issues, and respond to partner support requests. Time needs
    to be devoted to training. Tools need to be leveraged and invested in. Partnerships
    need to be fostered with centralized teams to create reusable components and solutions.
    All areas of the life cycle need to be considered during planning and retrospectives.
    Investments like automating alert responses and building self-service partner
    support tools need to be prioritized alongside business projects. With appropriate
    staffing, prioritization, and partnerships, teams can be successful at operating
    what they build. Without these, teams risk overload and burnout.</p><p>To apply
    this model outside of Netflix, adaptations are necessary. The common problems
    across your dev teams are likely similar — from the need for continuous delivery
    pipelines, monitoring/observability, and so on. But many companies won’t have
    the staffing to invest in centralized teams like at Netflix, nor will they need
    the complexity that Netflix’s scale requires. Netflix’s tools are often open source,
    and it may be compelling to try them as a first pass. However, other open source
    and SaaS solutions to these problems can meet most companies needs. Start with
    analysis of the potential value and count the costs, followed by the mindset-shift.
    Evaluate what you need and be mindful of bringing in the least complexity necessary.</p><h3>Trade-offs</h3><p>The
    tech industry has a wide range of ways to solve development and operations needs
    (see <a href="http://web.devopstopologies.com/">devops topologies</a> for an extensive
    list). The full cycle model described here is common at Netflix, but has its downsides.
    Knowing the trade-offs before choosing a model can increase the chance of success.</p><p>With
    the full cycle model, priority is given to a larger area of ownership and effectiveness
    in those broader domains through tools. Breadth requires both interest and aptitude
    in a diverse range of technologies. Some developers prefer focusing on becoming
    world class experts in a narrow field and our industry needs those types of specialists
    for some areas. For those experts, the need to be broad, with reasonable depth
    in each area, may be uncomfortable and sometimes unfulfilling. Some at Netflix
    prefer to be in an area that needs deep expertise without requiring ongoing breadth
    and we support them in finding those roles; others enjoy and welcome the broader
    responsibilities.</p><p>In our experience with building and operating cloud-based
    systems, we’ve seen effectiveness with developers who value the breadth that owning
    the full cycle requires. But that breadth increases each developer’s cognitive
    load and means a team will balance more priorities every week than if they just
    focused on one area. We mitigate this by having an on-call rotation where developers
    take turns handling the deployment + operations + support responsibilities. When
    done well, that creates space for the others to do the focused, flow-state type
    work. When not done well, teams devolve into everyone jumping in on high-interrupt
    work like production issues, which can lead to burnout.</p><p>Tooling and automation
    help to scale expertise, but no tool will solve every problem in the developer
    productivity and operations space. Netflix has a “paved road” set of tools and
    practices that are formally supported by centralized teams. We don’t mandate adoption
    of those paved roads but encourage adoption by ensuring that development and operations
    using those technologies is a far better experience than not using them. The downside
    of our approach is that the ideal of “every team using every feature in every
    tool for their most important needs” is near impossible to achieve. Realizing
    the returns on investment for our centralized teams’ solutions requires effort,
    alignment, and ongoing adaptations.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The path from 2012
    to today has been full of experiments, learning, and adaptations. Edge Engineering,
    whose earlier experiences motivated finding a better model, is actively applying
    the full cycle developer model today. Deployments are routine and frequent, canaries
    take hours instead of days, and developers can quickly research issues and make
    changes rather than bouncing the responsibilities across teams. Other groups are
    seeing similar benefits. However, we’re cognizant that we got here by applying
    and learning from alternate approaches. We expect tomorrow’s needs to motivate
    further evolution.</p><p>Interested in seeing this model in action? Want to be

  :title: An open letter from technology sector leaders on Donald Trump’s candidacy
    for President
  :content: "<p>We are inventors, entrepreneurs, engineers, investors, researchers,
    and business leaders working in the technology sector. We are proud that American
    innovation is the envy of the world, a source of widely-shared prosperity, and
    a hallmark of our global leadership.</p><p>We believe in an inclusive country
    that fosters opportunity, creativity and a level playing field. Donald Trump does
    not. He campaigns on anger, bigotry, fear of new ideas and new people, and a fundamental
    belief that America is weak and in decline. We have listened to Donald Trump over
    the past year and we have concluded: Trump would be a disaster for innovation.
    His vision stands against the open exchange of ideas, free movement of people,
    and productive engagement with the outside world that is critical to our economy
    — and that provide the foundation for innovation and growth.</p><p>Let’s start
    with the human talent that drives innovation forward. We believe that America’s
    diversity is our strength. Great ideas come from all parts of society, and we
    should champion that broad-based creative potential. We also believe that progressive
    immigration policies help us attract and retain some of the brightest minds on
    earth — scientists, entrepreneurs, and creators. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 companies
    were founded by immigrants or their children. Donald Trump, meanwhile, traffics
    in ethnic and racial stereotypes, repeatedly insults women, and is openly hostile
    to immigration. He has promised a wall, mass deportations, and profiling.</p><p>We
    also believe in the free and open exchange of ideas, including over the Internet,
    as a seed from which innovation springs. Donald Trump proposes “shutting down”
    parts of the Internet as a security strategy — demonstrating both poor judgment
    and ignorance about how technology works. His penchant to censor extends to revoking
    press credentials and threatening to punish media platforms that criticize him.</p><p>Finally,
    we believe that government plays an important role in the technology economy by
    investing in infrastructure, education and scientific research. Donald Trump articulates
    few policies beyond erratic and contradictory pronouncements. His reckless disregard
    for our legal and political institutions threatens to upend what attracts companies
    to start and scale in America. He risks distorting markets, reducing exports,
    and slowing job creation.</p><p>We stand against Donald Trump’s divisive candidacy
    and want a candidate who embraces the ideals that built America’s technology industry:
    freedom of expression, openness to newcomers, equality of opportunity , public
    investments in research and infrastructure, and respect for the rule of law. We
    embrace an optimistic vision for a more inclusive country, where American innovation
    continues to fuel opportunity, prosperity and leadership.</p><p>*<strong><em>DISCLAIMER:

  :title: The opportunity to change lives using blockchain technology.
  :content: <p>At INVESTA our vision is of a future where Blockchain technology will
    provide Advancement and well being through technology.</p><p>Amongst many uses
    companies and entrepreneurs alike give to Blockchain Technology, one that we at
    INVESTA are committed to bring to fruition is the expensive remittance services
    in the Latin American Region.</p><p>This affects a special part of the population
    comprised of migrants spread around the American continent. The remittances sent
    on 2015 rose to the highest level in at least 15 years. This brought a total amount
    of $68.3 billion that migrants transferred higher than a pre-recession peak of
    $64.5 billion in 2008.</p><p><em>“Family remittances to 17 Latin American Countries
    grew over 8% from 2016 to 2017, reaching Over $75Billion. This increase far exceeds
    the World’s Bank forecasted 1.2% economic growth for the entire region. In terms
    of Scale, remittance growth has been nearly as large as export growth 9% in 2017”</em>
    (Manuel Orozco-2017 -The Dialogue Leadership for the Americas).</p><p>Using the
    potential sanctions and higher risk associated with abusing the banking system
    for money laundering major international banks continue to pose a major challenge
    to the provision of remittance services. Complaining that remittance transactions
    are prone to the risk of money laundering and other financial crimes, banks have
    been closing the correspondent banking accounts of many money-transfer operators
    (MTOs). Remittance service providers and banks need not only to apply “know-your-customer”
    (KYC) regulations, they also need to know their customer’s customer. According
    to the World Bank’s survey on this phenomenon in the G20 countries, MTO account
    closures by banks was widespread. This situation has continued this year, in which
    banks are closing the bank accounts of MTOs. A risk-based approach is what the
    Guidance on financial inclusion of the Financial Access Task Force (FATF) recommends
    when dealing with AML/CFT systems. Nevertheless, several financial institutions
    do not want to take any risk and prefer to close the accounts of money transfer
    operators (MTOs).</p><p>To add to this issue, a great amount of remittance users
    are, in the most part, either unbanked or underbanked with little to no banking
    services provided to them due to their legal situation in their respective countries.
    this forces people to incur in additional expenses in the form of fees that certain
    MTOs offer which are in many cases higher than a regular international bank to
    bank wire transfer.</p><p>As a simple example a Venezuelan migrant in Chile, that
    had to flee his country looking for better opportunities. Has absolutely no banking
    services available to him for the first year until he can successfully apply for
    a visa, and even then the banking services he can obtain are quite limited for
    the next 5 years until he can get full residency. During that time this Venezuelan
    worker would have only the alternative to use one of the many MTOs. Which for
    their service will charge a fee that ranges from 5% all the way to 18% if we factor
    the spread difference of the exchange rate.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*t3L8T9tj4zdnLmSptJOV4g.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The establishment of Blockchain digital payment systems for remittances
    instead of using regular cash MTOs for these types of transactions are of enormous
    benefit to the poor in developing countries. Through its ITM Network in conjunction
    with its proprietary REALM Platform INVESTA is setting a network across the region
    and some European countries which provide transparency, safety and reliability
    safeguards. interoperability of bank and nonbank financial service providers so
    different types of systems work with each other, adequate physical infrastructure
    to offer digital payments, availability of cash-out points, stability of prices,
    and sequencing in the adoption of digital payments and mobile money.</p><p>Several
    attempts to solve most of the issues have been approached by different companies
    from many sectors of the industry. Most of them with innovative solutions, others
    in conjunction with banking related products. But what INVESTA proposes is to
    solve this issue taking what already works and making it better, faster, easier
    and above all safer. All with the use of our Inter Numerical Valuechain. (INV)
    as the vehicle for transparency, security and efficiency.</p><blockquote><h1>At

  :title: Why Technology’s Early Adopters Are Opting Out
  :content: '<p>When the box arrived, I was excited. I felt like I was stepping into
    the future. Once I got it all wired up and began the setup, though, my original
    hesitation came flooding back.</p><p><em>Nest would like to use your location.</em></p><p>I
    almost bailed. This is when Nest stopped feeling like a fun, helpful device and
    started to feel like an intrusive portal. Yet another keyhole for a company (or
    whomever else) to peer into my family’s life. It was probably okay, I rationalized.
    It’s probably just sharing location and temperature data, I thought to myself.</p><p>I
    wouldn’t have had this conversation with myself a decade ago. As the internet
    grew and the iPhone came on the scene, it was exciting. I felt a reverence, almost
    gratitude for everything it enabled. Driven by curiosity and optimism, I signed
    up for any new service just to see what the future might hold. I was on the leading
    edge of early adopters.</p><p>Over the past few years, however, I’ve drifted away.
    I’m not the only one.</p><p>There’s always been a financial cost to early adoption.
    My uncle amassed a collection of LaserDiscs, only to have to start over when DVDs
    won. For him, the long-term impact was limited: some money out of pocket and a
    slightly bruised ego. Now, the equation is very different.</p><blockquote><h1>The
    cost of a new device is no longer just financial: it’s also deeply personal.</h1></blockquote><p>Today,
    each new device we purchase is a conscious decision to share an intimate piece
    of ourselves with a company whose goals may not align with our own. This exchange
    represents a fundamental shift in our relationship with technology and the companies
    that produce it. Adoption is no longer an ephemeral transaction of money for goods.
    It’s a permanent choice of personal exposure for convenience—and not just while
    you use the product. If a product fails, or a company folds, or you just stop
    using it, the data you provided can live on in perpetuity. This new dynamic is
    the Faustian bargain of a connected life, and it changes the value equation involved
    in choosing to adopt the next big thing. Our decisions become less about features
    and capabilities, and more about trust.</p><p>When Amazon says, “Don’t worry,
    Alexa isn’t listening all the time,” we have to decide if we trust them. When
    Facebook <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8xjke5/facebook-knows-you-dont-want-to-trust-its-portal-camera">launches
    a video chat device</a> days after announcing a security <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/technology/facebook-hack-data-breach.html">breach
    impacting 50 million user accounts</a>, we have to decide if we’re willing to
    allow them to establish an ever-present eye in our home. When we plug in a new
    Nest thermostat for the first time, we have to decide if we are okay with Google
    peering into our daily habits. The cost of a new device is no longer just financial:
    it’s also deeply personal.</p><h2><strong>The diffusion of innovation</strong></h2><p>The
    adoption of new technologies is often represented on a normalized curve, with
    roughly 16 percent of the population falling into what is broadly characterized
    as early adopters.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*MAW_ox9XCMFGgty5HUoELg.png"
    alt="Innovation adoption curve via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DiffusionOfInnovation.png)"><em>Innovation
    adoption curve via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DiffusionOfInnovation.png">Wikipedia</a></em></p><p>Early
    adopters, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en">as
    Simon Sinek puts it</a>, are those who just get it. They understand what you’re
    doing, they see the value, and they’re here for it. The further you move into
    the curve, from the early majority to the laggards, the more you need to convince
    people to come along.</p><p>Early adopters have an optimistic enthusiasm and a
    higher tolerance for risk, both financial and social (remember the first people
    walking around with Google Glass?). It’s relatively easy to acquire them as customers.
    It doesn’t take a sophisticated marketing apparatus or a big budget to get them
    on board. As Sinek says, “Anyone can trip over [the first] 10 percent of the market.”
    Early adopters are critical because they create the fuel that allows an idea to
    gain momentum.</p><p>Early adopters provide initial cash flow and crucial product
    feedback, and they help establish social proof, showing more cautious consumers
    that this new thing is okay—all at a comparatively low cost of acquisition.</p><p>For
    a new product to find true mass market success, it has to move out of the early
    adopter group and gain acceptance in the early majority. This is sometimes referred
    to as crossing the chasm. Early adopters give new technologies the chance to make
    that leap. If companies had to invest in marketing to acquire more reticent consumer
    groups, the barrier to entry for new ideas would grow dramatically.</p><p>But
    what if early adopter enthusiasm began to erode? Is that optimistic 16 percent
    of the population immutable? Or is there a tipping point where the risk-to-value
    ratio flips and it no longer makes sense to be on the cutting edge?</p><h2><strong>What
    it means to “just get it” in the 21st century</strong></h2><p>There was something
    different about the <a href="https://portal.facebook.com/">Facebook Portal</a>
    launch. When the new video chat device hit the market, Facebook didn’t make a
    play for the typical early adopter group—young, tech-savvy consumers. Instead,
    they targeted the new device toward a less traditionally “techy” audience — <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FFur3Fnbac">older adults and young families</a>.
    You could make a lot of arguments as to why, but it comes back to the core principles
    of early adopters: they get what you’re doing, they see the value, and they’re
    here for it.</p><p>For Facebook, mired by endless scandals and data breaches,
    it became clear that the traditional early adopters did get what they were doing,
    but instead of value they saw risk, and they weren’t here for it. Facebook chose
    to target a less traditional demographic because the company felt they were less
    likely to see the possible risks.</p><p>Facebook Portal is a paragon of the new
    cost of early adoption. The product comes from a company whose relationship with
    consumers is shaky at best. It carries a lot of privacy implications. Hackers
    could access the camera, or the company could be flippant and irresponsible with
    the use and storage of video streams, as was reported with <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/01/10/amazon-ring-security-camera/">Amazon
    Ring</a>. On top of that, Portal is not just a new device, but also a new piece
    in the ecosystem of Facebook products, which represents a bigger underlying hazard
    that is even harder to grapple with.</p><blockquote><h1>Today, each new device
    we purchase is a conscious decision to share an intimate piece of ourselves with
    a company whose goals may not align with our own.</h1></blockquote><p>As the technology
    ecosystem has grown, the number and types of devices we feed our personal data
    into have expanded. But, as linear thinkers, we continue to assess risk based
    on the individual device. Take my internal dialogue about the Nest thermostat.
    My inclination was to assess my risk tolerance based on the isolated feature set
    of that device — tracking location and temperature. In reality, the full picture
    is much broader. The data from my Nest doesn’t live in isolation; it feeds back
    into the ever-growing data Frankenstein that Google is constructing about me.
    My Nest data is now intermingling with my Gmail data and search history and Google
    Maps history and so on. Various A.I. munges this data to drive more and more of
    my life experience.</p><p>A product ecosystem means the power inherent in a single
    device is no longer linear. As each new device folds into an increasingly intimate
    data portrait, companies are able to glean insights with each new data point at
    an exponential rate. This potentially translates to exponential value, but it
    also carries exponential risk. It’s hard, however, for us to assess this kind
    of threat. Humans have difficulty thinking exponentially, so we default to assessing
    each device on its own merits.</p><p>All of this means that to be tech-savvy today
    isn’t to enthusiastically embrace new technology, but to understand potential
    hazards and think critically and deeply about our choices. As Facebook Portal
    illustrates, that shift has the potential to change the curve of technology adoption.</p><h2><strong>Trust
    in the future</strong></h2><p>Over the past decade, our relationship with new
    technology has been tenuous. As early as 2012, a <a href="https://mashable.com/2012/09/05/smartphone-security/#5O3FjEF1XGq3">Pew
    Research study</a> found that 54 percent of smartphone users chose not to download
    certain apps based on privacy concerns. A similar <a href="https://econsultancy.com/66-of-smartphone-owners-are-worried-about-privacy-infographic/">study</a>
    in Great Britain in 2013 pegged that number at 66 percent. More recently, MusicWatch
    conducted a study on smart speaker use and found that 48 percent of respondents
    were concerned about privacy issues. As summarized by <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/musicwatch-survey-streaming-music/">Digital
    Trends</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Nearly half of the 5,000 U.S. consumers aged 13
    and older who were surveyed by MusicWatch, 48 percent specifically said they were
    concerned about privacy issues associated with their smart speakers, especially
    when using on-demand services like streaming music.</p></blockquote><p>Yet, despite
    our misgivings, technology marches on. Our concerns about smartphones have not
    slowed their growth, and MusicWatch found that 55 percent of people still reported
    using a smart speaker to stream music.</p><p>As Florian Schaub, a researcher studying
    privacy concerns and smart speaker adoption at the <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vba7xj/people-who-buy-smart-speakers-have-given-up-on-privacy-researchers-find">University
    of Michigan</a>, is quoted in Motherboard:</p><blockquote><p>What was really concerning
    to me was this idea that “it’s just a little bit more info you give Google or
    Amazon, and they already know a lot about you, so how is that bad?” It’s representative
    of this constant erosion of what privacy means and what our privacy expectations
    are.</p></blockquote><p>We’ve been engaged in this tug-of-war for years, pitting
    that persistent feeling of concern at the back of our minds against our often
    burning desire for the new. The coming decade may prove a litmus test for our
    long-term relationship with technology.</p><p>For years we have chosen to trust
    corporations with our personal data. Maybe it’s a cultural vestige of the technological
    optimism of postwar America, or maybe we are so eager to reach the future we’ve
    been promised that we are operating on blind faith. But there are signs that our
    enthusiasm is cracking. As we continue to hand over more of ourselves to companies,
    and as more of them fail to handle that relationship with respect, does there
    come a point when our goodwill dries up? Will trust always be something we give,
    or will it become something that must be earned? At what point does the cost of
    adoption become too high?</p>'

  :title: Our learnings from adopting GraphQL
  :content: '<p>A Marketing Tech Campaign</p><p>by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shtatnov/">Artem
    Shtatnov</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ducktyped">Ravi Srinivas Ranganathan</a></p><p>In
    an <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/https-medium-com-netflixtechblog-engineering-to-improve-marketing-effectiveness-part-2-7dd933974f5e">earlier
    blog post</a>, we provided a high-level overview of some of the applications in
    the Marketing Technology team that we build to enable <em>scale and intelligence</em>
    in driving our global advertising, which reaches users on sites like The New York
    Times, Youtube, and thousands of others. In this post, we’ll share our journey
    in updating our front-end architecture and our learnings in introducing GraphQL
    into the Marketing Tech system.</p><p>Our primary application for managing the
    creation and assembly of ads that reach the external publishing platforms is internally
    dubbed <strong><em>Monet</em></strong>. It’s used to supercharge ad creation and
    automate management of marketing campaigns on external ad platforms. Monet helps
    drive incremental conversions, engagement with our product and in general, present
    a rich story about our content and the Netflix brand to users around the world.
    To do this, first, it helps scale up and automate ad production and manage millions
    of creative permutations. Secondly, we utilize various signals and aggregate data
    such as understanding of content popularity on Netflix to enable highly relevant
    ads. Our overall aim is to make our ads on all the external publishing channels
    resonate well with users and we are constantly experimenting to improve our effectiveness
    in doing that.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2166/0*CafLBZiEtz9uwO62"
    alt="Monet and the high-level *Marketing Technology* flow"><em>Monet and the high-level
    *Marketing Technology</em> flow*</p><p>When we started out, the React UI layer
    for Monet accessed traditional REST APIs powered by an Apache Tomcat server. Over
    time, as our application evolved, our use cases became more complex. Simple pages
    would need to draw in data from a wide variety of sources. To more effectively
    load this data onto the client application, we first attempted to denormalize
    data on the backend. Managing this denormalization became difficult to maintain
    since not all pages needed all the data. We quickly ran into network bandwidth
    bottlenecks. The browser would need to fetch much more denormalized data than
    it would ever use.</p><p>To winnow down the number of fields sent to the client,
    one approach is to build custom endpoints for every page; it was a fairly obvious
    non-starter. Instead of building these custom endpoints, we opted for GraphQL
    as the middle layer of the app. We also considered <a href="https://netflix.github.io/falcor/">Falcor</a>
    as a possible solution since it has delivered great results at Netflix in many
    core use cases and has a ton of usage, but a robust GraphQL ecosystem and powerful
    third party tooling made GraphQL the better option for our use case. Also, as
    our data structures have become increasingly graph-oriented, it ended up being
    a very natural fit. Not only did adding GraphQL solve the network bandwidth bottleneck,
    but it also provided numerous other benefits that helped us add features more
    quickly.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*pmh-VimZJJindIJUyZtyzg.png"
    alt="Architecture before and after GraphQL"><em>Architecture before and after
    GraphQL</em></p><h2>Benefits</h2><p>We have been running GraphQL on NodeJS for
    about 6 months, and it has proven to significantly increase our development velocity
    and overall page load performance. Here are some of the benefits that worked out
    well for us since we started using it.</p><p><strong>Redistributing load and payload
    optimization</strong></p><p>Often times, some machines are better suited for certain
    tasks than others. When we added the GraphQL middle layer, the GraphQL server
    still needed to call the same services and REST APIs as the client would have
    called directly. The difference now is that the majority of the data is flowing
    between servers within the same data center. These server to server calls are
    of very low latency and high bandwidth, which gives us about an 8x performance
    boost compared to direct network calls from the browser. The last mile of the
    data transfer from the GraphQL server to the client browser, although still a
    slow point, is now reduced to a single network call. Since GraphQL allows the
    client to select only the data it needs we end up fetching a significantly smaller
    payload. In our application, pages that were fetching 10MB of data before now
    receive about 200KB. Page loads became much faster, especially over data-constrained
    mobile networks, and our app uses much less memory. These changes did come at
    the cost of higher server utilization to perform data fetching and aggregation,
    but the few extra milliseconds of server time per request were greatly outweighed
    by the smaller client payloads.</p><p><strong>Reusable abstractions</strong></p><p>Software
    developers generally want to work with reusable abstractions instead of single-purpose
    methods. With GraphQL, we define each piece of data once and define how it relates
    to other data in our system. When the consumer application fetches data from multiple
    sources, it no longer needs to worry about the complex business logic associated
    with data join operations.</p><p>Consider the following example, we define entities
    in GraphQL exactly once: <em>catalogs, creatives, and comments</em>. We can now
    build the views for several pages from these definitions. One page on the client
    app (catalogView) declares that it wants all comments for all creatives in a catalog
    while another client page (creativeView) wants to know the associated catalog
    that a creative belongs to, along with all of its comments.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Tr-cnrbTOPKkWkshYpQeIA.png"
    alt="The flexibility of the GraphQL data model to represent different views from
    the same underlying data"><em>The flexibility of the GraphQL data model to represent
    different views from the same underlying data</em></p><p>The same graph model
    can power both of these views without having to make any server side code changes.</p><p><strong>Chaining
    type systems</strong></p><p>Many people focus on type systems within a single
    service, but rarely across services. Once we defined the entities in our GraphQL
    server, we use auto codegen tools to generate TypeScript types for the client
    application. The props of our React components receive types to match the query
    that the component is making. Since these types and queries are also validated
    against the server schema, any breaking change by the server would be caught by
    clients consuming the data. Chaining multiple services together with GraphQL and
    hooking these checks into the build process allows us to catch many more issues
    before deploying bad code. Ideally, we would like to have type safety from the
    database layer all the way to the client browser.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*YLL0aFFgcGDXFEa-V9_LPA.png"
    alt="Type safety from database to backend to client code"><em>Type safety from
    database to backend to client code</em></p><p><strong>DI/DX — Simplifying development</strong></p><p>A
    common concern when creating client applications is the UI/UX, but the developer
    interface and developer experience is just as important for building maintainable
    apps. Before GraphQL, writing a new React container component required maintaining
    complex logic to make network requests for the data we need. The developer would
    need to consider how one piece of data relates to another, how the data should
    be cached, whether to make the calls in parallel or in sequence and where in Redux
    to store the data. With a GraphQL query wrapper, each React component only needs
    to describe the data it needs, and the wrapper takes care of all of these concerns.
    There is much less boilerplate code and a cleaner separation of concerns between
    the data and UI. This model of declarative data fetching makes the React components
    much easier to understand, and serves to partially document what the component
    is doing.</p><p><strong>Other benefits</strong></p><p>There are a few other smaller
    benefits that we noticed as well. First, if any resolver of the GraphQL query
    fails, the resolvers that succeeded still return data to the client to render
    as much of the page as possible. Second, the backend data model is greatly simplified
    since we are less concerned with modeling for the client and in most cases can
    simply provide a CRUD interface to raw entities. Finally, testing our components
    has also become easier since the GraphQL query is automatically translatable into
    stubs for our tests and we can test resolvers in isolation from the React components.</p><h2>Growing
    pains</h2><p>Our migration to GraphQL was a straightforward experience. Most of
    the infrastructure we built to make network requests and transform data was easily
    transferable from our React application to our NodeJS server without any code
    changes. We even ended up deleting more code than we added. But as with any migration
    to a new technology, there were a few obstacles we needed to overcome.</p><p><strong>Selfish
    resolvers</strong></p><p>Since resolvers in GraphQL are meant to run as isolated
    units that are not concerned with what other resolvers do, we found that they
    were making many duplicate network requests for the same or similar data. We got
    around this duplication by wrapping the data providers in a simple caching layer
    that stored network responses in memory until all resolvers finished. The caching
    layer also allowed us to aggregate multiple requests to a single service into
    a bulk request for all the data at once. Resolvers can now request any data they
    need without worrying about how to optimize the process of fetching it.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2038/1*FZCtNPL4bXS6jpgVZx0RYg.png" alt="Adding
    a cache to simplify data access from resolvers"><em>Adding a cache to simplify
    data access from resolvers</em></p><p><strong>What a tangled web we weave</strong></p><p>Abstractions
    are a great way to make developers more efficient… until something goes wrong.
    There will undoubtedly be bugs in our code and we didn’t want to obfuscate the
    root cause with a middle layer. GraphQL would orchestrate network calls to other
    services automatically, hiding the complexities from the user. Server logs provide
    a way to debug, but they are still one step removed from the natural approach
    of debugging via the browser’s network tab. To make debugging easier, we added
    logs directly to the GraphQL response payload that expose all of the network requests
    that the server is making. When the debug flag is enabled, you get the same data
    in the client browser as you would if the browser made the network call directly.</p><p><strong>Breaking
    down typing</strong></p><p>Passing around objects is what OOP is all about, but
    unfortunately, GraphQL throws a wrench into this paradigm. When we fetch partial
    objects, this data cannot be used in methods and components that require the full
    object. Of course, you can cast the object manually and hope for the best, but
    you lose many of the benefits of type systems. Luckily, TypeScript uses duck typing,
    so adjusting the methods to only require the object properties that they really
    need was the quickest fix. Defining these more precise types takes a bit more
    work, but gives greater type safety overall.</p><h2>What comes next</h2><p>We
    are still in the early stages in our exploration of GraphQL, but it’s been a positive
    experience so far and we’re happy to have embraced it. One of the key goals of
    this endeavor was to help us get increased development velocity as our systems
    become increasingly sophisticated. Instead of being bogged down with complex data
    structures, we hope for the investment in the graph data model to make our team
    more productive over time as more edges and nodes are added. Even over the last
    few months, we have found that our existing graph model has become sufficiently
    robust that we don’t need any graph changes to be able to build some features.
    It has certainly made us more productive.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*T3KO2GOY6EhoWUdQw8zuLQ.png"
    alt="Visualization of our GraphQL Schema"><em>Visualization of our GraphQL Schema</em></p><p>As
    GraphQL continues to thrive and mature, we look forward to learning from all the
    amazing things that the community can build and solve with it. On an implementation
    level, we are looking forward to using some cool concepts like schema stitching,
    which can make integrations with other services much more straightforward and
    save a great deal of developer time. Most crucially, it’s very exciting to see
    a lot more teams <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/the-new-netflix-stethoscope-native-app-f4e1d38aafcd">across
    our company</a> see GraphQL’s potential and start to adopt it.</p><p>If you’ve

  :title: Python at Netflix
  :content: '<p>By Pythonistas at Netflix, coordinated by Amjith Ramanujam and edited
    by Ellen Livengood</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*PPIp7twJJUknfohZqtL8pQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>As many of us prepare to go to PyCon, we wanted to share a sampling
    of how Python is used at Netflix. We use Python through the full content lifecycle,
    from deciding which content to fund all the way to operating the CDN that serves
    the final video to 148 million members. We use and contribute to many open-source
    Python packages, some of which are mentioned below. If any of this interests you,
    check out the <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/search?q=python">jobs site</a>
    or find us at PyCon. We have donated a few Netflix Originals posters to the <a
    href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/auction/">PyLadies Auction</a> and look
    forward to seeing you all there.</p><h3>Open Connect</h3><p><a href="https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/">Open
    Connect</a> is Netflix’s content delivery network (CDN). An easy, though imprecise,
    way of thinking about Netflix infrastructure is that everything that happens before
    you press Play on your remote control (e.g., are you logged in? what plan do you
    have? what have you watched so we can recommend new titles to you? what do you
    want to watch?) takes place in Amazon Web Services (AWS), whereas everything that
    happens afterwards (i.e., video streaming) takes place in the Open Connect network.
    Content is placed on the network of servers in the Open Connect CDN as close to
    the end user as possible, improving the streaming experience for our customers
    and reducing costs for both Netflix and our Internet Service Provider (ISP) partners.</p><p>Various
    software systems are needed to design, build, and operate this CDN infrastructure,
    and a significant number of them are written in Python. The network devices that
    underlie a large portion of the CDN are mostly managed by Python applications.
    Such applications track the inventory of our network gear: what devices, of which
    models, with which hardware components, located in which sites. The configuration
    of these devices is controlled by several other systems including source of truth,
    application of configurations to devices, and back up. Device interaction for
    the collection of health and other operational data is yet another Python application.
    Python has long been a popular programming language in the networking space because
    it’s an intuitive language that allows engineers to quickly solve networking problems.
    Subsequently, many useful libraries get developed, making the language even more
    desirable to learn and use.</p><h3>Demand Engineering</h3><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-demand-engineering-aaron-blohowiak/">Demand
    Engineering</a> is responsible for <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/4/how-netflix-does-failovers-7-minutes-flat">Regional
    Failovers</a>, Traffic Distribution, Capacity Operations, and Fleet Efficiency
    of the Netflix cloud. We are proud to say that our team’s tools are built primarily
    in Python. The service that orchestrates failover uses numpy and scipy to perform
    numerical analysis, boto3 to make changes to our AWS infrastructure, rq to run
    asynchronous workloads and we wrap it all up in a thin layer of Flask APIs. The
    ability to drop into a <a href="https://bpython-interpreter.org">bpython</a> shell
    and improvise has saved the day more than once.</p><p>We are heavy users of Jupyter
    Notebooks and <a href="https://nteract.io">nteract</a> to analyze operational
    data and prototype <a href="https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/master/packages/data-explorer">visualization
    tools </a>that help us detect capacity regressions.</p><h3>CORE</h3><p>The CORE
    team uses Python in our alerting and statistical analytical work. We lean on many
    of the statistical and mathematical libraries (numpy, scipy, ruptures, pandas)
    to help automate the analysis of 1000s of related signals when our alerting systems
    indicate problems. We’ve developed a time series correlation system used both
    inside and outside the team as well as a distributed worker system to parallelize
    large amounts of analytical work to deliver results quickly.</p><p>Python is also
    a tool we typically use for automation tasks, data exploration and cleaning, and
    as a convenient source for visualization work.</p><h3>Monitoring, alerting and
    auto-remediation</h3><p>The Insight Engineering team is responsible for building
    and operating the tools for operational insight, alerting, diagnostics, and auto-remediation.
    With the increased popularity of Python, the team now supports Python clients
    for most of their services. One example is the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/spectator-py">Spectator</a>
    Python client library, a library for instrumenting code to record dimensional
    time series metrics. We build Python libraries to interact with other Netflix
    platform level services. In addition to libraries, the <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/introducing-winston-event-driven-diagnostic-and-remediation-platform-46ce39aa81cc">Winston</a>
    and <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/introducing-bolt-on-instance-diagnostic-and-remediation-platform-176651b55505">Bolt</a>
    products are also built using Python frameworks (Gunicorn + Flask + Flask-RESTPlus).</p><h3>Information
    Security</h3><p>The information security team uses Python to accomplish a number
    of high leverage goals for Netflix: security automation, risk classification,
    auto-remediation, and vulnerability identification to name a few. We’ve had a
    number of successful Python open sources, including <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/security_monkey">Security
    Monkey</a> (our team’s most active open source project). We leverage Python to
    protect our SSH resources using <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/bless">Bless</a>.
    Our Infrastructure Security team leverages Python to help with IAM permission
    tuning using <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/repokid">Repokid</a>. We use
    Python to help generate TLS certificates using <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/lemur">Lemur</a>.</p><p>Some
    of our more recent projects include Prism: a batch framework to help security
    engineers measure paved road adoption, risk factors, and identify vulnerabilities
    in source code. We currently provide Python and Ruby libraries for Prism. The
    <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/netflix-sirt-releases-diffy-a-differencing-engine-for-digital-forensics-in-the-cloud-37b71abd2698">Diffy</a>
    forensics triage tool is written entirely in Python. We also use Python to detect
    sensitive data using Lanius.</p><h3>Personalization Algorithms</h3><p>We use Python
    extensively within our broader <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/FaisalZakariaSiddiqi/ml-infra-for-netflix-recommendations-ai-nextcon-talk">Personalization
    Machine Learning Infrastructure</a> to train some of the Machine Learning models
    for key aspects of the Netflix experience: from our <a href="https://research.netflix.com/research-area/recommendations">recommendation
    algorithms</a> to <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/artwork-personalization-c589f074ad76">artwork
    personalization</a> to <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/engineering-to-scale-paid-media-campaigns-84ba018fb3fa">marketing
    algorithms</a>. For example, some algorithms use TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch
    to learn Deep Neural Networks, XGBoost and LightGBM to learn Gradient Boosted
    Decision Trees or the broader scientific stack in Python (e.g. numpy, scipy, sklearn,
    matplotlib, pandas, cvxpy). Because we’re constantly trying out new approaches,
    we use Jupyter Notebooks to drive many of our experiments. We have also developed
    a number of higher-level libraries to help integrate these with the rest of our
    <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/FaisalZakariaSiddiqi/ml-infra-for-netflix-recommendations-ai-nextcon-talk">ecosystem</a>
    (e.g. data access, fact logging and feature extraction, model evaluation, and
    publishing).</p><h3>Machine Learning Infrastructure</h3><p>Besides personalization,
    Netflix applies machine learning to hundreds of use cases across the company.
    Many of these applications are powered by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV5VGddmP24">Metaflow</a>,
    a Python framework that makes it easy to execute ML projects from the prototype
    stage to production.</p><p>Metaflow pushes the limits of Python: We leverage well
    parallelized and optimized Python code to fetch data at 10Gbps, handle hundreds
    of millions of data points in memory, and orchestrate computation over tens of
    thousands of CPU cores.</p><h3>Notebooks</h3><p>We are avid users of Jupyter notebooks
    at Netflix, and we’ve written about the <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233">reasons
    and nature of this investment</a> before.</p><p>But Python plays a huge role in
    how we provide those services. Python is a primary language when we need to develop,
    debug, explore, and prototype different interactions with the Jupyter ecosystem.
    We use Python to build custom extensions to the Jupyter server that allows us
    to manage tasks like logging, archiving, publishing, and cloning notebooks on
    behalf of our users.We provide many flavors of Python to our users via different
    Jupyter kernels, and manage the deployment of those kernel specifications using
    Python.</p><h3>Orchestration</h3><p>The Big Data Orchestration team is responsible
    for providing all of the services and tooling to schedule and execute ETL and
    Adhoc pipelines.</p><p>Many of the components of the orchestration service are
    written in Python. Starting with our scheduler, which uses<a href="https://jupyter.org">
    Jupyter Notebooks</a> with <a href="https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">papermill</a>
    to provide templatized job types (Spark, Presto, …). This allows our users to
    have a standardized and easy way to express work that needs to be executed. You
    can see some deeper details on the subject <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/scheduling-notebooks-348e6c14cfd6">here</a>.
    We have been using notebooks as real runbooks for situations where human intervention
    is required — for example: to restart everything that has failed in the last hour.</p><p>Internally,
    we also built an event-driven platform that is fully written in Python. We have
    created streams of events from a number of systems that get unified into a single
    tool. This allows us to define conditions to filter events, and actions to react
    or route them. As a result of this, we have been able to decouple microservices
    and get visibility into everything that happens on the data platform.</p><p>Our
    team also built the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/pygenie">pygenie</a> client
    which interfaces with <a href="https://netflix.github.io/genie/">Genie</a>, a
    federated job execution service. Internally, we have additional extensions to
    this library that apply business conventions and integrate with the Netflix platform.
    These libraries are the primary way users interface programmatically with work
    in the Big Data platform.</p><p>Finally, it’s been our team’s commitment to contribute
    to <a href="https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">papermill</a> and <a
    href="https://nteract-scrapbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">scrapbook</a> open
    source projects. Our work there has been both for our own and external use cases.
    These efforts have been gaining a lot of traction in the open source community
    and we’re glad to be able to contribute to these shared projects.</p><h3>Experimentation
    Platform</h3><p>The scientific computing team for experimentation is creating
    a platform for scientists and engineers to analyze AB tests and other experiments.
    Scientists and engineers can contribute new innovations on three fronts, data,
    statistics, and visualizations.</p><p>The Metrics Repo is a Python framework based
    on <a href="https://pypika.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyPika</a> that allows contributors
    to write reusable parameterized SQL queries. It serves as an entry point into
    any new analysis.</p><p>The Causal Models library is a Python &amp; R framework
    for scientists to contribute new models for causal inference. It leverages <a
    href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/">PyArrow</a> and <a href="https://rpy2.readthedocs.io/en/version_2.8.x/">RPy2</a>
    so that statistics can be calculated seamlessly in either language.</p><p>The
    Visualizations library is based on <a href="https://plot.ly">Plotly</a>. Since
    Plotly is a widely adopted visualization spec, there are a variety of tools that
    allow contributors to produce an output that is consumable by our platforms.</p><h3>Partner
    Ecosystem</h3><p>The Partner Ecosystem group is expanding its use of Python for
    testing Netflix applications on devices. Python is forming the core of a new CI
    infrastructure, including controlling our orchestration servers, controlling Spinnaker,
    test case querying and filtering, and scheduling test runs on devices and containers.
    Additional post-run analysis is being done in Python using TensorFlow to determine
    which tests are most likely to show problems on which devices.</p><h3>Video Encoding
    and Media Cloud Engineering</h3><p>Our team takes care of encoding (and re-encoding)
    the Netflix catalog, as well as leveraging machine learning for insights into
    that catalog.We use Python for ~50 projects such as <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/blob/master/resource/doc/references.md">vmaf</a>

  :title: What You Need to Know About the Future of Bitcoin Technology
  :content: '<p>Bitcoin (BTC) recently smashed an all-time high of $11,400 USD and
    subsequently dropped to as low as $8,595 within a few hours. It’s incredibly important
    to not get lost in the pandemonium and to stay informed about how Bitcoin is progressing
    technologically.</p><p>Anybody considering buying Bitcoin should at the very least
    learn two things:</p><ol><li><p>the history of the technology behind Bitcoin</p></li><li><p>and
    more importantly, what lies ahead in Bitcoin’s future.</p></li></ol><p>As Bitcoin
    expert <a href="undefined">Andreas M. Antonopoulos</a> says, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=328&v=6uXAbJQoZlE">Invest
    in education instead of speculation</a>.”</p><p>With Bitcoin and its underlying
    blockchain being such incredibly new technological concepts, it can seem daunting
    at times to try and research and understand its underlying technical details.
    This article is written in an effort to highlight the scalability problem Bitcoin
    faces, and what expected or proposed solutions to that problem are. There are
    some really exciting ones out there that this article discusses!</p><p>I wrote
    this as I was learning about Bitcoin myself, to aggregate the great amount of
    information about Bitcoin’s future from countless sources out there. When writing
    this, I kept in mind even those who don’t possess a programming background. However,
    it is assumed that the reader has a very basic understanding of Bitcoin as a currency
    and what a blockchain is. Coindesk has a great 5-minute read that should get you
    up to speed <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-bitcoin/">here</a>
    if you’re just starting out with Bitcoin or if you need a refresher.</p><p>Let’s
    begin with the scalability problem Bitcoin faces.</p><h2><strong>The Transaction
    Throughput Problem</strong></h2><p>When Bitcoin was first introduced to the world,
    its creator Satoshi Nakomoto described Bitcoin in the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin
    whitepaper</a> as “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow
    online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through
    a financial institution.”</p><p>One of Bitcoin’s fundamental values was instant
    and secure peer-to-peer payment transactions. Now, more than ever, Bitcoin is
    emerging as the prevailing cryptocurrency in the global market, with a 1,200%+
    increase in value over the last year alone.</p><p>Because of this unprecedented
    growth, the number of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain has also increased,
    with up to <a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions">400,000 transactions
    per day</a> being conducted. This rapid increase in transactions is posing to
    be a serious scalability problem for the blockchain, with <a href="https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions">over
    90,000 transactions</a> being backlogged as unconfirmed at the moment.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*kDRKF6Iu3wPbSByqSr32gw.png" alt="As
    Bitcoin’s price skyrockets, so does its usage. Note the stagnation at around 400,000
    transactions per day"><em>As Bitcoin’s price skyrockets, so does its usage. Note
    the stagnation at around 400,000 transactions per day</em></p><p>In order to understand
    why transactions are being backlogged, Bitcoin transactions must first be explained.</p><p>Every
    time a user sends a Bitcoin transaction from his or her wallet to another, the
    transaction is added into the <strong>memory pool</strong> (mempool), which is
    essentially a pool of all unconfirmed transactions in the Bitcoin network. This
    pool is upheld by individual memory pools on machines that also hold a copy of
    the blockchain ledger, called <strong>nodes</strong>.</p><p>From the mempool,
    miners select transactions that they want to verify. Once miners validate a transaction
    (i.e. confirm that the sender actually has enough bitcoins to send to the receiver),
    they add it to a new block, which is eventually published to the blockchain. Other
    nodes then iterate through this newly published block’s transactions to ensure
    the block is valid, before accepting the block as a part of its ledger.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2480/1*K6iO4o2oxd0IeU0luVze0w.png" alt="A
    diagram of the transaction lifecycle, source:[ weusecoins.com](https://www.weusecoins.com/en/questions/)"><em>A
    diagram of the transaction lifecycle, source:<a href="https://www.weusecoins.com/en/questions/">
    weusecoins.com</a></em></p><p>Let’s calculate the throughput of transactions:</p><ul><li><p>The
    median transaction size <a href="https://tradeblock.com/blog/analysis-of-bitcoin-transaction-size-trends">approximately
    250 bytes</a></p></li><li><p>A block’s size is limited to 1MB (1000000 bytes)</p></li><li><p>Thus,
    a block holds around 4000 transactions (1MB divided by 250 bytes)</p></li><li><p>A
    block can only be published to the blockchain once every 10 minutes on average
    (600 seconds).</p></li><li><p>4000 transactions (at most) are published every
    600 seconds, at a rate of <strong>6.66 transactions / second</strong></p></li></ul><p>With
    over 90,000 unconfirmed transactions in the mempool, how does a miner select which
    transactions to verify? Transaction fees! The sender of a transaction has the
    option of adding a custom transaction fee to its transaction intended for the
    miner, incentivizing a miner to select the transaction and have it verified faster.
    Miners will select the transactions that have the highest fee attached to them
    to maximize profits. Theoretically, you can send a transaction with no fee. But
    if there are transactions that have fees higher than yours in the pool, why would
    yours ever get picked?</p><p>As Bitcoin’s user base grows, so does the average
    transaction fee. At most, there are only 7 transactions that are processed every
    second and everyone wants to get their transaction verified first. At the moment,
    the average transaction fee is approximately <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-median_transaction_fee.html">$3.58
    USD</a>. This fee is certainly not ideal — if you want to send your friend a couple
    of dollars worth of bitcoin, you may end up spending more in transaction fees
    than the transaction value itself! Therein lies the problem, and if all else remains
    equal, transaction fees can be expected to rise due to the transaction bottleneck.</p><h2><strong>Solving
    the Throughput Problem</strong></h2><p>A proposed solution to this bottleneck
    that has brought great controversy to the Bitcoin community is to simply raise
    the block size from the original 1MB limit, thus allowing more transactions per
    block.</p><p>Every time the block size is increased in the chain, a <strong>hard
    fork</strong> is required, meaning an entirely new copy of the chain must be created,
    therefore requiring consensus from the Bitcoin community. Because millions of
    people use Bitcoin, gaining consensus is difficult and efforts should be made
    to avoid it. Furthermore, although the block size can be increased enough to accommodate
    the current backlog of transactions, as Bitcoin’s userbase continues to grow,
    there will eventually be another backlog of unconfirmed transactions, so another
    block size increase will be needed, and subsequently another hard fork.</p><p>So
    why don’t we just make the block size large enough to ensure the throughput will
    never be a bottleneck, no matter how many people are using it? First, the mathematics
    of a block size even remotely large enough to handle mass adoption are impractical
    and will restrict mining to incredibly powerful machines that only large corporations
    will be able to maintain, introducing an element of centralization.</p><p><img

    a block size big enough for just one city’s population, it would restrict node

    hosting and mining to only those with the most powerful machines, i.e. massive
    businesses, source: <a href="https://lightning.network/lightning-network.pdf">Lightning
    Network</a></em></p><p>Furthermore, recall that once a block is mined, all other
    nodes must validate the block before accepting it. If the block size was incredibly
    large and somebody were to publish an invalid block, nodes would waste a large
    amount of time attempting to validate the block before discarding it as invalid
    and moving onto the next block. A denial of service attack can essentially be
    orchestrated by repeatedly publishing insanely large invalid blocks to the network,
    stopping valid blocks from being processed for a long period of time. As stated
    by blockchain pioneer Nick Szabo in <a href="https://medium.com/@giftedproducts/cryptocurrencies-with-tim-ferriss-nick-szabo-and-naval-ravikant-51a99d037e04">this
    interview</a>, the small block size acts as a technical security parameter to
    prevent network flooding.</p><p>You can read more about the full impact of an
    increased block size if Bitcoin were to take over the world, in an article I’ve
    written <a href="https://hackernoon.com/if-we-lived-in-a-bitcoin-future-how-big-would-the-blockchain-have-to-be-bd07b282416f">here</a>.</p><p>If
    we can’t increase the block size, what can we do? Luckily, there are several solutions
    in the works that are expected to be deployed in order to solve this issue.</p><h2><strong>Segregated
    Witness (SegWit)</strong></h2><p>Segregated Witness (SegWit) has actually already
    been implemented into the Bitcoin network, as of August 2017. It’s a fundamental
    network change that modifies the format of transactions, essentially slimming
    them down in size, and allowing more transactions to be fit into a block which
    increases throughput. SegWit is considered a <strong>soft fork</strong>, meaning
    it is completely backwards compatible with existing Bitcoin protocol, although
    nodes and wallets must upgrade to take advantage of all SegWit features.</p><p>Each
    transaction has a signature from the sender, or in other words, <strong>witness
    data</strong>; this is usually the largest part of the transaction. This data
    is not actually necessary to verify the transaction, and so SegWit moves this
    data to the end of the transaction, <em>segregating</em> it. If this transaction
    is sent to a legacy node (a node that has not upgraded to SegWit), the node strips
    the witness data off the end of the transaction before inserting it into a block,
    thus reducing the overall transaction size and saving space. The added benefit
    of this is that nodes can no longer modify the witness data, changing who the
    transaction was from, an ability nodes previously had. This makes way for the
    implementation of multi-layer solutions that we’ll discuss soon. Users also save
    on transaction fees, as they’re usually calculated per transaction byte, and SegWit
    reduces total transaction size.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2404/1*4IKDVzPN0FzJFgOnZADoIQ.png"
    alt="SegWit moves signature data to the end of transaction, after which stripped

    Blockchains</a></em></p><p>Furthermore, SegWit changes the definition of a block:
    instead of a block being defined in terms of bytes, its now defined in terms of
    “weights”; a block can have a maximum weight of 4,000. Legacy transactions have
    a weight of 4, while SegWit transactions have a weight of 0.25, thus enabling
    a block to contain many more SegWit transactions and have a slightly higher size
    (approximately 2 megabytes at most). Nodes must upgrade to SegWit to follow this
    definition, and wallets must incorporate SegWit in order to send SegWit transactions.
    As a result, SegWit adoption has been slow, accounting for only 12% of current
    traffic.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5136/1*GQjWddG72KhXJYQ3k-bnQg.png"

    of the aforementioned benefits of SegWit, I highly encourage anybody reading this
    to use wallets that have incorporated SegWit to speed up SegWit adoption. A neat
    list of them can be found <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/">here</a>
    (my personal favourite is <a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/">Samourai Wallet

    Solutions</strong></h2><p>As it stands, the Bitcoin blockchain isn’t very feasible
    for micropayments. If you want to buy a $2 cup of coffee, you’re probably going
    to pay more than $2 equivalent of BTC in transaction fees, and the transaction
    won’t be confirmed instantly — you must wait for the transaction to be published
    in a verified block on the chain, which will appear within 10 minutes at best.</p><p>Second
    and third layer solutions are networks layered on top of the Bitcoin blockchain
    that enable users to send several transactions of small amounts of Bitcoin almost
    instantly, with no transaction fees.</p><p><strong>The Lightning Network</strong>
    is this layered network currently in development expected to alleviate Bitcoin’s
    scaling problems. This network consists of two additional layers and enables users
    to open direct channels between each other to send an effectively unlimited number
    of payments to each other in an instant manner.<a href="https://lightning.network/"><strong>Lightning
    Network</strong><em>The Lightning Network is dependent upon the underlying technology
    of the blockchain. By using real Bitcoin/blockchain…</em>lightning.network</a></p><h3>The
    Second Layer</h3><p>A user joins the second layer network by conducting a transaction
    on the blockchain that declares the user is committing a certain number of bitcoin
    to be used in the layered network. The user then joins a group of nodes that are
    interconnected with one another, called <strong>channel factories</strong>. These
    nodes essentially uphold a lobby of individuals that potentially want to conduct
    transactions with one another. Channel factories then enable an unlimited number
    of micropayment channels to be created on the third layer (hence the name factories)
    between individual parties.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*AjpC5PHSLvJ-drKZI-7JpA.png"

    users are hooked into a channel factory upon joining the network, which then allocates
    multiple micropayment channels</em></p><h3>The Third Layer</h3><p>Micropayment
    channels are set up to ensure direct payments between two users on the third layer.
    Because the blockchain is no longer present in this layer, it cannot be used to
    validate transactions and ensure one party paid the other. Instead, smart-contract
    technology is employed, such as <strong>multisig addresses</strong>, meaning addresses
    that can be signed off by multiple users to enable the movement of funds, and
    <strong>hashed time-lock contracts</strong>, which are cryptographically secure
    automated contracts that lock funds for a certain period of time to ensure one
    parties that cannot cheat with another. These technologies eliminate the need
    for trust between users that are connected in micropayment channels.</p><p>Here
    is an example of how a Lightning Network micropayment channel works:</p><ol><li><p>Alice
    wants to dedicate 1 Bitcoin to a micropayment channel between Bob. She declares
    this 1 Bitcoin to be used in a <strong>commitment transaction</strong> on the
    Bitcoin blockchain. This 1 Bitcoin is then locked up in a <strong>multisig address
    *<em>that both parties can sign off on if they want to close the channel. This
    address is secured with a *</em>hashed time-lock contract</strong> which states,
    “Alice has 1 BTC and Bob has 0 BTC, to be released in one hour”. This means the
    1 Bitcoin Alice has is locked for 1 hour after which it will be returned to Alice
    and published to the Bitcoin blockchain once more.</p></li><li><p>Alice then decides
    to give Bob 0.1 BTC. This transaction is logged with a new hashed time-lock contract
    stating “Alice has 0.9 BTC and Bob has 0.1 BTC, to be expired in 50 minutes”.
    This contract has an expiry time of 50 minutes, meaning it will be published to
    the blockchain before the original contract stating Alice has 1 BTC. Therefore
    Bob instantly knows he has the 0.1 BTC because this new contract will be published
    to the blockchain before the original contract, essentially making the old contract
    invalid.</p></li><li><p>Once the full hour passes, the micropayment channel closes
    and the final balance between Alice and Bob is published to the blockchain. If
    Alice and Bob want to continue making transactions, they can extend the expiry
    time of their channel for as long as they want. If one of them wants to close
    the channel early, one of them needs to sign off on the original multisig address
    that the Bitcoin is stored in.</p></li></ol><p>The network enables transactions
    to route itself to its final destination by using other connected users in the
    channel as intermediaries. This can happen even if a direct connection to the
    desired user isn’t able to be sought the current micropayment channel. For example,
    if Alice has a channel open with Bob, and Bob has a channel with Mark, and Alice
    wants to send Mark some Bitcoin, the network can route the payment to Mark through
    Bob, all while ensuring no party has to trust another.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3544/1*qtUo7s-5lIOhoxUKe7w99g.png"
    alt="In the lightning network, transactions are routed through intermediate users
    in order to reach its final destination"><em>In the lightning network, transactions
    are routed through intermediate users in order to reach its final destination</em></p><p>The
    implementation of lightning network transactions and their trust-less nature can
    get incredibly complex, and is best explained by the Lightning developers in <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zVzw912wPo">this conference</a> or in the
    following series by <a href="undefined">ecurrencyhodler</a>:<a href="https://medium.com/the-litecoin-school-of-crypto/a-primer-to-the-lightning-network-part-1-be909c403bde"><strong>The
    Lightning Network (Part 1)</strong><em>Multisig Addresses: The Building Blocks
    of the Lightning Network</em>medium.com</a></p><p>Ideally, a user will only create
    a commitment transaction to the secondary layer very rarely because he or she
    will remain in the layered network for prolonged periods of time to conduct most
    of their day-to-day transactions. Once a user wants to exit this multi-layered
    network, a *<em>settlement transaction *</em>is made on the blockchain declaring
    the user’s final Bitcoin balance after all of the second-layer activities. This
    reconciles their total Bitcoin balance on the blockchain after comparison with
    the original commitment transaction. In total, only two blockchain transactions
    are made in order to let the user to conduct a limitless number of transactions
    for free on the second layer.</p><p>As mentioned previously, SegWit paves the
    way for the lightning network because it removes nodes’ abilities to modify witness
    data, which is what is used to identify a user’s entry into the second layer.
    If the user’s commitment transaction can’t be found because the witness data referring
    to the user was changed, there is a greater level of difficulty involved when
    trying to reconcile the user’s settlement transaction.</p><p>The second layer
    of the lightning network involving channel factories was very recently introduced
    in <a href="https://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/a20a865ce40d40c8f942cf206a7cba96/Scalable_Funding_Of_Blockchain_Micropayment_Networks%20(1).pdf">this
    whitepaper</a>. It is still under heavy development, so a lot of its concepts
    are explained abstractly. However, the network is poised to launch in 2018 and
    will be by far the biggest improvement in transaction scalability thus far.</p><h2><strong>Schnorr
    Signatures</strong></h2><p>When a user sends a Bitcoin transaction, the inputs
    of the transaction (the amount you’re sending) is calculated simply by retrieving
    from the blockchain the total unspent amounts of Bitcoin you previously received.
    So for example:</p><ul><li><p>Starting with an empty wallet, I receive 1 Bitcoin
    in transaction #1, and then another 1 Bitcoin in a separate transaction #2</p></li><li><p>I
    now want to send 2 Bitcoins in a transaction. There will be two inputs to this
    transaction: transaction #1, and transaction #2, summing up to 2 Bitcoin</p></li></ul><p>Under
    the current algorithm for generating signatures (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
    Algorithm), each input requires its own signature. This increases the total transaction
    size and therefore increases the transaction fee.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2648/1*byA4UmLgEij_1oGp2EaLjg.png"

    signatures</a> are an alternative and more efficient way of storing signature
    data in transactions. All inputs are accumulated and then stored as a single signature
    by utilizing the Schnorr algorithm, which greatly saves space in a transaction
    and further helps increase transaction throughput by allowing blocks to store
    more transactions on average.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2404/1*22yyLNKn02a-D7YsDgRw5A.png"

    sender signatures are stored as one signature under the Schnorr algorithm</em></p><p>Schnorr
    signatures can be also be used to aid Bitcoin’s advancement in privacy by benefiting
    CoinJoin transactions. CoinJoin is a method of introducing anonymity to Bitcoin
    transactions. It works by pooling transaction inputs together with other peoples’
    transactions when making a payment to a receiver. When payments are pooled, it
    becomes difficult to track which user sent what input, effectively making them
    anonymous. However, CoinJoin transactions have increased fees due to a higher
    number of inputs in a single transaction resulting in a higher number of signatures.
    Utilizing Schnorr signatures would enable all signatures in a transaction to be
    compressed into one, saving greatly on transaction fees and encouraging the use
    of CoinJoin.</p><p>Furthermore, Schnorr paves the way for complex multisig transactions
    which require signing off from multiple parties; no matter how many parties’ signatures
    are required for a transaction, all the transaction needs is one Schnorr signature.</p><p>Schnorr
    signatures are only now a possibility because of the implementation of SegWit;
    because signature data can’t be modified by third parties, it can now be used
    to effectively create a Schnorr signature.</p><h2><strong>MimbleWimble</strong></h2><p>MimbleWimble
    is a radical but incredibly powerful proposed change to Bitcoin architecture that
    was anonymously introduced through this <a href="https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/wizardry/mimblewimble.txt">whitepaper
    </a>in July 2016.</p><p>Named after the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Tongue-Tying_Curse">tongue-tying
    curse from the Harry Potter series</a>, its aim is to remove transactions entirely
    from blocks. Under MimbleWimble, transactions consist of nothing but input amounts,
    output amounts, and a signature. The signature of the transaction can only be
    decrypted by the receiver, and so transaction verification is left to the receiver.</p><p>By
    extension, blocks consist of only the list of all transaction input amounts of
    all transactions, all transaction output amounts, and their corresponding signatures.
    Blocks can then be merged seamlessly with previous blocks as they’re nothing but
    pairs of input and output amounts. Nodes then have the ability to cryptographically
    ensure that transactions in blocks do not create extra bitcoins (i.e. their net
    difference between inputs and outputs in blocks is 0) without having to decrypt
    transactions.</p><p>This removal of transaction storage grants complete anonymity
    to all users by stripping away the ability to generate transaction history. Furthermore,
    with blocks only containing the <strong>unspent transaction outputs (</strong>meaning
    the number of Bitcoins that have been received in an address but not moved out
    yet), the blockchain size can be reduced by over 60% according to the whitepaper.
    This reduction in size means that in order to validate a MimbleWimble blockchain,
    nodes will only need to look at the set of unspent transaction outputs instead
    of the entire set of transactions, which will exponentially increase performance.</p><p>The
    mathematical details of MimbleWimble are outside of the scope of this article,
    but are explained in detail in the <a href="https://scalingbitcoin.org/papers/mimblewimble.txt">whitepaper</a>.
    Although MimbleWimble presents some clear advantages and technical breakthroughs,
    its implementation requires the removal of Bitcoin’s Script system that much of
    the existing architecture relies on. As a result, MimbleWimble’s implementation
    on the Bitcoin blockchain is not technically feasible.</p><p>However, there are
    proposals for MimbleWimble to exist as a *<em>sidechain. *</em>A sidechain is
    a separate blockchain directly attached to the Bitcoin blockchain through the
    use of a two-way peg. This peg enables assets between the two chains to be exchanged
    and “pegs” the value of the sidechain asset to the value of Bitcoin. In this setup,
    users would be able to exchange Bitcoins for MimbleWimble coins, conduct completely
    private and rapid transactions on the MimbleWimble chain, and then exchange their
    MimbleWimble coins for Bitcoin whenever they please.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*shjdJcexgSIUXttC.png"

    coins are pegged to the Bitcoin blockchain, operating alongside it with a fixed
    exchange rate, source: <a href="http://blockchain.com">Blockchain.com</a></em></p><p>In
    fact, a group of developers are already in the process of developing MimbleWimble
    as a separate cryptocurrency called <a href="https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin">GRIN</a>;
    it was recently deployed on a test network and may be launched in the near future.</p><h2><strong>Rootstock</strong></h2><p><a

    the less talked about advancements in Bitcoin technology but is by far one of
    the coolest. Rootstock is described as “the first open-source smart contract platform
    with a 2-way peg to Bitcoin that also rewards the Bitcoin miners via merge-mining,
    allowing them to actively participate in the Smart Contract revolution.”</p><p>Much
    like MimbleWimble, Rootstock is being developed as a sidechain solution to the
    Bitcoin blockchain. Its fundamental value lies in its focus in smart contracts.
    Rootstock aims to be a <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_complete">Turing
    Complete</a> (completely programmable) smart-contracts platform that will be backwards
    compatible with Ethereum’s virtual machine. This means that Rootstock will be
    able to execute any smart contracts developed for the Ethereum platform and have
    smart contracts developed for its own platform.</p><p>Rootstock aims to implement
    this versatile smart-contract functionality all while leveraging Bitcoin’s comparatively
    dominant userbase and value by acting as a two-way pegged sidechain. It is also
    being designed to be secured by the existing Bitcoin mining network, therefore
    not needing to incentivize miners to secure its own blockchain. Rootstock also
    aims to tackle the transaction scalability problem by implementing its own version
    of a multi-layered solution called <a href="https://uploads.strikinglycdn.com/files/9dcb08c5-f5a9-430e-b7ba-6c35550a4e67/LuminoTransactionCompressionProtocolLTCP.pdf">Lumino</a>.
    With this, it may be able to accomplish up to 20,000 transactions per second.</p><p>Rootstock
    is aiming for <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-startup-rsk-launch-smart-contracts-sidechain-2017/">a

    alongside Bitcoin and if its claims hold true, it will undoubtedly bring unprecedented
    utility to the Bitcoin network.</p><p>If you’ve gotten this far, congratulations!
    I hope you were able to learn something about the future of Bitcoin and are as

  :title: Marketing To New Micro-Cultures Difficult As Web Grows
  :content: '<p>Marketing To New Micro-Cultures Difficult As Web Grows</p><h3>As the
    breadth of new subculture segments increases, <a href="https://goo.gl/ey72rU">marketing</a>
    to these communities is becoming harder to scale.</h3><p>Who remembers these movies?
    North Shore, where a lonely Arizonan breaks into the radical pro surfing culture
    on Oahu. Rad, where a persistent BMX rider is determined to take on the Helltrack
    despite many obstacles. Donnie Brasco, where an undercover agent infiltrates the
    mafia. These movies all provide a realistic analogy of the inclusive exclusivity
    of micro-cultures.</p><p>If we go back 60 years, our marketing segments were much
    more homogenized and binary, in the sense of cool|not-cool, athlete|nerd, pretty|average,
    good|evil, smoker|non-smoker, clean|dirty, homemaker|breadwinner, man|woman, sweater|jacket,
    ketchup|mustard, red|menthol. These more binary social/cultural constructions
    also led to easier segmentation of customers into larger ‘buckets.’ Marginal interest
    groups were marketed to on back pages and local newsprint at best.</p><p><img

    Alcoa Aluminum ad"><em>Sexist Alcoa Aluminum ad</em></p><p>Internet culture has
    changed everything. We’re seeing thousands of micro-communities emerge as positive,
    creative and inclusive respites for a new tide of special interests. This is creating
    an incredible breadth of community content to market against. As their breadth
    continues to increase, micro-cultures also remain nuanced and exclusive, creating
    new challenges for marketers.</p><p>In his 1996 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cultures-Internet-Virtual-Spaces-Histories/dp/0803975198/">*Cultures
    of the Internet: Virtual Spaces, Real Histories, Living Bodies</a>*, Professor
    Robert Shields and some of his contemporaries explored the ideas of Internet sub-cultures
    very early on. 19 years ago Professor Shields wrote:</p><blockquote><p>New discursive
    norms are being invented and disseminated on the Internet and from there ‘infect’
    the design, layout and textual strategies of advertising, literary works and research
    reports.[…]It is essential to treat computer-mediated communication as a process
    involving differentiated ‘bodies.’ The tendency has been to treat all users as
    alike according to a stereotype of young, socially inept and thus culturally marginalized
    male ‘computer addicts.’</p></blockquote><p>Professor Shields’ notes underscore
    the importance of this rapidly growing space of Internet culture and the general
    misunderstanding of it’s cultural phenomena, which have taken on great importance
    in the consciousness of young people.</p><p>These new communities are not unlike
    the punk music, skateboarding and surfing communities of the 80s and 90s. Marketers
    have always required an authentic connection to touch and influence these groups.
    Any communications that were outside of what the community considered authentic
    would be quickly deflected and/or ostracized. Consider the success of Reddit and
    it’s hyper-moderated list groups. These function in just the same way.</p><p><img

    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*mb0UWKWMQCS4wZuRmsO_Eg.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>With
    new micro-cultures emerging around interests like pizza, cats, memes, yoga, crossfit,
    footwear, crafts, wellness, normcore, fit goth, seapunk, furries, otherkin, survival,
    webcams, fan fiction, and many more, marginalized obscurity is the new ‘normal.’</p><p>Few
    people talk about why the majority of online companies, particularly e-commerce
    and non-platform SaaS, are so hard to scale. Many have raised $100M dollars, yet
    struggle to turn a profit as online customers are harder to find, isolate and
    impress. It is becoming more difficult for our online ad units to create an authentic
    connection with viewers because their online interests are becoming hyper-nuanced
    and continually informed by a new real-time culture, i.e. a finitely engaged and
    fundamentally distracted Internet culture. Cultural fragmentation away from the
    status quo continues at an accelerated pace.</p><h2>E-pollution is out of control.</h2><p>And
    so, we take this rapidly expanding Internet culture space, with all of its nuance,
    breadth and complexity, and we layer on top of it the most vile, often unmentioned
    cancer on the web: Bots.</p><p>According to a study by Incapsula, <a href="https://www.incapsula.com/blog/bot-traffic-report-2014.html">over
    50% of current web traffic could be different forms of fraudulent ‘bot’ traffic</a>.
    According to the Wall Street Journal, over <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304026304579453253860786362">30%
    of our paid advertising clicks could also be from fraudulent bots</a>. This is
    scary stuff and applicable to every class of online ad: video, search, affiliate,
    streaming, display. During my time building data warehouses and analytics products,
    I can say that these reports are completely consistent with what I’ve seen in
    the real world.</p><h2>Authenticity as the only currency moving forward.</h2><p>With
    all of the cultural fragmentation and low-quality traffic, we have to take a much
    closer look at brand narrative and content.</p><blockquote><h1>How do we speak
    to all of these micro-cultures instead of just describing them as attributes in
    a database of millions? Authenticity of brand communication and narrative has
    never been more important. Sincere connection will be the future currency of marketing
    products online. [<a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=%22Sincere%20connection%20will%20be%20the%20future%20of%20marketing%20products%20online.%22%20via%20@wbelk%20https://medium.com/@wbelk/marketing-to-new-micro-cultures-difficult-as-web-grows-863fa64e932e">Tweet
    this</a>]</h1></blockquote><p>The allure of web-scale often distracts our brands
    from a truly unique identity and narrative. Even more troubling for marketers,
    we find that micro-community influencers like <a href="http://iamgalla.com/">Adam
    Gallagher</a>, <a href="https://about.me/veronica">Veronica Belmont</a>, <a href="http://www.gregoryhan.com/">Gregory
    Han</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/ijustine/">Justine Ezarik</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/c_kimber/">Christian
    Kimber</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/ANNAKALINOWSKA">Annaka Linowska</a>,
    <a href="https://instagram.com/AQOFFICIAL">Abdulqadir</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/dirtbagdarling/">Johnie
    Gall</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/guerreisms/">Karl-Edwin Guerre</a>, and
    <a href="https://instagram.com/tomemrich/">Tom Emrich</a> have become the new
    narrators of ‘cool.’ It is becoming much more difficult for brands to compete
    with content that commodifies brands and champions unique community-driven narratives.</p><h2>Authenticity
    is not the same as personalization.</h2><p>Knowing if I’m male or female, or knowing
    that my zip code is 90254, is not the same as marketing to my <em>culture</em>.
    Cultural connection requires authenticity and knowledge of a nuanced complexity
    of language, semantics, tone and color. Often this is ‘tribal’ information, changing
    organically with the community.</p><p>A great example of authentic micro-culture
    marketing with larger mass influence is <a href="http://www.polerstuff.com/">Poler
    Outdoor Stuff</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw7qwAi7duc">Benji
    Wagner</a>, Founder and Creative Director explains, “Poler is meant to inspire
    people to reconnect with the outdoors in simple everyday ways that are meaningful
    to them. Because of this, we’ve seen great support across different culture segments
    like outdoor exploration, hiking, car camping, skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing
    and dirtbiking. Also, because of our unique content and storytelling, Poler has
    really been embraced by a spectrum of influencers, artists and content creators.”</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*i7ryXKatN-EhUCRkPgbFvw.jpeg" alt="[Poler
    Outdoor Stuff, Portland, OR flagship display](http://www.polerstuff.com)"><em><a
    href="http://www.polerstuff.com">Poler Outdoor Stuff, Portland, OR flagship display</a></em></p><p>The
    wider the scope of our online marketing programs, the more our content needs to
    be customized to meet the cultural expectations of each visitor. This goes far
    beyond just contextual and personalized customization. This will be the big challenge
    for brands in the next decade.</p><p>The future may dictate that each new customer
    segment require an entirely new narrative and marketing strategy. Some of our
    tech-focused CRM companies are just scratching the surface of this new reality,
    companies like <a href="http://www.sailthru.com/">SailThru</a>, <a href="http://www.retentionscience.com/">Retention
    Science</a>, <a href="http://www.afty.co/">Afinity</a>, <a href="https://www.custora.com/">Custora</a>,
    <a href="http://www.richrelevance.com/">RichRelevance</a>.</p><h2>The honesty
    of scale.</h2><p>In order to grow sustainably, we need to be honest about the
    potential scale of our products. For example, e-commerce brands sometimes confuse
    themselves with platforms, anticipating unrealistic organic growth.</p><p>Some
    of our products seem to sell themselves, either from brilliant design execution
    or broad platform dynamics. The last decade has clearly shown us that content
    communities and platforms matter. If a company can combine revenue generation
    with platform dynamics, the possibilities are great. In this case, micro-communities
    can adopt, self-select and enforce their cultures on each platform while driving
    incremental revenue in specialized segments. We have seen this with companies
    like Slack, VBulletin, IFTTT, Salesforce, Heroku, Shopify, Magento, Pinterest
    and more.</p><p>The reality of Internet marketing for a non-platform product is
    brutal. If we are paying $1 per click for qualified traffic and 2% of our new
    visitors make a purchase, that means it costs us $100 per hundred people and we
    get two purchasers. If we sell our product for $40, we might make $15 in <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/saarsaar/why-most-startups-fail-at-acquiring-new-customers-and-how-you-can-succeed/21">gross
    margin</a> (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/saarsaar/why-most-startups-fail-at-acquiring-new-customers-and-how-you-can-succeed">link
    to great slide deck</a>). So we’ve made $30 for our two purchases and spent $100,
    which leaves us with a <strong>$70 loss</strong>. Let’s say our LTV is $120 (or
    three purchases), that would be six purchases across the lifetime of our two new
    customers, which would result in $90 in gross margin. We still end up with a <strong>$10
    loss</strong> over the lifetime of these new customers for our $100 spent on clicks.</p><p>Because
    our current content production model cannot keep up with the pace of micro-community
    growth, it might cost $100,000 of these ads to find $10k of sustainably reproducible
    traffic. Need more scale, $10M to find $1M of reproducible traffic, and so on.</p><p>“Micro-testing
    campaigns with authentic content is so important,” says Dirk McGregor, VP of Customer
    Acquisition at Regent Equity Partners, whose portfolio companies generate over
    $300M in revenue. “I think what we’re seeing on the larger market are companies
    scaling too wide with their standard ad campaigns from day one. They sadly end
    up losing a substantial piece of that investment without first considering the
    rising tide of low-quality traffic on today’s networks. Without a disciplined
    approach, it’s tough to find the quick scale people often expect.”</p><h2>How
    do we scale in this new era?</h2><p>Given our new reality, we not only need to
    focus on authentic content and narrative, but we also need to limit our financial
    risk when testing new audiences. While more traditional growth initiatives like
    email marketing, affiliate marketing, physical events, and traditional lead-generation
    have a much lower risk profile, they do not scale as quickly as display advertising
    (which is growing to include internet radio, video and various new social ad units).</p><p>Just
    like using <a href="http://rocketfueledprocess.com/">Lean methodologies for product
    development</a>, we can also apply these core ideas to scale our marketing initiatives.
    We want to reduce our risk profile, or batch size, as much as possible in order
    to test our hypotheses, i.e. spend less, learn more. We can achieve this with
    disciplined hypothesis testing for new audience segments.</p><p>Something like
    this is a good start:</p><ul><li><p>Construct our new audience hypothesis, i.e.
    develop narrative, content, ads and communication strategy for our new audience.</p></li><li><p>Micro-test
    our hypothesis, i.e. run ads, emails, social.</p></li><li><p>Include A/B/C/D testing
    wherever possible.</p></li><li><p><strong>Set a tight limit to our initial spend.</strong></p></li><li><p>Review
    our data.</p></li><li><p>Clean our traffic sources, i.e. block fraudulent and/or
    non-performing sources.</p></li><li><p>Adjust our strategy.</p></li><li><p>Repeat.</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*LBOM9hd5L4qBF_5qZKEdCA.png" alt=""></p><h2>Programmatic
    buying can provide efficient, larger scale.</h2><p>If we take the Lean approach,
    we increase our chances for success and remove a large amount of waste/risk from
    our advertising machine. If we can combine this methodology with real tech and
    significant resources for <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/cmo-s-guide-programmatic-buying/293257/">programmatic
    buying</a>, content production and targeting across large ad networks, we have
    a much better chance for sustainable scale. When we talk about this, we are saying
    that we can automate our audience segment testing and analysis, including partial
    automation of content production. Obviously this is no small task.</p><p>Many
    search companies have proven this model, companies like Culture Machine, TubeMogul,
    26.2 Media Agency, Dex Media, CampusExplorer, YP.com, Rubicon, <strong>[ more
    research on this, these are probably no longer relevant… ]</strong></p><h2>Content
    production must adapt to a large number of customer segments.</h2><p>As we successfully
    test our audience segments and develop new narratives, authentic content production
    will become a large cost center. We see companies like <a href="https://tongal.com/">Tongal</a>,
    <a href="http://kapost.com/">Kapost</a>, <a href="http://www.marketo.com/">Marketo</a>,
    <a href="http://www.infusionsoft.com/">Infusionsoft</a>, and <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/">Hubspot</a>
    creating efficiencies in the content lifecycle. Can we merge cultural understanding
    with authentic content production at scale?</p><h2>Enter the ‘Culture Manager.’</h2><p>As
    a general rule, founding level employees build the first culture narrative for
    a product or service. What about the next audience segment? What if there are
    1,000s of these audience segments?</p><blockquote><h1>It’s a scary idea that as
    conversion rates drop and Internet pollution increases by orders of magnitude,
    we might need experts for each micro-culture to create a narrative effective enough
    to break through the noise.</h1></blockquote><p>Who is this person? Is this a
    new position entirely? I think it might be. This person is almost an Internet
    anthropologist, in charge of understanding several important micro-cultures.</p><p>Jason
    Provisor, Head of Marketing Strategy at <a href="https://tongal.com/">Tongal</a>,
    expands on this idea: “Many of the companies we work with are too close to their
    own brands. It’s the age of the consumer. You no longer tell, you ask. At Tongal
    we’ve built a platform that crowdsources insights from within important micro-cultures
    to drive marketing content production. It’s no longer about creating ads, but
    creating narratives that resonate with each community.”</p><p>Our primary paradigm
    in the ‘lean startup’ era is to just follow the data; test everything, measure
    everything and respond to the data. Unfortunately this is not going to help much
    if our marketers or product developers are completely detached from the micro-cultures
    they are meant to serve. If we use the example of the skateboarding and surfing
    communities, imagine a fresh Ivy League MBA who grew up playing competitive chess
    and doubles badminton trying to ‘learn’ his way into marketing to these communities,
    it would be a massacre.</p><h2>Open our coats and compress our learnings.</h2><p>Much
    of what we’re seeing is the confluence of a new breadth of Internet micro-cultures
    and the new reality of Internet ad performance. In many ways, we have been collectively
    floating down a widening river into a vast ocean of marketing inefficiencies,
    a black hole of phantom clicks and ad narrative lost in translation.</p><p>Surely
    there is no single formula to combat our new reality. Risk mitigation is generally
    my number one priority. While it’s easy and fun to spend VC money and corporate
    display budgets on underperforming ads, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/marc-andreessen-on-startup-burn-rates-worry-2014-9">perhaps
    that’s more a sign of the times than a long-term strategy</a>. An honest and introspective
    approach to building new products and authentic culture narratives, together with
    lean testing of new audience segments will be essential in the coming years.</p><p><img

  :title: Regenerative cultures are about thriving together
  :content: '<p>You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change
    something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.</p><blockquote><h1>—
    R. Buckminster Fuller</h1><h1>[…] the ones who are crazy enough to think that
    they can change the world, are the ones who do.</h1><h1>— Steve Jobs</h1></blockquote><p>In
    the end it comes down to asking ourselves: will we continue to strive to out-compete
    each other and in the process unravel the thread that all life depends upon? Or
    will we learn to collaborate in the healing of the whole through transformative
    innovation and regenerative design creating vibrant cultures and thriving communities
    for all?</p><p>In early 2010, my friend Samantha Sweetwater, an evolutionary activist
    in the Bay Area of San Francisco, invited me to contribute to an experiment in
    co-creation. Jean Russell had the inspiration to start a collective inquiry into
    the meaning of a word with transformative agency: *Thriving. *“What does thrivability
    mean to you?” Around this question Jean curated the co-creation of *Thrivability
    — A Collaborative Sketch. *Seventy of us from all walks of life and a diversity
    of places were invited to write a short reflection on the meaning of 60 words
    and phrases that relate like a broad map to this magnetic notion. “In the dance
    between the individual and humanity as a whole, there is an aliveness. In aliveness,
    there is a yearning for thriving”, writes Jean in the introduction. “All living
    things strive to move beyond survival to truly flourish.” A simple yet magnetic
    idea galvanized our enthusiasm and contributions: “that the goal of evolving our
    behavior should be to thrive” (Russell, 2010: 6), both individually *and *collectively.</p><p>I
    encourage you to look at the kaleidoscopic collage of meaning that emerged. As
    Jean had intended, it was a starting point for a wider conversation and inquiry.
    In her subsequent book, <em>Thrivability — Breaking Through to a World that Works</em>,
    Jean asks the question: “What would our lives and the sum of our society be like
    if we said they were thriving?” She describes how we can move from “breakdown
    thinking” to “breakthrough thinking” by inquiring into the way we see (perceive
    the world), understand ourselves, and can take effective transformative actions
    to co-create a thriving world (Russell, 2013). My contribution to the ‘collaborative
    sketch was on ‘integrity.’ I found myself inspired to write:</p><blockquote><h1>Integrity
    is all about wholeness. […] Integrity is about living in congruence with the insight
    that as co-creative participants in the world we live in, we can all contribute
    to the transition towards a sustaining, resilient and thriving culture, moving
    from the mess we are in, beyond sustainability, to the thrivability of the whole
    community of life.</h1><h1>Daniel Wahl in Russell (2010: 15)</h1></blockquote><p>The
    short answer to why we should aim to create regenerative cultures together is
    simple: choosing the path of regeneration and cooperation will create a greater
    level of wellbeing, health, happiness and equality for everyone and all life;
    *and *in the process of co-creating a better future together, our lives will be
    more meaningful, fulfilling, creative and fun.</p><p>For too long the narrative
    of separation has conditioned us to the knee-jerk response of competition in the
    face of perceived scarcity. Local and global collaboration in the co- creation
    of regenerative communities, enterprises, economies and cultures can unlock a
    very different future for humanity. Collaboration in regenerative practices can
    change our experience of reality: turning a resource-constrained planet on a path
    to ecological collapse into a thriving patchwork of socio-ecological systems generating
    an abundance of renewable resources, restoring vital ecosystems functions, nurturing
    solidarity, community cohesion and resilience, while effectively mitigating —
    and adapting to — climate change.</p><p>The creation of regenerative cultures
    is also rooted in a shift from seeing ourselves only as separate individuals,
    communities, nations and species to understanding our deep interbeing as fundamentally
    interconnected expressions of life itself. By shifting to a relational perspective
    and paying attention to the ways that life creates conditions conducive to life,
    both the need for *and *promise of regenerative cultures become apparent.</p><p>As
    we recognize ourselves as participants in the evolution of life and consciousness,
    we come to understand ourselves as creative expressions of natural process. The
    path of exploitation leads via increasing separation, disintegration and competition
    to the early demise of our relatively young species. The path of regeneration
    through conscious interbeing, integration and collaboration opens up the possibility
    of a thriving future for humanity as a mature member in the community of life.
    If we choose to, we can generate abundance for all by consciously creating conditions
    conducive to life. Let us ask:</p><p><strong>What if we choose regeneration over
    exploitation?</strong></p><p><strong>What if we choose to thrive together, rather
    than compete against?</strong></p><p>The future potential of these transition
    times invites us to explore in community how we can co-create diverse regenerative
    cultures with sensitivity to place and scale. Global-local collaboration, based
    on knowledge and technology exchange, can help us to value diversity in the process
    of creating increased self-reliance and redundancies at multiple scales. Transformative
    innovation applied to redesigning the human presence on Earth requires global
    cooperation in the process of building circular and regionally focused economies
    in support of resilient communities and the regeneration of their ecosystems.
    Thriving regional economies, supported by scale-linking collaboration and global
    solidarity, are the basis for collaborative abundance for all.</p><p>We can all
    start cultural transformation and seed regenerative patterns simply by asking
    the kind of questions explored in this book and inviting others around us to explore
    them with us. Questions can initiate conversations that will lead us to re-examine
    the relationship between nature and culture. In these conversations, we can learn
    to value the importance of whole-systems health and help each other to understand
    our interdependence.</p><p>A relational perspective of interbeing makes the objectives
    ahead seem quite clear: create conditions where all life can thrive by nurturing
    the health of communities and ecosystems functions everywhere. Sustainability
    is not enough. We need to do more than just sustain. We need to regenerate the
    vitality and bioproductivity of the planetary life support system. We need to
    nurture and regenerate the pattern of socio- ecological interdependencies that
    support human and planetary health. It is this pattern of health that allows us
    to stay responsive, adaptable and resilient in the face of change (see Chapter
    4).</p><p>To improve the regenerative capacity of communities and ecosystems we
    need to pay close attention to the effect of our actions at multiple interconnected
    scales, developing a participatory, living-systems perspective. We also need to
    develop future consciousness that can guide wise action in the face of an unpredictable
    future and humble recognition of the limits of our knowledge and capabilities
    (see Chapter 2). This includes processes that help us decide more wisely which
    technologies to employ at what scale and in which place. Not all that is technologically
    possible creates conditions conducive to life.</p><p>The socio-cultural transition
    ahead will require a move towards participatory democracy which depends on a widespread
    culture of learning and radical responsibility. Co-production of vital community
    services can help to ensure that life-long learning enabled by ongoing, community-focused
    design conversations will also inform participatory governance. An ‘Open source
    everything’ approach would enable learning to take place throughout the whole
    system (rapidly) and offer vital decision support, education and technological
    capability to *all *of humanity.</p><p>Education for ecological and social literacy
    will play an important role in spreading the understanding that we are participants
    in a fundamentally interconnected physical, chemical, biological, ecological,
    social and psychological process. By living the questions together we can begin
    to educate each other in our communities and businesses about how to participate
    appropriately in this process — and nurture our capacity to access collective
    intelligence and wisdom. Since we cannot predict with certainty what kind of disruptions
    and unforeseen consequences of our actions might challenge us in the future, the
    best preparatory action is to create resilient communities at multiple scales
    networked for mutual support. This will create the basis for widespread collaboration
    as a path to increased wellbeing and meaning, solidarity and social cohesion,
    healthier ecosystems, more vibrant local economies and, thus, to thriving communities.</p><p>We
    have to re-invent education as a process that inspires everyone — regardless of
    their age — to keep on exploring the kind of questions asked in this book and
    adapt them to the unique conditions of a particular culture and place. In the
    ‘age of information’, education is about learning to ask the right questions rather
    than memorizing pre-formulated answers and temporary solutions. By asking the
    right questions we can gain a deeper understanding of systems structures and dynamics,
    and we can work towards synthesis and integration, learning to optimize the system
    as a whole.</p><p>We are drowning in information and choking on ‘big data’. Our
    knowledge is compartmentalized and locked into silos protected by jargon and isolated
    communities of specialized knowledge. We long for synthesis and integration. We
    are starving for wisdom and thirsting for meaning. The role of education in cultures
    with advanced telecommunication and data processing technologies is not so much
    about memorizing information and accumulating knowledge. Education in the 21st
    century is about nurturing a general social and ecological literacy along with
    the capacity to collaborate in the process of asking the right questions that
    will guide wise action informed by future consciousness *and *readily available
    big data and factual knowledge.</p><p>Working together to find the appropriate
    questions is a more effective cultural guidance system towards a regenerative
    future than forcing one-size-fits-all solutions. We can unleash the culturally
    transformative power of collective intelligence by forming local, regional and
    global communities of practice that live the questions together. These communities
    offer the context for life-long learning and formal and informal education. To
    skill-up the transition we need design thinking, future consciousness and an understanding
    of the living systems view of life to be woven through curricula from pre- school
    to university and beyond to life-long learning opportunities for all.</p><p>Regenerative
    design, including education as regenerative meta-design driving worldview and
    culture change, can drastically reduce and reverse the negative human impact on
    the planetary life support system. Eco-social resilience and health can be restored
    at a local, regional and global scale. Global collaboration, based on open knowledge
    and technology exchange, can unite local and regional regeneration projects into
    a worldwide and systemic response to climate change and the converging crises
    we face.</p><p>Biologically and ecologically inspired design and innovation offer
    an opportunity to root regenerative cultures in the ground of 3.8 billion years
    of life’s intelligence and ingenuity. The creative challenge of redesigning our
    material culture, our systems of production and consumption, our life-styles and
    economic systems, offers countless opportunities for transformative innovation
    and design for regenerative cultures. In weaving the multiple opportunities for
    synergy and symbiosis into cooperatively integrated mosaics of diverse regenerative
    eco-social systems we *are *designing *as *nature.</p><p>As we explored in Chapter
    6, pioneers in green chemistry and material science, bio- inspired technologies,
    product design, architecture, industrial ecology, and community, urban and regional
    planning are already living the questions of regenerative design inspired by life’s
    principles. They are actively engaging with the most important and meaningful
    creative challenge of the 21st century.</p><p><strong>How do we design for the
    emergence of regenerative cultures everywhere?</strong></p><p><strong>How do we
    co-create health, wellbeing and happiness in thriving communities?</strong></p><p><strong>How
    do we nurture human and planetary health by redesigning the human presence on
    Earth?</strong></p><p>Pathfinders on our collective pilgrimage are already applying
    ecosystem mimicry to the creation of regenerative business ecologies, new financial
    and economic systems, as well as ecosystems restoration and regenerative agriculture.
    All of these communities of practice are now forming networks of active change
    agents (evolutionary activists) who are beginning to link up across scales and
    disciplines (see Chapter 7).</p><p>Social innovation, peer-to-peer collaboration,
    open knowledge and technology, the spread of maker culture, additive manufacturing,
    circular economy initiatives and diverse online and off-line community networks
    are all powerful enablers and catalysts in the creation of collaborative and regenerative
    systems structures that will nurture regenerative cultures. In many places and
    cultures, people are already living the questions together and transforming the
    world one place at a time. Another world is possible. If we pay attention, we
    can already see this world taking shape all around us.</p><p>Collectively envisioning
    a regenerative future and design conversations at the community scale about how
    to implement these visions *are *powerful processes of cultural transformation.
    Conversations like these are beginning to take place everywhere, in community
    groups, boardrooms, town halls, universities, government think tanks and within
    the UN system. Together — *as one humanity *— we are capable of responding to
    the converging crises and offering culturally transformative responses to them.
    By forming networks of collaboration we can begin to heal divisive ideologies
    and old habits of competition driven by the outdated narrative of separation.</p><p>Only
    seeing separation and therefore competition, rather than also seeing the underlying
    wholeness of our interbeing with all life, has caused a cultural myopia that created
    many of these crises in the first place. Now, we are beginning to see the relationships
    of our ‘belonging-together’ rather than seeing only isolated individuals and objects.
    We are overcoming modernity’s ‘crisis of perception’. The future possibility of
    thriving communities and ecosystems providing a better life for *all of *humanity
    is within our reach if enough of us commit to creating such a future together.</p><p>New
    models that make the existing ones obsolete are already taking shape. Transformative
    innovation and regenerative design act like viruses of infectious health, nurturing
    regenerative cultures everywhere. Our species can take the path to becoming a
    restorative and regenerative presence on Earth. Caring for Earth *is *caring for
    ourselves and our community. We can collaboratively create abundance in thriving
    communities intimately and elegantly adapted to the uniqueness of place.</p><p>Art,
    music, poetry, dance, story and the sciences celebrate the process of life. Through
    them, we can celebrate our diversity in the unity of interconnection and joyous
    cooperation.</p><p>By asking appropriate questions we can respond wisely to change,
    knowing when to persist, when to adapt and when to fundamentally transform. We
    can learn to appreciate disturbance and breakdown as an enabling constraint and
    a design opportunity for systemic transformation and breakthrough.</p><p>The very
    act of living the questions together is a ‘presence-ing’ of the future in the
    now. It cultivates the practice of asking ‘what if’ to unlock creative opportunities
    and inform future consciousness. Deep collective inquiry and design conversations
    facilitate transformative innovation in the second horizon (H2+ innovation) which
    seeds the future of H3 regenerative cultures in the present moment and, if successful,
    creates pockets of the future in the present with culturally transformative effect.</p><p>Together
    we can design for positive emergence and whole-systems health. Systemic thinking
    and nurturing future consciousness through the Three Horizons framework can help
    us to make wiser choices as we evaluate disruptive innovation and identify the
    kind of transformative innovation and design that will help us to co-create regenerative
    cultures. The third horizon is already here, just unevenly distributed.</p><p>Let’s
    spread greater wellbeing, thriving community life, deeper meaning, cooperation
    and solidarity outwards from the already existing ‘outbreaks of infectious health’
    in business, governance and civil society around the world. Let’s continue to
    reconnect to our profound interbeing with each other and the community of life.
    Let’s continue to regenerate healthy ecosystems functions and planetary health.
    Let’s continue to co-create the regenerative communities, enterprises, economies
    and cultures we want to see in the world. Let’s continue to live the questions
    together.</p><p>We are relational beings who come from cooperation, are cooperation,
    and can choose to co-create a thriving and regenerative future through cooperation.
    As beings who are blessed with the miraculous gift of a self-reflective consciousness,
    our greatest challenge and our greatest opportunity is not to *know *the meaning
    of life, but to *live *a life of meaning. That is why humanity is worth sustaining.</p><p>*As
    *life, *as *nature, *as *consciousness, *as *universe we can bring forth a world
    in which humanity, like the rest of life, creates conditions conducive to life.
    Living the questions together is the practice of doing so responsively and responsibly,
    using our human capacities for collective intelligence, foresight and vision to
    get clear about our collective intentions and to design and co-create the regenerative
    communities we want to live in.</p><p>Living the questions is an opportunity to
    connect, to yourself, to your community, to your world. By living the questions
    together, rather than obsessing with definitive answers and permanent solutions,
    we can give up the futile attempt to *know *our path into the future. We can move
    from prediction and control to aiming for appropriate participation.</p><p>As
    humble pilgrims and apprentices of life, we can begin to *live *our way into an
    uncertain yet potentially thriving future. I am confident that increasing collaboration
    will unleash newfound creativity and innovation that will shape the transition
    towards regenerative cultures and thriving communities.</p><p>Intellectually,
    this seems the only viable way through the eye of the needle. Emotionally, it
    gives me meaning and nourishes me. Intuitively, it feels right and has opened
    up a path full of synchronicity. Somatically, it gives me an embodied experience
    of *belonging *to many communities, to life, and to an animate and intimate Earth.
    Spiritually, my interbeing with life’s continuous exploration of novelty and the
    evolution of consciousness has simultaneously taken away my fear of death and
    increased my love for life.</p><p>The intention to act as a cultural creative,
    a transition designer and an evolutionary activist in the co-creation of regenerative
    cultures is something that deeply informs my being and my doing. I am excited
    about the times ahead. Despite all that is still ‘wrong’ in the world, I am confident
    that we are capable of co-creating regenerative cultures everywhere. What about
    you?</p><blockquote><h1><strong>What did you do once you knew?</strong></h1><h1>What

    and combined into a single flow.</p><p>*<em>Conflict day \U0001F92F: *</em>Also
    one cool thing we did is we printed all of our wireframes and started marking

    we have so many conflicts, we fight the whole day. Then from next day everyone
    had a clear vision on what we have to do</p><blockquote><h1>“If there is no conflict,
    you are compromising the design. If there is compromise it will lead to bad design.”</h1></blockquote><p>None
    of my team mates want to compromise on the quality of output, so overall this
    phase is super helpful for us to get the right direction</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2516/1*zLsa2ddPtVpGtUxAfa4nuA.png\"

    alt=\"\"></p><h3>Mood-board.</h3><p>Since all of are designer the problem is everyone
    like certain colors, So we decided not get biased. We created a Pintertest borard
    to collect all our mood board of food, food books.</p><blockquote><h1>Don’t take

    alt=\"\"></p><h3>Brand Identity</h3><p>As I said before for our overall branding
    we inclined more towards the real inspiration for logo inspiration</p><blockquote><h1>We

    alt=\"\"></p><h2>UI Design Phase</h2><p>Then we brought the same coloring and
    stying to our app</p><h3>Home screen:</h3><p>Each of us come up with own come
    screen version with same branding and we used slack poll to select one. Also we
    tested with some users</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5354/1*7kCfw4qi5L0WqRM0G02ifA.png\"

    alt=\"\"></p><h3>Passport</h3><p>We thought of some gamification and physical
    touch to our app so we thought of bringing a Passport analogy to our app</p><p>The
    Melting Pot ‘Passport’ allows users to keep recipes and photos from past experiences.
    Users can reflect on good memories, access new recipes and gain ‘customs stamps’
    for each country in which they’ve had cooking experience.</p><p>This Gamifies
    the experience and encourages users to explore and collect more cooking journeys
    from new places.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4460/1*O4RtWgfEFmx1QKi_SJIaJg.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><h2>Prototypes</h2><h3>Bringing everyone together</h3><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*SnSeKfRDBVdcTHUuj4kbyA.gif\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>The overall vision of Melting pot is bring all human together
    in a single place which will eventually lead to a happy world without discrimination.</p><p>When
    the user onboarding itself we show them a aniamtion which represent, people from
    different places comming to signle place.</p><h3>GIF BROWSING</h3><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*KMleK8Jvn3bvFJG6mcj9CQ.gif\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>During our user testing, we found that current apps don’t tell
    the story of a rich experience.</p><p>GIF browsing creates dynamic content for
    the user that focuses on the experience of cooking and sharing rather than just
    the end beautiful photo.</p><p>We wanted to bring people into the homes of the
    chefs and the true feel of cooking and sharing. To bring those pictures to life,
    we utilized GIFs, allowing the chef to personalize their offering further, taking
    some of the pressure off of having the perfect food photo.</p><h3>FOLLOWING</h3><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*aJ24qJEDAz2Frxml0mrKfQ.gif\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>We realized that while we want to help users expand their cultural
    boundaries, they would have favorites. So we added an option to follow favorite
    chefs. This means that their information will show up in the “spotlight” tab of
    the home screen, showing users any new recipes they have, first. This also helped
    to solve the issue of popular chefs running out of seats with no way easy to check
    in on and follow them.</p><h3>JOURNEY POINTS</h3><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*qmP8MdLgImq1Kc4Ekk_lQg.gif\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Journey points came out of a desire to give subtle incentive to
    the user to engage in cooking experiences that are different from their current
    cultural knowledge/background. They can also be used to help bring new users into
    the community. For example users who are new to Melting Pot or at a physical location
    that is farther out of a central location than average could be worth more points.
    When a user hits a certain amount of points, they might receive rewards dollars
    towards another melting pot experience.</p><h3>On the Day of Experience</h3><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Is4NPdHogM9cx5nsN-DHIg.gif\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>On the day of experience you home screen will have a jumping bottom
    sheet, so that you need to search for the option. If you click on that bottom
    card, it will provide two option direction to a place or chatting with a host.</p><h3>Post
    experience: Giving away a cherished recipe</h3><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XaAb24sGqbOBBLICIoaQ3w.gif\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Melting Pot is first and foremost an app to connect people to
    experiences that help them grow together and bond. So when the experience is over,
    there’s a special moment of sharing a recipe. It’s information, but it also represents
    a certain amount of friendship. First a user receives a personal message and with
    that access to a recipe. Within that recipe, users can upload photos from there
    experience and see video tips form the chef.</p><h3>Story</h3><p>We really struggle
    to put everything together in a single 2 min video because of different actor
    and many app screens in between. So we created a shared google doc with each scene
    content ands perfect timing which really help us get the great video.</p><p><img

  :title: Regenerative cultures are rooted in cooperation
  :content: '<p>Regenerative cultures are rooted in cooperation</p><p>We are beginning
    to learn from the way resource, information and energy flows are organized in
    ecosystems. We are learning to apply ecological insights to creating whole-systems
    design solutions that pay close attention to systemic interconnections and the
    potential for systemic synergies (or win-win-win solutions). Biomimicry at the
    ecosystem level, in the form of integrated whole-systems design based on ecological
    understanding, is the most complex and most promising way of applying nature’s
    insights to creating regenerative cultures.</p><p>In mature ecosystems the health
    of the whole system is optimized by creating symbiotic relationships between the
    diversity of species in the system. Cascades and cycles of nutrients, information
    and energy create a diversity of interconnections throughout the system, in such
    a way that one organism’s waste products become another organism’s food, and feedback
    loops regulate temporary stability within a constantly transforming and evolving
    context.</p><p>The community of organisms in an ecosystem — with its diverse roles,
    multiple redundancies and quick feedback loops — is interwoven into networks within
    networks to optimize the health, resilience and adaptability of the system as
    a whole. We have a lot to learn from this pattern of organization. It is the pattern
    that defines regenerative systems capable of self-organization.</p><p>The transition
    towards a regenerative culture requires the redesign of our communities, businesses,
    systems of governance, and how we meet everybody’s basic needs in ways that learn
    from these patterns of organization of ecosystems. In doing so, we have to be
    careful to scrutinize the ways in which we apply our biological and ecological
    knowledge. While we urgently need to apply biologically inspired design and innovation,
    we must first examine the extent to which the ‘story of separation’ (scarcity
    and competition) has also coloured our perspective on life, biology and ecology.</p><p>The
    neo-Darwinian perspective, which still dominates the popular understanding of
    biology, isolates individual organisms or genes from the context of the living
    matrix that sustains them. Scarcity, competition and individual success are seen
    as the main drivers of evolution. This is an outdated perspective, based on outdated
    metaphors like Richard Dawkins’s ‘Selfish Gene’ (1976).</p><p>The reductionist
    focus on genes and isolated individuals does not sufficiently reflect our current
    scientific understanding of how ecosystems and the biosphere maintain health and
    resilience. A more systemic and long-term understanding of how life creates conditions
    conducive to life has led scientists to recognize the vital importance of symbiosis,
    collaboration and systemic optimization in living systems. The maximization of
    efficiency of limited aspects of the system or the (temporary) success of certain
    individuals or species, on which so much of our biological (and economic) story-telling
    has focused, are of secondary importance for long-term survival. Collaboration
    and systemic optimization are more effective survival strategies.</p><p>Ecosystems
    are resilient because they have requisite variety (diversity) and multiple redundancies
    at different scales. The complex networks of relationships that create healthy
    ecosystems cannot be explained effectively by focusing only on the success or
    failure of individuals within them. The interconnections and symbiotic exchanges
    that create health and resilience as emergent properties of complex dynamic systems
    support the vitality of all participants and contribute to the survival of the
    system as a whole. Such health and vitality are emergent properties of the continuously
    transforming networks of information and resource flow across whole systems.</p><p>Think
    of the health and resilience of your own body (as a complex system). Our individual
    health is to a large part maintained by an ecosystem of bacteria and fungi inhabiting
    our intestines, our mouth and our skin. We are walking ecosystems! We carry ten
    times more non-human cells within us (and on us) than we have human cells in our
    bodies (Wenner, 2007). The diversity of life permeates us. Modern biology confirms
    that to be is to <em>interbe</em>!</p><blockquote><h1>The emerging, more holistic
    paradigm of biological regulation and identity now holds that the identity of
    biological subjects is often not that of one species alone: the majority of organisms
    must be viewed as ‘metabiomes’ consisting of thousands of symbiotic, mostly bacterial
    species, according to recent research.</h1><h1>Andreas Weber (2013: 29)</h1></blockquote><p>The
    American biologist, Craig Holdrege, offers a process-oriented understanding of
    biological organisms in his insightful article ‘Where do organisms end?’. He suggests
    a shift “from a traditional notion of separate biological organism to the conception
    of ecological organisms, of which the biological organisms are part”. In this
    perspective “the organism *is *interaction with other organisms within the context
    of a habitat. The single organism (or species) that is supposed to compete with
    others *does not exist *[original italics]. It is far more appropriate to view
    organisms as members of a differentiable whole that has never dissolved into discrete
    entities” (Holdrege, 2000: 16).</p><p>Whether we see isolated individuals in competition
    or interconnected communities in collaboration depends on our perspective. Both
    perspectives are useful and valid ways of approaching the individual-whole paradox
    of existing — subjectively and individually — in relationship and indivisible
    from the whole. In allowing both perspectives to inform our scientific investigations
    and our view of natural process, we overcome the perceptual blind-spot created
    by the dominant focus on competitive individual interactions.</p><p>Once we do
    this, we will find that the regenerative whole-system dynamics that create conditions
    conducive to life are predominantly collaborative in nature. Long-term survival
    (sustainability and regeneration) depends on these collaborative interactions,
    while the competitive interactions we have mainly focused on play a subordinate
    role of fine-tuning system dynamics in the short term.</p><p>The biologist and
    philosopher Andreas Weber argues that the leading edge of our scientific understanding
    of life is asking us to reintegrate the subjective experience of being alive as
    co-creative participants of evolution into our cultural narrative. He calls for
    an “<a href="https://www.boell.de/en/2013/02/01/enlivenment-towards-fundamental-shift-concepts-nature-culture-and-politics">enlivenment</a>”,
    a second enlightenment, which recognizes that our human meaning- making is in
    itself an expression of living process.</p><p>If we are to co-create regenerative
    cultures everywhere, we have to come alive to the fact that we are *as life *capable
    of participating appropriately in living process. Our actions *and *how we create
    meaning are capable of creating conditions conducive to life.</p><p>The new biology,
    just like the new physics over one hundred years ago, is beginning to understand
    that we — and life as a whole — are far more interconnected and interdependent
    than our narrow focus on individual competition and scarcity has allowed us to
    see. The emerging understanding of life reflects the paradox of existing simultaneously
    as individual participants in — *and *as subjective reflections of — the whole.</p><p>We
    are — as individuals — indivisible from the ecosystem and the biosphere we co-
    create with all of life. Paradoxically, both collaboration and competition contribute
    to how life creates conditions conducive to life.</p><blockquote><h1>“The biosphere
    is not cooperative in a simple, straight-forward way, but *paradoxically *cooperative.
    Symbiotic relationships emerge out of antagonistic, incompatible processes.”</h1><h1>—
    Andreas Weber, 2013: 32</h1></blockquote><p>We have to keep these new biological
    insights and the paradoxical relationship of individual/whole and competition/collaboration
    in mind when we aim to create regenerative human systems that emulate the dynamics
    and patterns of ecosystems. Andreas Weber points out:</p><blockquote><h1>[Darwinian]
    evolutionary biology is a more accurate reflection of pre- Victorian social practices
    than of natural reality. In the wake of this metaphorical takeover, such concepts
    as ‘struggle for existence’, ‘competition’, and ‘fitness’ — which were central
    justifications of the political status quo in (pre) Victorian England — tacitly
    became centrepieces of our own self- understanding as embodied and social beings.
    And they still are. […] Biological, technological, and social progress, so the
    argument goes, is brought forth by the sum of individual egos striving to out-compete
    each other. In perennial rivalry, fit species (powerful corporations) exploit
    niches (markets) and multiply their survival rate (profit margins), whereas weaker
    (less efficient) ones go extinct (bankrupt). This metaphysics of economics and
    nature, however, is far more revealing about our society’s opinion about itself
    than it is an objective account of the biological world.</h1><h1>Andreas Weber
    (<a href="https://www.boell.de/en/2013/02/01/enlivenment-towards-fundamental-shift-concepts-nature-culture-and-politics">2013</a>:
    24)</h1></blockquote><p>Before we can explore how to redesign our industries,
    agriculture, the economy and the way we do business based on the regenerative
    dynamics that create ecosystems and planetary health, we have to raise awareness
    of how our understanding of biology and economics has for a long time been based
    on a series of blinkered assumptions and limiting metaphors. Many of the key concepts
    that helped Charles Darwin to construct the central argument of his theory of
    evolution by natural selection were influenced by the economic theories of his
    time, for example the work of Adam Smith and the political economist Robert Malthus’s
    obsession with “the idea of scarcity as a driving force of social change” (Weber,
    2013: 24).</p><p>The limited narrative of separation, with its exclusively competition-
    and scarcity- focused understanding of life, is supported by outdated biological
    and economic theories. Weber calls this an “economic ideology of nature” and suggests
    that an ideologically biased perspective “reigns supreme over our understanding
    of human culture and world. It defines our embodied dimension (<em>Homo sapiens
    *as a gene-governed survival machine) as well as our social identity (</em>Homo
    economicus *as an egoistic maximizer of utility). The idea of universal competition
    unifies the two realms, the natural and the socio-economic. It validates the notion
    of rivalry and predatory self-interest as inexorable facts of life” (pp.25–26).</p><p>If
    we understand life and evolution as a whole system in transformation, we begin
    to pay attention to relationships and networks of participants in that system,
    and suddenly we see collaboration, symbiosis and co-evolution as the prevalent
    patterns maintaining systemic health. Seeing competitive interactions between
    individual participants of the whole as the main characteristic defining and governing
    biological and socio-economic processes is a little bit like looking at the waves
    (competition) on the surface of an ocean but not seeing the immense body of water
    (cooperation) below. Life thrives through collaboration.</p><p>The optimization
    of resource-sharing and processing in order to share and generate abundance and
    systemic health equitably, rather than competition for scarce resources, is the
    basis of life’s way of doing economics. In attempting to create a life-friendly
    economy, we need to understand the profound implications that the emerging ‘systems
    view of life’ has for our undertaking.</p><p>Building on the notion of *a science
    of qualities *introduced by the biologist and mathematician Brian Goodwin, the
    physicist and systems thinker Prof. Fritjof Capra and Prof. Pier Luigi Luisi,
    a chemist working in the biology department of Roma Tre University, argue:</p><blockquote><h1>As
    the twenty-first century unfolds, a new scientific conception is emerging. It
    is a unified view that integrates, for the first time, life’s biological, cognitive,
    social, and economic dimensions. At the forefront of contemporary science, the
    universe is no longer seen as a machine composed of elementary building blocks.
    We have discovered that the material world, ultimately, is a network of inseparable
    patterns of relationships; that the planet as a whole is a living, self- regulating
    system. […] Evolution is no longer seen as a competitive struggle for existence,
    but rather a cooperative dance in which creativity and constant emergence of novelty
    are the driving forces. And with the new emphasis on complexity, networks, and
    patterns of organization, a new science of qualities is slowly emerging.</h1><h1>Fritjof
    Capra and Pier Luigi Luisi (2014b)</h1></blockquote><p>What is being called into
    question here is not the overall process of biological evolution, but whether
    competition for scarce resources rather than symbiotic networks in which life
    creates conditions conducive to life are the main drivers of speciation and evolution
    of life as an interconnected process. New insights in biology, neuroscience and
    evolutionary theory are offering a perspective that helps us to retell the story
    about who we are as biophysical beings.</p><p>Truly understanding ourselves individually
    and collectively as ‘being <em>in *and *through *relationships’ is the conceptual/perceptual
    meta-design shift that underlies the cultural transformation that is under way.
    We are transforming a globalized but fragmented humanity based on the *narrative
    of separation *and competition into globally cooperative networks of locally adapted
    cultures sharing a unifying *narrative of interbeing</em>.</p><p><strong>How can
    we create a regenerative material culture and industrial system based on collaboration?</strong></p><p><strong>How
    can we co-create a regenerative approach to agriculture that supports food and
    water security, climate change mitigation, local living economies, healthy local
    ecosystems and product diversity based on biomaterials?</strong></p><p><strong>What
    would a regenerative economy with predominantly collaborative relationships look
    like?</strong></p><p><strong>Understanding that long-term, collaborative advantage
    trumps short- term, competitive advantage as the success strategy in healthy systems,
    how would we redesign the way we do business?</strong></p><p><strong>How will
    we redesign our economic systems to reflect the insight that collaborative participation
    in life-sustaining relationships is life’s fundamental principle of evolution?</strong></p><p>From
    a scale-linking, systemic and long-term perspective of natural processes we begin
    to realize that those isolated, competitive interactions we do observe from a
    short-term perspective are actually embedded in a context of systemic, long-term
    collaboration. All regenerative systems are fundamentally collaborative. Optimization
    of the whole based on symbiotic relationships over the long term is the hallmark
    of regenerative systems.</p><p>The *systems view of life *(Capra &amp; Luisi,
    2014a), as a fundamentally collaborative interconnected process, is inviting us
    to redesign the human presence on Earth based on our new understanding of the
    way life unlocks abundance through collaboration. The emerging practices of industrial
    ecology, integrated ecological design and regenerative agriculture, as well as
    the move towards circular regenerative economies based on locally regenerated
    biological resources, are part of a fundamental redesign that will lead to the
    emergence of regenerative cultures. Regenerative systems are primarily collaborative

  :title: One Virus. Two Cultures.
  :content: '<p>by Jean-Louis Gassée</p><h3><em>Some thoughts on the differences between
    the French and US reactions to the Covid-19 pandemic from a native Frenchman and
    proud US citizen.</em></h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*byCCOzNJZQIyppoFxJSJVw.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>We moved to Palo Alto in 1989, a few weeks before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Loma_Prieta_earthquake">Loma
    Prieta earthquake</a>. In retrospect, it was a minor disturbance compared to today’s
    challenges. Four times a year we fly to Paris to spend time with family and friends,
    sinning with controlled abandon. No more.</p><p>This gives rise to a somber meditation
    on the way the two cultures have handled the Covid-19 crisis. We’ll start with
    an obvious difference: healthcare.</p><p>France and the US were both equally ill-prepared,
    poorly stocked in the basic tools to combat the exponential rise of virus contamination,
    but beyond that, the two countries diverge. To put it summarily but not unfairly,
    in the US you can go bankrupt because you have cancer, you can lose insurance
    coverage if you lose your job, and so on. No such threat in most Western Europe
    countries.</p><p>In a March 2017 Monday Note titled <a href="https://mondaynote.com/the-hopeless-health-care-rip-off-336db325f69">The
    Hopeless Health Care Rip-Off</a>, I published this <a href="http://ourworldindata.org">ourworldindata.org</a>
    chart:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/1*9JwBk89ELOmrlDY-OcBTlQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>As one of my Be colleagues used to say: US healthcare costs more
    <em>but</em> it does less.</p><p>In the US, we spend trillions upon trillions
    in bailouts and losing Middle East wars, but we don’t seem to have the dollars
    — or guts — to dismantle the political structure that makes the healthcare regulation
    war unwinnable. The unshakable relationship between politics, insurance, hospital
    and drug companies has made the price of medicines and health services in the
    US inviolate. France, and most other Western democracies, see healthcare as a
    human right, not a profit center.</p><p>Let’s move to confinement at home.</p><p>The
    latest California decree lets me take long walks for my health and go shopping
    for groceries. I appreciate the freedom, although at my age (76) and burdened
    by a hematological problem, my wife and I opt for home delivery instead of <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail_therapy">retail therapy</a>, and enjoy
    long video conferences with family and friends.</p><p>In France, after a sequence
    of progressively tighter restrictions, you now must carry a certificate that justifies
    your need to leave your domicile. You can go to work, or to the doctor or supermarket,
    but jogging and cycling expeditions are verboten beyond one kilometer — 2/3 of
    a mile — from your home, and only one person at a time. The police are everywhere
    and the fines are heavy: $150 for the first infraction, escalating rapidly, ending
    with prison sentences for repeat offenders.</p><p>On the bright side, Europeans
    open their windows at 8pm to applaud and sing homage to the doctors, nurses and
    other healthcare workers on the front lines combating the pandemic (<a href="https://time.com/5807592/europeans-sing-coronavirus-healthcare-workers/">*from
    Time magazine</a>*):</p><blockquote><p>“They stand at open windows or on balconies
    in Rome, Madrid, Paris, Athens and Amsterdam, singing, cheering and applauding
    even though they know their intended audience is too busy to listen. The adulation
    is for the doctors, nurses and other health care workers putting themselves at
    risk on the front lines of the pandemic that is forcing most residents to stay
    home.”</p></blockquote><p>In both nations we see signs of rebellion — or boredom.
    Here, we had a boisterous and defiant display of crowded Florida beaches during
    Spring Break, a scene that admits a dark, almost funereal thought as we imagine
    the revelers returning to their colleges at the country’s four corners, likely
    spreading the virus.</p><p>In the poor areas of Paris and other big European cities,
    where the black market economy is the only way to make ends meet, people are showing
    signs of restlessness and, a readiness to revolt against authorities. Although
    the police have been instructed to employ a “discerning attitude” towards the
    sale of contraband, customers’ freedom of movement is so severely curtailed that
    there’s no commerce to ignore. Some French government officials foolishly applaud
    the situation as a new found sobriety; the more experienced ministers understand
    that the last thing France needs is social unrest as it deals with shortages in
    hospital beds, respirators, masks, and test kits.</p><p>(Anecdotally, my friends
    in France profess incredulity when they learn that San Francisco’s mayor London
    Breed has <em>finally</em> deemed cannabis dispensaries “essential activities”
    and can stay open even as bars must remain closed. I point out that while their
    Gallic sense of proportion and justice is commendable, it’s too bad that they
    risk jail for their weekend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol">CBD</a>
    or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol">THC</a> relaxations.)</p><p>We
    now must turn to a serious topic of both ethical and political importance: When
    to reopen the economy. According to <a href="http://worldometers.com">worldometers.com</a>,
    France has more than 37K cases and 2.3K deaths, and the numbers double every three
    or four days. The US has 123K cases — the most for any country — and 2.2K deaths.
    With these growing numbers, how does one balance confinement, which clearly saves
    lives, versus restarting the economy in order to save livelihoods?</p><p>The thought
    in the US, at least as exemplified by the President, is that we mustn’t kill the
    economy in the uncertain hope of saving a few lives. We should forge ahead and
    reboot the country back into business in short order — say two weeks from now,
    on a beautiful Easter Sunday.</p><p>In Europe, the inclination is to keep saving
    lives, economic costs be damned. The devastation in Italy, Spain, and now in France
    has led <a href="https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/rest-of-the-world-news/philippe-first-15-days-of-april-will-be-difficult.html">Prime
    Minister Édouard Philippe to concede that the worst is yet to come</a>, that France
    needs to maintain its current confinement measures for another two weeks and probably
    more.</p><p>The US and French governments have at their disposal some of the best
    actuaries and economists, people who can perform sophisticated cost-benefit analyses
    of a number of scenarios. Another week of lockdown will cost <em>X</em> jobs and
    require <em>Y</em> dollars (or euros) but will save <em>Z</em> lives.</p><p>Thinking
    in absolutist terms, one couldn’t take the wheel because of a possible deadly
    accident a few miles from home. In deciding to drive our vehicles, we make a probabilistic
    cost-benefit analysis. We decide that the cost of driving, the possibility, the
    cost of getting killed, is vastly outweighed by the benefit of getting to work
    or to the beach.</p><p>The problem with applying economic impact versus lives
    saved to this situation is that we’re dealing with non-linear phenomena. With
    the exponential growth curves we’ve observed in contaminations and deaths, a small
    variance in initial estimates yields large uncertainties as weeks or months are
    forecast. We don’t know enough about this virus, about silent propagation by asymptomatic
    carriers to be certain of our assumptions. We don’t know enough but decision time
    comes and a scenario must be picked. This is when other factors weigh in.</p><p>In
    France, there is no presidential election for another two years. In the US we’re
    voting next November and the state of the economy will weigh heavily on the result.</p><p>Two
    apparently simple scenarios then emerge.</p><p>France’s lesser electoral pressure
    allows it to pick a more humanistic scenario, keeping the economy locked down
    a little longer in order to save more lives. In the US, the White House team believes
    rebooting the economy as soon as possible will keep the current resident in office
    for another four years — at the possible cost of the thousand of lives that would
    have been saved had the lockdown stayed in force for another month or two.</p><p>But
    there’s a problem with the apparent simplicity: we don’t really know.</p><p>We
    don’t really know how long the French will tolerate the very strict lockdown before
    another wave, stronger this time than last year’s Yellow Vests, succeeds in toppling
    the Macron presidency.</p><p>We don’t know, in these non-linear times, how soon
    and how well the US economy would reboot, and we don’t know how many more thousands
    of people would die in the meantime and how strong the public revulsion would
    be.</p><p>Non-linear times indeed.</p><p><em>— JLG@mondaynote.com</em></p>'

  :title: Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming
  :content: "<p>I’ve been programming in Object Oriented languages for decades. The
    first OO language I used was C++ and then Smalltalk and finally .NET and Java.</p><p>I
    was gung-ho to leverage the benefits of <strong><em>Inheritance</em></strong>,
    <strong><em>Encapsulation</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Polymorphism</em></strong>.
    The Three Pillars of the Paradigm.</p><p>I was eager to gain the promise of Reuse
    and leverage the wisdom gained by those who came before me in this new and exciting
    landscape.</p><p>I couldn’t contain my excitement at the thought of mapping my
    real-world objects into their Classes and expected the whole world to fall neatly
    into place.</p><p><strong>I couldn’t have been more wrong.</strong></p><h2>Inheritance,
    the First Pillar to Fall</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*T2x8IApyIXIs4nNexGryEw.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>At first glance, Inheritance appears to be the biggest benefit
    of the Object Oriented Paradigm. All the simplistic examples of shape hierarchies
    that are paraded out as examples to the newly indoctrinated seem to make logical
    sense.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*o-Mdcrd9B5hTrrQKhcP8yA.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>And Reuse is the word of the day. No… make that the year and perhaps
    evermore.</p><p>I swallowed this whole and rushed out into the world with my newfound
    insight.</p><h3>Banana Monkey Jungle Problem</h3><p>With religion in my heart
    and problems to solve, I started building Class Hierarchies and writing code.
    And all was right with the world.</p><p>I’ll never forget that day when I was
    ready to cash in on the promise of Reuse by inheriting from an existing class.
    This was the moment I had been waiting for.</p><p>A new project came along and
    I thought back to that Class that I was so fond of in my last project.</p><p>No
    problem. Reuse to the rescue. All I gotta do is simply grab that Class from the
    other project and use it.</p><p>Well… actually… not just that Class. We’re gonna
    need the parent Class. But… But that’s it.</p><p>Ugh… Wait… Looks like we gonna
    also need the parent’s parent too... And then… We’re going to need ALL of the
    parents. Okay… Okay… I handle this. No problem.</p><p>And great. Now it won’t
    compile. Why?? Oh, I see… <strong><em>This</em></strong> object contains <strong><em>this
    other</em></strong> object. So I’m gonna need that too. No problem.</p><p>Wait…
    I don’t just need <strong><em>that</em></strong> object. I need the object’s parent
    and its parent’s parent and so on and so on with every contained object and ALL
    the parents of what those contain along with their parent’s, parent’s, parent’s…</p><p>Ugh.</p><p>There’s
    a great quote by <strong><em>Joe Armstrong</em></strong>, the creator of Erlang:</p><blockquote><p>The
    problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit environment
    that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla
    holding the banana and the entire jungle.</p></blockquote><h3>Banana Monkey Jungle
    Solution</h3><p>I can tame this problem by not creating hierarchies that are too
    deep. But if Inheritance is the key to Reuse, then any limits I place on that
    mechanism will surely limit the benefits of Reuse. Right?</p><p>Right.</p><p>So
    what’s a poor Object Oriented Programmer, who’s had a healthy helping of the Kool-aid,
    to do?</p><p>Contain and Delegate. More on this later.</p><h3>The Diamond Problem</h3><p>Sooner
    or later, the following problem will rear its ugly and, depending on the language,
    unsolvable head.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*88yGno_LfU7P26RAHLGHCw.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Most OO languages do not support this, even though this <strong><em>seems</em></strong>
    to make logical sense. What’s so difficult about supporting this in OO languages?</p><p>Well,
    imagine the following pseudocode:</p><pre><code>Class PoweredDevice {}Class Scanner
    inherits from PoweredDevice {  function start() {  }}Class Printer inherits from
    PoweredDevice {  function start() {  }}Class Copier inherits from Scanner, Printer
    {}</code></pre><p>Notice that both the <em>Scanner</em> class and the <em>Printer</em>
    class implement a function called <em>start</em>.</p><p>So which start function
    does the <em>Copier</em> class inherit? The <em>Scanner</em> one? The <em>Printer</em>
    one? It can’t be both.</p><h3>The Diamond Solution</h3><p>The solution is simple.
    Don’t do that.</p><p>Yes that’s right. Most OO languages don’t let you do this.</p><p>But,
    but… what if I have to model this? I want my Reuse!</p><p>Then you must <strong>Contain
    and Delegate</strong>.</p><pre><code>Class PoweredDevice {}Class Scanner inherits
    from PoweredDevice {  function start() {  }}Class Printer inherits from PoweredDevice
    {  function start() {  }}Class Copier {  Scanner scanner  Printer printer  function
    start() {    printer.start()  }}</code></pre><p>Notice here that the <em>Copier</em>
    class now contains an instance of a <em>Printer</em> and of a <em>Scanner</em>.
    It delegates the <em>start</em> function to the <em>Printer</em> class’s implementation.
    It could just as easily delegated to the <em>Scanner</em>.</p><p>This problem
    is yet another crack in the Inheritance pillar.</p><h3>The Fragile Base Class
    Problem</h3><p>So I’m making my hierarchies shallow and keeping them from being
    cyclical. No diamonds for me.</p><p>And all was right with the world. That is
    until…</p><p>One day, my code works and the next day it stops working. Here’s
    the kicker. <strong>I didn’t change my code</strong>.</p><p>Well, maybe it’s a
    bug… But wait… <strong>Something did change</strong>…</p><p><strong>But it wasn’t
    in my code</strong>. Turns out the change was in the class that I inherited from.</p><p>How
    could a change in the Base class break my code??</p><p>This is how…</p><p>Imagine
    the following Base class (It’s written in Java, but it should be easy to understand
    if you don’t know Java):</p><pre><code>import java.util.ArrayList;public class
    Array{  private ArrayList&lt;Object&gt; a = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;();  public
    void add(Object element)  {    a.add(element);  }  public void addAll(Object elements[])
    \ {    for (int i = 0; i &lt; elements.length; ++i)      **a.add(elements[i]);
    // this line is going to be changed**  }}</code></pre><p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>:
    Notice the commented line of code. This line is going to be changed later which
    will break things.</p><p>This class has 2 functions on its interface, <strong><em>add()</em></strong>
    and <strong><em>addAll()</em></strong>. The <strong><em>add()</em></strong> function
    will add a single element and <strong><em>addAll()</em></strong> will add multiple
    elements <strong>by calling the add function</strong>.</p><p>And here’s the Derived
    class:</p><pre><code>public class ArrayCount extends Array{  private int count
    = 0;  [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override)  public void add(Object element)
    \ {    super.add(element);    ++count;  }  [@Override](http://twitter.com/Override)
    \ public void addAll(Object elements[])  {    super.addAll(elements);    count
    += elements.length;  }}</code></pre><p>The <strong><em>ArrayCount</em></strong>
    class is a specialization of the general <strong><em>Array</em></strong> class.
    The <strong>only</strong> behavioral difference is that the <strong><em>ArrayCount</em></strong>
    keeps a <strong><em>count</em></strong> of the number of elements.</p><p>Let’s
    look at both of these classes in detail.</p><p>The <strong><em>Array</em></strong>
    <strong><em>add()</em></strong> adds an element to a local <strong><em>ArrayList</em></strong>.The
    <strong><em>Array</em></strong> <strong><em>addAll()</em></strong> calls the local
    <strong>ArrayList</strong> add for each element.</p><p>The <em>**ArrayCount</em>*
    <strong>add()</strong>* calls its parent’s <strong><em>add()</em></strong> and
    then increments the <strong><em>count</em></strong>.The <strong>ArrayCount</strong>
    <strong><em>addAll()</em></strong> calls its parent’s <strong><em>addAll()</em></strong>
    and then increments the <strong><em>count</em></strong> by the number of elements.</p><p>And
    all works fine.</p><p>Now for the <strong>breaking change</strong>. The commented
    line of code in the Base class is changed to the following:</p><pre><code>  public
    void addAll(Object elements[])  {    for (int i = 0; i &lt; elements.length; ++i)
    \     **add(elements[i]); // this line was changed**  }</code></pre><p>As far
    as the owner of the Base class is concerned, it still functions as advertised.
    <strong>And all of the automated tests still pass</strong>.</p><p>But the owner
    is oblivious to the Derived class. And the owner of Derived class is in for a
    rude awakening.</p><p>Now <strong><em>ArrayCount addAll()</em></strong> calls
    its parent’s <strong><em>addAll()</em></strong> which <strong>internally</strong>
    calls the <strong><em>add()</em></strong> which has been <strong>OVERRIDEN</strong>
    by the <strong>Derived</strong> class.</p><p>This causes the <strong><em>count</em></strong>
    to be incremented each time the <strong>Derived</strong> class’s <strong><em>add()</em></strong>
    is called and then it’s <strong>incremented</strong> <strong>AGAIN</strong> by
    the number of elements that were added in the <strong>Derived</strong> class’s
    <strong><em>addAll()</em></strong>.</p><p><strong>IT’S COUNTED TWICE.</strong></p><p>If
    this can happen, and it does, the author of the Derived class must KNOW how the
    Base class has been implemented. And they must be informed about every change
    in the Base class since it could break their Derived class in unpredictable ways.</p><p>Ugh!
    This huge crack is forever threatening the stability of precious Inheritance pillar.</p><h3>The
    Fragile Base Class Solution</h3><p>Once again Contain and Delegate to the rescue.</p><p>By
    using Contain and Delegate, we go from White Box programming to Black Box programming.
    With White Box programming, we have to look at the implementation of the base
    class.</p><p>With Black Box programming, we can be completely ignorant of the
    implementation since we cannot inject code into the Base class by overriding one
    of its functions. We only have to concern ourselves with the Interface.</p><p>This
    trend is disturbing…</p><p>Inheritance was supposed to be a huge win for Reuse.</p><p>Object
    Oriented languages don’t make Contain and Delegate easy to do. They were designed
    to make Inheritance easy.</p><p>If you’re like me, you’re starting to wonder about
    this Inheritance thing. But more important, this should shake your confidence
    in the power of Classification via Hierarchies.</p><h3>The Hierarchy Problem</h3><p>Every
    time I start at a new company, I struggle with the problem when I’m creating a
    place to put my Company Documents, e.g. the Employee Handbook.</p><p>Do I create
    a folder called Documents and then create a folder called Company in that?</p><p>Or
    do I create a folder called Company and then create a folder called Documents
    in that?</p><p>Both work. But which is right? Which is best?</p><p>The idea of
    Categorical Hierarchies was that there were Base Classes (parents) that were more
    general and that Derived Classes (children) were more specialized versions of
    those classes. And even more specialized as we make our way down the inheritance
    chain. (See the Shape Hierarchy above)</p><p>But if a parent and child could arbitrarily
    switch places, then clearly something is wrong with this model.</p><h3>The Hierarchy
    Solution</h3><p>What’s wrong is…</p><p><strong>Categorical Hierarchies don’t work</strong>.</p><p>So
    what are hierarchies good for?</p><p><strong>Containment</strong>.</p><p>If you
    look at the real world, you’ll see Containment (or Exclusive Ownership) Hierarchies
    everywhere.</p><p>What you won’t find is Categorical Hierarchies. Let that sink
    in for a moment. The Object Oriented Paradigm was predicated upon the real world,
    one filled with Objects. But then it uses a broken model, viz. Categorical Hierarchies,
    where there is no real-world analogy.</p><p>But the real world is filled with
    Containment Hierarchies. A great example of a Containment Hierarchy is your socks.
    They are in a sock drawer which is contained in one drawer in your dresser which
    is contained in your bedroom which is contained in your house, etc.</p><p>Directories
    on your hard drive are another example of a Containment Hierarchy. They contains
    files.</p><p>So how do we categorize then?</p><p>Well, if you think of the Company
    Documents, it pretty much doesn’t matter where I put them. I can put them in a
    folder of Documents or a folder called Stuff.</p><p>The way I categorize it is
    with tags. I tag the file with the following tags:</p><pre><code>DocumentCompanyHandbook</code></pre><p>Tags
    have no order or hierarchy. (This solves the Diamond Problem too.)</p><p>Tags
    are analogous to interfaces since you can have multiple types associated with
    the document.</p><p>But with so many cracks, it looks like the Inheritance pillar
    has fallen.</p><p><strong>Goodbye, Inheritance.</strong></p><h2>Encapsulation,
    the Second Pillar to Fall</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ta9gcTzwC_RxZxvD7EhlAw.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>At first glance, Encapsulation appears to be second biggest benefit
    of Object Oriented Programming.</p><p>Object state variables are protected from
    outside access, i.e. they’re Encapsulated in the Object.</p><p>No longer will
    we have to worry about global variables that are being accessed by who-knows-who.</p><p>Encapsulation
    is a Safe for your variables.</p><p>This Encapsulation thing is INCREDIBLE!!</p><p>Long
    live Encapsulation…</p><p>That is until…</p><h3>The Reference Problem</h3><p>For
    efficiency sake, Objects are passed to functions NOT by their value but by reference.</p><p>What
    that means is that functions will not pass the Object, but instead pass a <strong><em>reference</em></strong>
    or pointer to the Object.</p><p>If an Object is passed by reference to an Object
    Constructor, the constructor can put that Object reference in a private variable
    which is protected by Encapsulation.</p><p>But the passed <strong>Object is NOT
    safe!</strong></p><p>Why not? Because some other piece of code has a pointer to
    the Object, viz. the code that called the Constructor. It MUST have a reference
    to the Object otherwise it couldn’t pass it to the Constructor?</p><h3>The Reference
    Solution</h3><p>The Constructor will have to Clone the passed in Object. And not
    a shallow clone but a deep clone, i.e. every object that is contained in the passed
    in Object and every object in those objects and so on and so on.</p><p>So much
    for efficiency.</p><p>And here’s the kicker. Not all objects can be Cloned. Some
    have Operating System resources associated with them making cloning useless at
    best or at worst impossible.</p><p>And <strong>EVERY</strong> single mainstream
    <strong>OO language</strong> has this problem.</p><p><strong>Goodbye, Encapsulation.</strong></p><h2>Polymorphism,
    the Third Pillar to Fall</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3000/1*PgDq0T-0PpSd-huvTaZxkw.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Polymorphism was the redheaded stepchild of the Object Oriented
    Trinity.</p><p>It’s sort of the Larry Fine of the group.</p><p>Everywhere they
    went he was there, but he was just a supporting character.</p><p>It’s not that
    Polymorphism isn’t great, it’s just that you don’t need an Object Oriented language
    to get this.</p><p>Interfaces will give you this. And without all of the baggage
    of OO.</p><p>And with Interfaces, there isn’t a limit to how many different behaviors
    you can mix in.</p><p>So without much ado, we say goodbye to <strong>OO</strong>
    Polymorphism and hello to <strong>interface-based</strong> Polymorphism.</p><h2>Broken
    Promises</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*BKqtA-ynElomtJ7v6n5FHw.png\"

  :title: What programming language should you learn first?
  :content: "<p>Most people’s journey toward learning to program starts with a single
    late-night Google search.</p><p>Usually it’s something like “Learn ______”</p><p>But
    how do they decide which language to search for?</p><blockquote><h1>“They always
    joke about Java on Silicon Valley. I guess I should learn that.”</h1></blockquote><p>Or:</p><blockquote><h1>“Haskell.
    So hot right now. Haskell.”</h1></blockquote><p>Or:</p><blockquote><h1>“That Go
    gopher is just so gosh-darn cute.”</h1></blockquote><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7722/1*7kbd-tVk3co-9RiilFN1TA.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>And then there’s the rest of us. We’ll probably search for something
    like:</p><blockquote><h1>“Which programming language should I learn first?”</h1></blockquote><p>Few
    questions are so commonly asked that they get the full infographic treatment.
    But this is one of them:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2864/1*OF594B5qtCJR9MFSRTI-5g.png\"
    alt=\"[Image credit](http://carlcheo.com/startcoding)\"><em><a href=\"http://carlcheo.com/startcoding\">Image
    credit</a></em></p><p>Deciding on your first programming language can be a fun
    process — kind of like one of those “Which Quentin Tarantino character are you?”
    personality quizzes.</p><p>But before you run off to learn Ruby because you enjoyed
    playing with Play-Doh as a kid, let me remind you: the stakes are pretty high
    here.</p><p>It will take you hundreds of hours of practice to become even remotely
    competent with your first programming language.</p><p>So you should consider the
    following factors:</p><ul><li><p>the job market for the language</p></li><li><p>the
    long term prospects for the language</p></li><li><p>how easy the language is to
    learn</p></li><li><p>what projects you can build while you’re learning (and share
    with friends so you can stay motivated)</p></li></ul><p>Every year brings new
    programming languages, and with them, new academic papers. And new web comics.</p><p>Seriously.
    Check out this gem from last month:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*she624Vf-hrpgLdWd8hKKw.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>When it comes to choosing a first programming language, there’s
    no shortage of options. To narrow it down a bit, here are the most common Google
    searches related to learning programming, over the past 12 years:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2852/1*znaagCC5fn0-Dqy43ILeqQ.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Java has had its ups and downs.</p><p>Python has gradually risen
    to become the most popular choice.</p><p>But tucked away below these is the Little
    Engine That Could, slowly choo-choo’ing up in popularity over the past few years.
    And that engine is JavaScript.</p><p>Before I talk about these programming languages,
    let me clarify:</p><ul><li><p>I’m not arguing that any one language is objectively
    better than any other</p></li><li><p>I agree that developers should eventually
    learn more than one language</p></li><li><p>I’m arguing that first they should
    learn one language well. And — as you can probably guess from the upside down
    text in my headline — that language should be JavaScript.</p></li></ul><p>Let’s
    kick things off by exploring how programming is currently taught in school.</p><h2>Computer
    Science 101</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*eu4cWRZXUt3ybNFzeT-q8Q.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Universities have traditionally taught programming under the umbrella
    of computer science, which itself is often seen as an extension of mathematics,
    or tie-in to an electrical engineering degree.</p><p>Of course, as you may have
    heard by now:</p><blockquote><h1>“Computer science education cannot make anybody
    an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody
    an expert painter.” — Eric S. Raymond</h1></blockquote><p>As of 2016, many universities
    still treat programming like it’s computer science, and computer science like
    it’s math.</p><p>As a result, many introductory programming courses focus on low-level-of-abstraction
    languages like C, or mathematically-focused languages like MATLAB.</p><p>And department
    chairs generally stay the course, pointing to annual programming language leaderboards
    like the <a href=\"http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/\">TIOBE Index</a>, or this
    one from the <a href=\"http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2016-top-programming-languages\">IEEE</a>:</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*8yWwh_UrWeoxYSVsWTnEBA.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Most of these leaderboards look virtually identical to how they
    were 10 years ago.</p><p>But change does happen. Even in academia.</p><p>In 2014,
    Python <a href=\"http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-u-s-universities/fulltext\">overtook
    Java</a> as a the most popular language of instruction at top US Computer Science
    programs.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*728HWv2YP3PjY1_QmGQg1g.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>And yet another change is bound to… eventually… happen.</p><p>Because
    if you look at the languages actually used by the workforce, it paints a very
    different picture:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*fUxhG3xtbuyAH-NCPYs4lQ.png\"
    alt=\"JavaScript is by far the most popular language used by the 49,397 developers
    who responded to Stack Overflow’s 2016 Survey.\"><em>JavaScript is by far the
    most popular language used by the 49,397 developers who responded to Stack Overflow’s
    2016 Survey.</em></p><p>More than half of all developers use JavaScript. It’s
    vital to front-end web development and increasingly relevant for back-end development.
    And it’s rapidly expanding into areas like game development and the Internet of
    Things.</p><p>Job postings also mention JavaScript more than any programming language
    other than Java:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2196/1*Nju6ZEORusBE-4UB290Ftw.png\"
    alt=\"Data from the world’s largest job posting aggregator, [Indeed.com](http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends/q-java-q-python-q-javascript-q-ruby-q-php-q-android-q-ios.html)\"><em>Data

    no accident that we built our <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.com\">open source
    community</a>’s curriculum around JavaScript. Over the past two years, more than
    5,000 people have used Free Code Camp to get their first developer job.</p><p>I’m
    not advocating JavaScript because I teach it. I teach JavaScript because it’s
    the surest path to a first developer job.</p><p>But is JavaScript right for you?
    Is it worthy of being your first programming language? Let’s explore those factors
    I mentioned earlier.</p><h2>Factor #1: The job market</h2><p>If you’re learning
    to program purely out of intellectual curiosity, feel free to skip this factor.
    But if you — like the <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/we-asked-15-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-4104e29b2781#.30hlfqj32\">vast
    majority of people learning to program</a> — want to use this skill to get a job,
    this is an important consideration.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, Java is mentioned
    in more job postings than any other programming language. JavaScript is a close
    second.</p><p>But here’s the thing about JavaScript: even though it’s been around
    for 20 years, it only recently became a serious tool that companies like Netflix,
    Walmart, and PayPal would build entire applications around.</p><p>As a result,
    plenty of companies are hiring JavaScript developers, but there just aren’t that
    many on the job market.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2170/1*EanhlHoMIsF-By0gRrAcYQ.png\"
    alt=\"Data from [Indeed.com](http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends/q-java-q-python-q-javascript-q-ruby-q-php-q-android-q-ios.html)\"><em>Data
    from <a href=\"http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends/q-java-q-python-q-javascript-q-ruby-q-php-q-android-q-ios.html\">Indeed.com</a></em></p><p>There
    are 2.7 Java developers competing for every open Java position. Competition for
    PHP and iOS jobs is similarly fierce.</p><p>But for every open JavaScript position,
    there are only 0.6 JavaScript developers. It is very much a sellers’ market for
    developers with JavaScript skills.</p><h2>Factor #2: The long term prospects</h2><p>The
    average JavaScript project receives twice as many pull requests as the average
    Java, Python, or Ruby project. And on top of this, JavaScript is growing faster
    than any other popular language.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*-GxMW33X9Gb5lboyN02hKw.png\"
    alt=\"Source: The GitHub’s [2016 State of the Octoverse](https://octoverse.github.com/)\"><em>Source:
    The GitHub’s <a href=\"https://octoverse.github.com/\">2016 State of the Octoverse</a></em></p><p>JavaScript’s
    ecosystem also benefits from a heavy investment of money and engineering talent
    from companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Netflix.</p><p>For example,
    TypeScript (a statically-typed superset of JavaScript) has more than 100 open
    source contributors, many of whom are Microsoft and Google employees being paid
    to work on it.</p><p>This type of inter-company cooperation is harder to find
    with Java. Oracle — who effectively owns Java through its acquisition of Sun Microsystems
    — <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/why-todays-victory-over-oracle-matters-so-much-to-developers-4e24b4a368b5#.pk8efc9um\">often
    sues</a> companies who try to expand upon it.</p><h2>Factor #3: Difficulty to
    learn</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*d8TITW3skawGd-ioyHh2nQ.png\"
    alt=\"This is a parody of an [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/435/).\"><em>This is
    a parody of an <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/435/\">XKCD comic</a>.</em></p><p>Most
    programmers would agree that high-level scripting languages are relatively easy
    to learn. JavaScript falls into this category, along with Python and Ruby.</p><p>Even
    though universities still teach languages like Java and C++ as first languages,
    they’re considerably harder to learn.</p><h2>Factor #4: Projects you can build
    with it</h2><p>This is where JavaScript really shines. JavaScript runs on any
    device that has a browser, right there in the browser. You can build basically
    anything with JavaScript, and share it anywhere.</p><p>Because of JavaScript’s
    ubiquity, Stack Overflow co-founder Jeff Atwood coined his now-famous law:</p><blockquote><h1>“Any
    application that <em>can</em> be written in JavaScript, <em>will</em> eventually
    be written in JavaScript.”</h1></blockquote><p>And <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/atwoodslaw/\">with
    each passing month</a>, Atwood’s Law holds strong.</p><p>Java once promised to
    run everywhere, too. You may remember <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/a-brief-history-of-the-java-applet\">Java
    Applets</a>. Oracle officially killed them off earlier this year.</p><p>Python
    suffers from much the same problems:</p><blockquote><h1>“How can I give this game
    I made to my friend? Even better, is there a way can I put this on my phone so
    I can show it to kids at school without them having to install it? Um.” — James
    Hague in <a href=\"http://prog21.dadgum.com/203.html\">Retiring Python as a Teaching
    Language</a></h1></blockquote><p>By contrast, here are some apps that members
    of our open source community built in their browsers on CodePen. You can click
    through and use these right in your browser:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*i-bre5pF0rk6Wgz5yjugjw.png\"

    you keep jumping from language to language, <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/a-cautionary-tale-of-learning-to-code-my-own-eddb24d9d5a7\">you
    won’t get far</a>.</p><p>In order to move beyond the basics, you need to learn
    your first language well. Then your second language will be much, much easier.</p><p>From
    there, you can branch out, and become a more well-rounded developer by learning
    lots of languages:</p><ul><li><p>C is a great way to learn how computers actually
    work in terms of memory management, and is useful in high-performance computing</p></li><li><p>C++
    is great for game development.</p></li><li><p>Python is awesome for science and
    statistics.</p></li><li><p>Java is important if you want to work at large tech
    companies.</p></li></ul><p><strong>But learn JavaScript first.</strong></p><p>OK,
    now I’m going to attempt the impossible — I’m going to try and anticipate objections
    from the comments section.</p><h2>Objection #1: But isn’t JavaScript slow?</h2><p>JavaScript
    is — for most practical purposes — as fast as high-performance languages.</p><p>JavaScript
    (Node.js) is orders of magnitude faster than Python, Ruby, and PHP.</p><p>It is
    also nearly as fast as high-performance languages like C++, Java, and Go.</p><p>Here
    are the results of the most comprehensive recent cross-language benchmark:</p><p><img
    src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2642/1*h91cfcE8NlgyHfm4CLbV6w.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><h2>Objection #2: But JavaScript isn’t statically typed</h2><p>Like
    Python and Ruby, JavaScript is dynamically typed, which is convenient. But you
    can get into trouble. Here I intend for exampleArray to be an array. I set its
    values, then check its length — meaning the number of elements it contains.</p><pre><code>exampleArray
    = [1, 2]-&gt; [1, 2]exampleArray.length-&gt; 2</code></pre><p>But then I accidentally
    assign it to be a string.</p><pre><code>exampleArray = “text”-&gt; “text”exampleArray.length-&gt;
    4</code></pre><p>These kinds of errors happen all the time in dynamically typed
    languages. Most developers just put checks in place to prevent them, and write
    tests accordingly.</p><p>If you absolutely must have static typing in your first
    programming language, then I still recommend you learn JavaScript first. Then
    you can quickly pick up TypeScript.</p><blockquote><h1>“Typescript has a learning
    curve, but if you already know JavaScript, it will be a smooth one.” — <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/when-should-i-use-typescript-311cb5fe801b#.j920zs7g2\">Alex
    Ewerlöf on TypeScript</a></h1></blockquote><h2>Objection #3: But I really want
    to make a mobile app</h2><p>I still recommend learning JavaScript first.</p><ol><li><p>JavaScript
    features several tools for making native mobile apps, such as <a href=\"http://ngcordova.com/\">Angular
    Cordova</a> and <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/\">React Native</a>.</p></li><li><p>In
    order for your mobile app to actually do anything interesting, it will probably
    need a proper back end, which you’ll want to build with a proper web development
    framework, like Node.js + Express.js.</p></li></ol><p>Also, it’s worth pointing
    out that the mobile app development’s best days may very well be behind it.</p><p>For
    starters, as much as people use mobile apps, nearly half of all developer jobs
    are web development. Compare this with a mere 8% of jobs that involve mobile app
    development.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*6RsFHNgrzFyX-9p37FVtpA.jpeg\"

    downloading new apps</a>.</p><p>Sure — they still use apps. Mostly Facebook, Google
    Maps, and handful of others. As such, much of the demand for mobile app developers
    is concentrated in a few large employers.</p><p>The outlook for those mobile development
    jobs is hard to forecast. Many aspects of developing, maintaining, and distributing
    mobile apps are easier with JavaScript. So companies like Facebook and Google
    are investing heavily in better tools for building these using JavaScript.</p><p>As
    of 2016, pretty much all development is web development. Everything touches that
    big platform that is “the web.” And the next wave of devices that you’ll talk
    to around your home, and cars that pick your kids up from school — they’ll all
    be piped together using the web, too.</p><p>And that means JavaScript.</p><h2>Objection
    #4: Isn’t JavaScript a toy language that was written in 10 days?</h2><iframe src=\"https://medium.com/media/725495f00cb47d90634eff9263efdd7c\"

    people love to hate on C++, too. And like JavaScript, C++ has succeeded despite
    this hate, and now it’s pretty much everywhere as well.</p><p>So if anybody ever
    gives you a hard time for learning JavaScript instead of elite-language-of-the-week,
    just remember the famous words of the guy who created C++:</p><blockquote><h1>“There
    are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always bitch about and
    those nobody uses.” — Bjarne Stroustrup</h1></blockquote><p><strong>I only write

  :title: "“The Art of Computer Programming” by Donald Knuth"
  :content: '<p>Donald Knuth at the IBM 650 console; illustration by Siobhán K Cronin</p><p>Some
    books look so beautiful on the shelf. Not only for their aesthetic virtues, but
    for what their spines say about the owner. The four hardbound volumes of Donald
    Knuth’s “The Art of Computer Programming” — all snug in their dark purple case
    — send a clear message: Step aside, Muggles, because you’re in the presence of
    a Real Programmer. A Serious Practitioner of Computer Science.</p><p>Bill Gates
    once said, “If you think you’re a really good programmer… read Art of Computer
    Programming… You should definitely send me a résumé if you can read the whole
    thing.”</p><p>For me, the act of ordering this series felt like a major professional
    accomplishment. I allocated a special place on my shelf for these books before
    they arrived, as one might make room out in the barn for a shiny new mainframe.</p><p>The
    weight of their authority was so great that they became immovable. So I never
    read them, and this isn’t really a book review of the series. Sorry not sorry.</p><p>This
    also isn’t one of those reviews where the reviewer walked out of the movie early,
    in disgust. Knuth’s books are epic, and he is truly a master of the fundamentals
    of computer programming, its origins in mathematics, and the intersection of the
    two fields. So much respect.</p><p>It’s just that I’m not worthy of the depths
    of TAOCP.</p><p>I’ve read the preface of Volume 1 three or four times, and I’ve
    tried to imagine how it would feel to complete the entire series. I would disconnect
    from the Internet for a few months and move alone to a cabin on a Wyoming mountaintop
    with a ream of paper, a couple boxes of pencils, TAOCP, a few supplementary math
    books, and a 90 day supply of Adderall.</p><p>I would take long hikes in the mountains,
    thinking deeply about the fundamental algorithms. No laptop, no wifi, no electricity
    — these are all distractions. After sunset I’d read and work problem sets by candlelight,
    and my dreams would be joyrides through a universe of harmonic numbers, binomial
    coefficients, and nonlinear data structures.</p><p>But that’s never going to happen.
    So, yesterday as I was reviewing the preface again, I felt I should pause and
    reflect on my journey so far.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*RPiGQBLThunoBjN8OtxHnw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Such is Knuth’s love of computers, that the entire series is dedicated
    to one: the IBM 650 mainframe that was popular in the 1950s. It was the first
    “mass-produced” computer and it cost a few hundred thousand in todays dollars.
    This is the machine Knuth cut his teeth on.</p><p>To be excited about computers
    in the 1950s was to be excited about applied math. The early IBM 650 had basic
    math operations and control structures, and it was built around decimal math,
    not binary.</p><p>There was no display and no command line. The human was the
    operating system: a control console allowed The Operator to start and stop programs
    and so on.</p><p>Say you wanted to write a program to generate fibonacci numbers.
    FORTRAN didn’t exist yet — that came four years after the 650 was released. So,
    in those early years you had to write out the machine-level operation codes for
    what you wanted to do, and then hand-assemble your program and punch out a deck
    of cards with your program stamped into them using a key punch machine.</p><p>There
    were a couple ways to optimize your program. You could design a faster algorithm
    or deploy data structures that are better suited to the problem.</p><p>You could
    also optimize how your program loads and runs — working with the grain of the
    machinery. Magnetic drum memory, a forerunner to the modern hard drive, was the
    primary memory for the 650, and it was very slow. So your goal as a programmer
    was to minimize the rotational latency of the 12,500 RPM drum machine such that
    all of your code and data would be easily within reach of the CPU at the right
    moment during execution. You wanted perfect synchronization between the CPU cycles
    of the mainframe and these drum memory rotations.</p><p>Computer programming was
    forged here, at the rough intersection of mathematics and mechanical engineering.
    It could be completely understood by one very smart person. That is no longer
    true. Knuth and the programmers of that era had to be smarter than the IBM 650.
    They understood every vacuum tube and control switch. We are no longer smarter
    than our computers in this way.</p><p>In the first paragraph of the preface, Knuth
    calls programming “an aesthetic experience much like composing poetry or painting.”
    I think this aesthetic beauty still captivates every aspiring programmer. After
    traveling a great distance along an exponential curve since the 1950s, it’s comforting
    to know that beauty remains intact. Though we no longer hammer out software and
    feed it into a hot, loud calculator, the beauty of programming still infuses every
    layer of abstraction.</p><p>I wonder how the performative nature of writing software
    was shaped by the constraints of hand assembly within 8kb of memory, and by the
    labor of crafting punch cards. I imagine writing code in Knuth’s time had the
    thrill and the risk of walking a high wire. Small mistakes were painful.</p><p>Since
    then, decades of abstraction have stacked up like a pile of mattresses, and most
    of us just roll around on top.</p><p>The short feedback loop and malleability
    of today’s software comes with a price. While software development can be much
    more playful today, it’s also easier to hack before we think, and it can create
    a lot of problems. Great software still does require a lot of thought, and with
    ease we lose rigor.</p><p>The IBM 650’s constraints were hard and fast, and today’s
    constraints are softer and often self-imposed. The tiny screens of mobile phones
    have heralded a wave of innovations in economical software and interface design.
    And it strikes me that whoever chooses the constraints of the target development
    environment is choosing the playing field for our future innovations.</p>'

  :title: How I went from programming with a Nokia feature phone to working for an
    MIT Startup
  :content: "<p>In 2012, I was just a village boy from Nigeria who had nothing but
    a dream and a Nokia feature (J2ME) phone. Today, I’m a 19 year old Android developer
    who has worked on over 50 apps and currently works for an MIT startup. My name
    is Elvis Chidera and this is my story.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*wD_pWV3M0ZnAAimGMD_i0g.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>My journey began with my curiosity about how to build a website.
    Growing up, I spent a lot of time online as I loved downloading games and reading
    <a href=\"https://www.societyofrobots.com\">Society Of Robots</a>. I would save
    for weeks to buy a 10 MB internet bundle for 100 Naira ($0.28), and back in 2012,
    that could last for a month.</p><p>When learning to code, I took the first and
    simple step of doing a Google search about how to build a website. I got millions
    of results. Not knowing where to start, I clicked on the first link I saw, which
    was from <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com\">W3CSchools</a>.</p><p>The article
    explained that I need to learn some languages (HTML and CSS) to be able to build
    a website. I checked some other resources to confirm that I actually needed to
    learn these things. Then I started the W3CSchools HTML and CSS course.</p><p>Each
    day after school I would head over to the website to study. Initially, the code
    examples and explanations didn’t make much sense to me. But I kept studying regardless.
    I referred to various tutorials when I was stuck. This helped me view the problems
    I encountered from many different angles.</p><p>When I was younger, I struggled
    with my reading and writing skills in school. I was only able to get better at
    them through continuous practice. So I already had this model in my head: if I
    continue to practice — no matter how long it takes — I will ultimately be able
    to understand these programming languages.</p><p>A few months of intensive learning
    got me acquainted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I was still learning,
    a friend showed me the movie “The Social Network.” And after watching it, I was
    super motivated to build the next big thing. Thank you, Hollywood.</p><p>I had
    a eureka moment a few days later. The idea was to build a better version of Facebook.
    At that time, you couldn’t see your Facebook friends that were online. Also, Facebook
    was built to connect with people you already knew in real life.</p><p>So that
    was my billion dollar startup idea: build a social network with all the features
    Facebook didn’t have. Mark Zuckerberg - I’m coming for you - or so I thought.</p><p>I
    spent the next few months building a better social network by adding any feature
    I could even think of using.</p><p>I was naively confident that I was going to
    win.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*hr0jA_thHZpZ7GFKgWlGMA.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>After completing the project, I did what anybody without an advertising
    budget would do. I spammed the internet for days and days.</p><p>After several
    days of marketing, reality slapped me hard in the face. I only got 200 users,
    which I had to keep begging to come back to the site.</p><p>I was depressed! A
    few months of hard work spent in vain. This taught me two important lessons the
    hard way:</p><ol><li><p>I needed to recognize the <a href=\"http://platformed.info/seeding-two-sided-businesses-strategy-chicken-and-egg-problem/\">cold
    start AKA chicken and egg problem</a> that new platforms face early on.</p></li><li><p>I
    was building something I *<em>thought *</em>people needed. But I ended up building
    just another <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2\">feature
    factory</a>.</p></li></ol><p>While it’s okay to be motivated by a project, you
    also need to know when you’re headed down a dead end. I spent a few more months
    trying to see if I could get more people on my site, but retention numbers kept
    dancing toward 0%, and I eventually gave up on the project.</p><p>But I was motivated
    by the motto of Lewis in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Robinsons\">Meet
    the Robinsons</a>, “Keep moving forward.”</p><p>Seeking inspiration for my next
    project, I reflected on the needs of my local community. This time around, I wanted
    to build something that people actually needed and are willing to pay for.</p><p>I
    came up with an idea to make text messages cheaper and easier to send to multiple
    people at a time. This was more like Whatsapp backed by SMS. After speaking to
    different people about it, I decided this was the next thing to do.</p><p>I named
    the project Xmx Me. It was going to be a J2ME app. This meant I had to learn Java.
    Looking back in time, I have to admit that it was the biggest challenge I’d yet
    encountered. I had to read some tutorials several times to fully understand them.</p><p><img

    alt=\"Promotional graphics for Xmx Me\"><em>Promotional graphics for Xmx Me</em></p><p>After
    completing a few Java courses, I was ready for work. Relentlessly typing one line
    of code after another, I carefully built the backend with PHP, the frontend with
    HTML and CSS, and the mobile app with J2ME. The app was coming to life.</p><p>But
    here’s the thing — I didn’t own a laptop. I was building out all of these pieces
    of my app on my J2ME feature phone.</p><p>Wait. What?</p><p>You read that right.</p><p><img

    alt=\"I wrote my code on a Nokia 2690\"><em>I wrote my code on a Nokia 2690</em></p><h2>How
    I built my production apps on a feature phone</h2><p>At this point in my life,
    I had never actually programmed on a laptop. I simply couldn’t afford one. My
    parents wanted to help me. But it was difficult for them because they had to choose
    between paying my school fees (and other necessities) versus buying me a laptop.</p><p>I
    hadn’t used a laptop before, and my only interaction with computers was at cyber
    cafes. I remember watching some videos about how to use a computer (left click,
    drag, drop, and other basic stuff) and then walking into a cyber cafe to practice
    them.</p><p>I was lucky that a relative had gifted me a feature phone (<a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_2690-3004.php\">The
    Nokia 2690</a>). This phone changed my life. It’s what I used to develop Xmx Me,
    my failed social network, and several other projects.</p><p>With nothing but a
    phone and the will to succeed, hour after hour I typed my code on that tiny keyboard.
    I was lucky again to have found an app that allowed me to compile my <a href=\"http://elvischidera.blogspot.com.ng/2013/09/create-j2me-apps-with-your-mobile-phone.html\">J2ME
    projects</a>. Yes, building a J2ME app on a J2ME phone <em>is</em> possible.</p><p>The
    SDK was resource hungry, so my battery often died. I would carry on, writing out
    all my code on paper and try to review it for any syntax errors.</p><p>I don’t
    think I’ll fail any Java whiteboard coding tests after having done this for so
    long. :)</p><h2>Launching my group SMS app</h2><p>After several months, I had
    the product ready. I was able to convince someone I met on an internet forum to
    help me pay for the <a href=\"http://www.zettahost.com/\">website hosting</a>
    and the bulk <a href=\"http://www.80kobo.com/\">SMS service</a> for a limited
    number of SMS units.</p><p>The app launch went well — at least better than my
    first project. We got some local press, and one of Kenya’s top blogs even <a href=\"https://techmoran.com/xmx-mebulk-sms-app-developed-by-a-14-year-old-boy-from-port-harcourtnigeria/\">wrote
    about the app</a>. We grew organically to about 5,000 users.</p><p>We were in
    business. And we were getting transactions a couple of times a day.</p><p>With
    no prior experience running a business, I made some huge mistakes, some of which
    were:</p><ol><li><p>There was no easy way to charge users in Nigeria. Not everybody
    has a debit card. So I allowed people to pay using their mobile phone credit.
    The problem here was, there was no official way to convert this credit into money.
    I had to sell to vendors, who bought it back at a ridiculously low rates.</p></li><li><p>There
    was little to no accounting. I was losing money and I didn’t know about it. I
    didn’t factor in some overhead costs. There were several missing pieces.</p></li></ol><p>I
    was considering selling the App to buy a laptop. Not knowing what to do, I went
    <a href=\"http://www.nairaland.com/1339891/14-year-old-nigerian-bulk-sms-app\">online
    to beg</a>. Yes, I was that shameless and hungry. It didn’t turn out well. Somebody
    accused of being a scammer, which I eventually resolved. Again, I was inexperienced
    and I handled the situation poorly.</p><p>After borrowing money multiple times
    to keep the business running, I decided to throw in the towel. Looking back, I
    think this was a bad decision. With a little more learning and experience, I would
    have been able to make things better. Maybe I didn’t see any future in an SMS
    app. Well, I released a throwback app recently, and many of the users still use
    it and love it.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*gjQIIY_feDLAPIGGumvVfA.png\"
    alt=\"\"></p><h2>Lessons I learned along the way</h2><p>I realized that if I was
    going to be able to afford a computer anytime soon, I would need to work hard
    for it. So I began saving all the money I could. I cut my daily expenses and lived
    as simple a life as possible. I asked my relatives for help. I even sold some
    personal belongings to raise money for the laptop.</p><p>Still, it wasn’t enough.
    Determined to achieve my goal, I took on a freelance job of building a website
    so I could earn the remaining sum.</p><p>How do you use a feature phone to build
    a website designed for PC users? Simple: have a Facebook friend who you disturb
    every night to view your website on his computer and give you feedback. It was
    cheaper than going to a cyber cafe repeatedly.</p><p>I also made heavy use of
    <a href=\"http://ideone.com\">Ideone</a> which allowed me to run my PHP scripts
    to see if they work before uploading them.</p><p>Well, I finally was able to get
    that laptop. I can still remember the feeling of joy I had. That smell of plastic
    when you unbox a brand new cheap computer. I could now work on any project I wanted
    without feeling restricted because of my phone.</p><p>Since J2ME devices were
    slowly dying out, I eventually switched to building for the Android platform.
    My Java skills were still relevant there. I just needed to learn some platform-specific
    things.</p><p>The next year in 2015, after high school, I decided to start working
    to support my family. So I began freelancing. I was always active in local forums
    and groups, looking for people who wanted help with building an Android app.</p><p>Because
    I didn’t have a good portfolio, I would build apps for some people before they
    even paid, without any guarantee that I’d be paid. I was stung by this approach
    several times, but it allowed me to build a good enough portfolio.</p><p>I would
    like to share something I wish I knew while I was freelancing:</p><blockquote><h1>Don’t
    spread yourself too thin. Taking up too many responsibilities is not good for
    your health, your family, or the clients.</h1></blockquote><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Lc_U45aDF-OjboxDjyWnhg.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>I worked with several clients from different parts of Nigeria
    who loved my work. I eventually got a full-time job in Lagos, Nigeria after working
    with a client remotely.</p><p>Then, while going through my news feed, I saw a
    job advert for an Android developer position at <a href=\"http://www.dotlearn.org\">Dot
    Learn</a>. I looked them up and realized they are an MIT startup working in an
    education technology field that I was passionate about, and in a market I understood.
    They had a unique idea: to solve the problem of access to online education by
    making educational videos that are extremely data-light — as low as 1MB for every
    hour of video.</p><p>This was almost unbelievable, and I knew it was key to making
    education very accessible to a lot of people.</p><p>I am very passionate about
    revolutionizing education in Africa. In fact, I have already built a free (ad-supported)
    exam prep app called <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=elvis10ten.com.past_questions&hl=en\">PrepUp</a>
    that has over 35,000+ installs and was one of the finalists at the <a href=\"https://techpoint.ng/2016/03/24/west-africa-mobile-awards-2016-finalists/\">West
    Africa Mobile Awards in 2016</a>. So I wanted to be part of what Dot Learn was
    building.</p><p>So I went through the developer job requirements and I felt I
    had a chance. But impostor syndrome didn’t want me to be great.</p><p>For days
    I had conflicting thoughts. Should I apply or not?</p><p>Then I realized one thing:
    I had nothing to lose.</p><p>The worst that could happen would be that I got rejected.
    But I wouldn’t die. So, I went ahead and applied.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2142/1*8cPBViJqnZ6LdpRtpvKhFw.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Fingers crossed, I started re-watching several of the videos I
    had downloaded from <a href=\"https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/\">MIT
    OCW</a>. I also spent some nights watching some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX9wt5FWQUAAz4UrysqK9A/videos\">coding
    interview solution videos</a>. In the past, I had mostly been hired based on my
    strong portfolio and previous job experience, but I didn’t want to be caught off
    guard if they gave me a coding interview.</p><p>Well, long story short: after
    lots of preparation, answering some difficult questions, a phone interview, and
    some coding projects, I was accepted.</p><p>I couldn’t believe it. I was ecstatic.</p><p>Looking
    back at it, this was one of my best decisions.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*1E29yDhfRRk_xiqdjNygtA.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>Working at Dotlearn, I have had exponential growth in my career
    and have met with lots of awesome people from MIT, Harvard, and other great places.</p><p>From
    attending big events like the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/video/dot-learn-startup-battlefield-africa-2017/59df0c729e45105de569e2c1/\">Techcrunch

  :title: 10 Signs You Will Suck at Programming
  :content: "<p>More Stickers Doesn’t Make You More Better. — Photo by Tim Gouw on
    Unsplash</p><p>I often see questions on Reddit or Quora along the lines of “How
    do I know if I’ll succeed as a programmer?” <em>(In fact this post expands on
    an <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-signs-that-show-you-wont-succeed-as-a-programmer/answer/Jonathan-Bluks\">answer
    I gave on Quora a while back</a>.)</em> When someone is considering a career change,
    or is interested in software development and curious about what it takes, inevitably
    the question of programming comes up.</p><p>In fact, I think this is a major barrier
    to entry in people’s minds when they don’t have any formal training in computing.
    It’s natural to think that if you aren’t good at programming, then your desire
    is a non-starter. It’s kind of like if you want to be an actor and wonder if you’ll
    be good at acting.</p><p>As an Educator that teaches Full-Stack Web Development,
    I have taught many “first time programmers”. And the good news is that I have
    rarely found a student that couldn’t learn to program. I see it as a basic human
    skill, just like reading, writing, and arithmetic. Anyone can do it, it is part
    of our human capacities, but does need to be learned.</p><blockquote><p><em>Want
    to read this story later? Save it in <a href=\"https://usejournal.com/?utm_source=medium.com&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=noteworthy&utm_content=eid7\">Journal</a>.</em></p></blockquote><p>Over
    the past two years of teaching, I have witnessed various students struggle in
    the process, and some common themes that come up in their struggles. <em>If you
    look at this list and see them in yourself, rest assured, you will truly suck
    at programming</em> and should probably find something else to do with your time.
    But, if you are still committed to your goal of becoming a developer, you can
    easily face these issues and change.</p><blockquote><h1>Programming is a basic
    human skill, just like reading, writing and arithmetic. Anyone can learn to program
    with time and effort.</h1></blockquote><p>The following list will help you know
    if you will suck at programming — and what you can do about it if you want to
    change.</p><h2>1 | Lack of curiosity</h2><blockquote><h1>If you lack curiosity
    about computers and how technology works, you will never be successful as a programmer.</h1></blockquote><p>A
    fundamental requirement for learning is an active interest in the thing you are
    learning. If you do not possess a mind that is curious about technology, you will
    not have the energy it takes to persist in learning the broad and deep knowledge
    required to be a successful programmer.</p><p>In contrast, the world of technology
    is like a huge ocean of interesting domains, inter-connected ideas, and possibilities
    that can excite the imagination. It takes an inherent internal motivation to want
    to dive in and discover all that you can.</p><blockquote><p>*<em>Find Your Curiosity:
    *</em>Ask yourself if programming truly interests you. If your honest answer is
    that it doesn’t, go find something that you are interested in. Save yourself the
    time and energy. But if your answer is “Yes”, then push yourself find something
    new that you haven’t noticed before, recognize the vast ocean and dive a little
    deeper.</p></blockquote><h2>2 | Lack of autonomy and resourcefulness</h2><blockquote><h1>If
    you don’t develop the ability to solve problems for yourself, you will never be
    successful as a programmer.</h1></blockquote><p>Without a doubt, to be a successful
    developer, you have to be confident in your OWN ability to learn. This is actually
    a fundamental life skill — if you are are over the age of 18, nobody is obligated
    to teach you anything. That’s reality. It’s up to you to find the information
    and help that you need to learn what is important to you.</p><p>In the world of
    development, all the information you need is found in that magical place formerly
    known as the <em>Information Super Highway</em>. This massive library has one
    huge doorway: <a href=\"https://www.google.com\">Google</a>. Learning that you
    can simply type whatever you want into Google and get to the information you need
    is the first hurdle to cross when you want to learn the skills needed to be in
    technology.</p><p>In addition to being a good googler, all programming languages
    have documentation and specifications that are <strong>very</strong> explicit
    about how the language works. It’s like using a dictionary — when you see a word
    you don’t recognize, you look it up. The quickest, most reliable way to build
    your skill as a programmer is to simply read the documentation. It’s literally
    all there.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Use the Resources:</strong> Recognize that
    all the answers you need really are out there. When you have a question, force
    yourself to google it before asking someone else for the answer and check the
    documentation. Save the time of others for when you have tried and truly failed
    to find the answer you need.</p></blockquote><h2>3 | Lack of persistence in the
    face of a problem</h2><blockquote><h1>If you give up easily in the face of problems,
    you will never be successful as a programmer.</h1></blockquote><p>The essence
    of programming is solving problems. That’s the whole reason computers were invented!
    Whenever you begin working on a program you will encounter a whole “stack” of
    problems. And once you resolve a problem, there is almost always another problem
    right behind it. You <em>are</em> making progress, but there are always <em>new</em>
    problems to face.</p><p>Facing that stack of problems can be daunting and discouraging.
    If you feel like things should “just work”, then you won’t have the energy to
    persist as the problems continue and little by little knock down your emotional
    resolve. It’s literally your job to figure out why things aren’t working.</p><p>From
    my in-class experience, there are usually one or two students per class who seem
    to have knack for encountering more problems than other students — often quite
    random and obscure problems. I remind the student that the more problems they
    face upfront, the possibility of learning more deeply and thoroughly increases.
    If they can gain understanding through these problems, they will quickly find
    that they are more confident because they have faced and resolved more problems
    than the average student.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Patient Acceptance:</strong>
    You need to recognize that problems come with the territory and are not problems,
    but in fact challenges. Every challenge you face and overcome gives you deeper
    understanding and a better ability to face new challenges, and quickly resolve
    old ones.</p></blockquote><h2>4 | No feeling of success in overcoming a problem</h2><blockquote><h1>If
    you don’t feel a sense of excitement and accomplishment after solving a problem,
    you will never be successful as a programmer.</h1></blockquote><p>Related to the
    previous issue of giving up too easily is a lack of “good feelings” once you have
    successfully resolved a problem. When fixing bugs and issues becomes a treadmill
    that never seems to end, you lose touch with the excitement that comes in overcoming
    a problem.</p><p>There is actually a dopamine hit that you need when you overcome
    a problem. This is similar to the experience of completing a level in a video
    game, or solving a challenge like a crossword or sudoku. We all know that there
    is a good feeling that comes from persisting through a challenge and then finally
    winning at the end. But if you have lost the ability to feel those feelings, or
    never truly cared in the first place, you will not be able experience the joy
    that comes from programming. If you see programming as a grind where you just
    want to get a result as easily as you can, you will never truly be a successful
    programmer.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Celebrate Your Wins:</strong> Whenever you
    solve a problem that you struggled with, no matter how small, always take pride
    in your accomplishment, take a break and congratulate yourself for a job well
    done. Let the feeling of success sink in and energize you for the next problem
    you face.</p></blockquote><h2>5 | Impatient about learning and understanding</h2><blockquote><h1>If
    you are impatient about learning and expect to master everything quickly and effortlessly,
    you will never truly be successful at programming.</h1></blockquote><p>As humans
    we are limited creatures. Even though our world moves faster and faster, and computers
    are a big cause of that, we can only move as fast as we are able. Our brains work
    at a certain speed, and depending on our past, our beliefs, our emotional states,
    our health…we will all learn and integrate information at different speeds.</p><p>The
    world of technology is like a vast ocean. You will never get to the end of it,
    you will never get to a point where you are a master with nothing else to learn.
    If you let yourself get overwhelmed, you will always feel a pressure to “catch
    up” and feel that you never know enough. If you can’t accept what you know and
    then learn a little bit more, you will feel like you are getting nowhere, and
    give up.</p><p>Instead, you need to enjoy the journey of learning for itself.
    Every little bit of knowledge you gain, or new skill you gain needs to make you
    excited. Like solving problems, you need to let yourself feel the pride of recognizing
    that you have taken a step forward, even if it is a small one.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Acknowledge
    Your Progress:</strong> There is a lot to learn, and the journey of programming
    never ends. But the knowledge is cumulative, so take pride it what you do know,
    and trust that every effort you take in your learning will create a strong foundation
    of knowledge for wherever your career takes you.</p></blockquote><h2>6 | Getting
    bored/tired from thinking</h2><blockquote><h1>If you are lazy in your thinking
    and see concentrated, focused thinking as a chore, you will never truly be successful
    at programming.</h1></blockquote><p>Programming is a thinking activity. As humans
    we are really good at thinking, but the reality is that even though we naturally
    spend all day doing it, we are lazy in our thinking. The ability to maintain concentrated,
    focused effort on a single problem over a period time is difficult if you aren’t
    used to it.</p><p>Symptoms of this include staring blankly at the screen, feeling
    a cloud descend on your thoughts, procrastinating on a problem, flipping between
    browser tabs, and desperately scanning StackOverflow for “an answer”. These are
    signs that you have hit a mental limitation and need to find a way through.</p><p>While
    programming, you will get tired and thinking literally burns physical energy just
    like exercising our bodies. When you aren’t used to exerting the mental energy
    needed to it can feel difficult to stay focused. But it is just like going to
    the gym, the more that you do it, the stronger you will get.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Your
    Mind is a Muscle:</strong> Trust that your brain is like a muscle — as you use
    it, it gets better and more efficient in it’s thinking. As you put pieces together
    and develop mental concepts, it becomes much easier to discover solutions.</p></blockquote><h2>7
    | Inability to think for yourself</h2><blockquote><h1>If you expect others to
    think for you, and are unwilling to look at the details of your own situation,
    you will never be a truly successful programmer.</h1></blockquote><p>When you
    are learning something new, it is easy to feel like you lack the knowledge and
    experience to have your own opinions. Taking initiative or doing/saying the wrong
    thing seems risky.</p><p>There is an inherent fear we all have in being wrong.
    When that fear of being wrong inhibits your exploration and curiosity, you stifle
    the ability to develop true knowledge, knowledge that is gained from experience
    and “failure”. When you need to rely on the “guru’s” opinion, a popular blogger,
    a best practice, or the “textbook” answer, then you have not truly integrated
    a working knowledge of programming.</p><p>You need to develop you own opinions
    about what works and what doesn’t. You need to understand why you think your solution
    works, and what the benefits are. You need to developed a nuanced perspective
    that goes beyond what is obvious. You need to be able to “argue” your side, and
    then if you change, you can own the new perspective you have gained.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Think
    for yourself:</strong> Through your experience and critical thinking skills, develop
    your own perspectives. Make reasonable guesses, take a position, and be willing
    to change as new information comes to light.</p></blockquote><h2>8 | Rigid, narrow
    and/or disorganized thinking</h2><blockquote><h1>If you are rigid in your thinking,
    and you have difficulty keeping your code organized — and by extension your thoughts
    organized and focused, you will never be successful at programming.</h1></blockquote><p>There
    are two extremes that I sometimes see in students. The first is a rigid and narrow
    approach to thinking. This attitude refuses help, and despite feedback, doesn’t
    change. Things are seen from one perspective only, and suggestions are ignored.</p><p>A
    second extreme I see is disorganized thinking. Students seem to make things more
    complicated than necessary, their code is messy and hard to follow. They overthink
    problems and write 100 lines of code, when 10 would have been sufficient.</p><p>When
    these two mindsets are combined the result is an uptight approach to programming,
    like a brute force approach that leads to layers and layers of fixes and “hacks”.
    What is required is the ability to go back over the solution, reevaluate it, give
    up on the initial approach, and reorganize.</p><p>Not being able to see other
    possibilities or receive feedback inhibits the ability to grow and improve. Being
    disorganized slows you down and prevents you from seeing patterns that would otherwise
    be obvious. And the overall quality of your work is diminished.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Self
    Reflection:</strong> You need to take a step back, and look at the bigger picture
    of how you are approaching things. How can you do this better? Is there anything
    you can do to make your life easier? What are you missing that could help you?</p></blockquote><h2>9
    | Needing the “right” answer instead of recognizing a spectrum of “good” and “bad”
    answers</h2><blockquote><h1>If you see the end goal of programming as finding
    the right solution, rather than a spectrum of solutions, you will never truly
    be successful as a programmer.</h1></blockquote><p>When starting to learn the
    skills or programming, students often want to know whether what they have done
    is “right”. The answer is always “it depends.”</p><p>Computer Science is a science
    of evaluating tradeoffs. Given different sets of circumstances, which would be
    the better path? It all depends on the circumstances and goals. When you see programming
    as a test with either a right answer or wrong answer, you are losing sight of
    the bigger picture, and giving up your creativity. Any answer can be “right” if
    you can justify it given the circumstances.</p><p>The reality is that programming
    is more like writing poems or short stories (or potentially novels if the programs
    are large). There is an aesthetic and beauty that can be seen in your code, and
    sometimes it is only recognizable by you and other programmers. The reasons you
    decided on your solution, and the way you conceived of your answer is more important
    than the “right way” or the “wrong way”. Having the mind of an artist allows you
    to play with options and possibilities, rather than thinking there is only one
    way. That is the beauty of programming, there are many ways to solve a problem,
    and the consideration of different possibilities leads to a feeling about which
    way is best for the situation.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Get Creative:</strong>
    Recognize that there are numerous ways to solve a problem, and through experience
    and exposure, you will develop a nuanced understanding overtime about which solutions
    feel better than others. Looking at the big picture, imagining different possibilities
    and trusting your gut will lead to better solutions that are more satisfying.</p></blockquote><h2>10
    | Not paying careful attention to details</h2><blockquote><h1>If you gloss over
    details, and overlook little things, you will never be a truly successful programmer.</h1></blockquote><p>Computers
    are precise machines. When it comes to programming a computer, you need to provide
    the necessary commands <em>precisely</em> in the way a computer expects. If you
    don’t, nothing will work. There isn’t a middle ground where things mostly work
    — it either does or it doesn’t.</p><p>That means that when you are programming
    you have to have an eye for details. Every space, bracket, or semi-colon counts.
    When out of place, nothing will work. When the computer spits back an error message,
    you have to be able to look at that message and understand exactly what it is
    telling you. And the reality is that if you miss details like that, you could
    spend hours tracking down a problem that was literally the result of a typo.</p><p>As
    they say, the devil is in the details. And that is definitely true for programming.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Pay
    Attention to the Details:</strong> The details matter and you have to accept that.
    Once you do, you can begin to always be scanning your code for anything that is
    out of place. You can organize your code and use tools that help you identify
    issues quickly.</p></blockquote><h2>Bonus: Being Business-Minded</h2><p>This is
    a side observation that I have noticed — students who are particularly business-minded,
    are often focused on the outcome rather than process. They want to get a “working
    app” that will move them forward on their business idea, they want to “get to
    market first”, and they see the learning curve as a barrier to their goal of getting
    their business going.</p><p>In reflecting on students that were difficult to truly
    help grow as programmers, I found an impatience with the process inhibiting the
    learning needed to truly understand technology. They tend to see technology as
    a means to an end, rather than a legitimate domain of knowledge to be explored
    and enjoyed.</p><p>As a natural extension of this, I have found certain students
    that were more business inclined, and struggled with their learning, often quickly
    had freelance clients signed up for work that they didn’t actually have the skills
    do themselves! They would scramble to find resources/templates to get a project
    working for a client, or, outsource the work to someone else. <em>They truly sucked
    at programming, but were amazing at getting people to pay them to program!</em></p><p>So
    what I would add, is that students who desire to start businesses, are excellent
    at sales, networking, and business development may struggle more than others to
    learn the skill of programming. Their natural desire to create financial opportunities
    and connect people to solutions makes them impatient with the tedious details
    involved in programming.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>While programming can be a difficult
    skill to learn, it is certainly one that most people can learn. The above list
    contains attitudes and mindsets that get in the way, but most people can overcome
    them and develop a competency in the area of programming — if not mastery.</p><p>If
    you are interested in learning to program, I encourage you to begin the journey.
    Keep the above list in mind, and start exploring the many resources available
    online that can get you moving forward quickly. You won’t regret it.</p><p><em>Disclaimer:

  :title: Here are the best programming languages to learn in 2018
  :content: '<p>This is the definitive guide for anyone wanting to choose the right
    programming language career path in 2018.</p><p>And let me be clear about something:</p><p>This
    is <em>not</em> a “top hottest languages” post throwing around a bunch of names
    and buzzwords.</p><p><strong>This is an objective and practical review of the
    current state, tendencies, and safe near-future predictions of the IT industry
    at the start of 2018.</strong></p><p>It’s based on statistical data from various
    trusted sources and is the result of a two-week period of in-depth research.</p><p>The
    goal of this post is to help you make an informed decision about which languages
    the IT market is looking for in 2018. It’ll help you decide which niche is worth
    the time and effort to master, and which will help you start (or continue) a <a
    href="https://www.myfirstitjob.com/career-shift/">**successful and profitable
    career as a software developer</a>**.</p><p>When trying to decide which programming
    language makes the best career path, developers typically look for these four
    traits:</p><ol><li><p>High salary</p></li><li><p>Popularity — plenty of job openings,
    variety</p></li><li><p>Tendency to become more in-demand in the future</p></li><li><p>Preferably
    easy to learn and pleasant to work with</p></li></ol><p>For each language outlined
    in the list, you’ll see:</p><ol><li><p>A brief intro to get you familiar with
    the language, what types of career options it can offer, and what’s cool about
    it</p></li><li><p>Language popularity diagrams according to <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE</a>

    according to <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a></p></li><li><p>A
    short example code snippet to give you a visual idea of the language’s syntax</p></li></ol><p>At
    the end, I’ve included four lesser-known languages which gained rapid popularity
    in the past few years and are expected to be in very high demand for 2018.</p><p>Let’s
    dive right in with the number one pick.</p><h2>1. JavaScript</h2><p>JavaScript
    is the most popular language according to <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology-programming-languages">StackOverflow’s
    annual survey</a>, with 62.5% of respondents claiming to use it.</p><p>It’s undoubtedly
    the dominant language of the web and the growth of JavaScript over the past decade
    has been immense. Why? Just look around and count how many web-enabled devices
    you can see. Stack Overflow’s co-founder and popular programming figure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood">Jeff
    Atwood</a> famously <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-principle-of-least-power/">said:</a></p><blockquote><h1>Any
    application that can be written in JavaScript will eventually be written in JavaScript.</h1></blockquote><p>Having
    that in mind, it’s safe to say there will be no shortage of JavaScript opportunities
    in 2018 and beyond.</p><p>JavaScript knowledge feeds into plenty of front-end
    frameworks such as Angular, React, Ember, Backbone, and others, as well as the
    Node.js run-time environment, which allows you to run JavaScript on the backend
    with high efficiency.</p><p>Three of the top four <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology-frameworks-libraries-and-other-technologies">most
    popular frameworks</a> for 2017 according to StackOverflow are JavaScript-based.</p><p>If
    you enjoy immediately seeing the results of your work in action, for example making
    interactive web components, JavaScript is a good idea for you. Have in mind that
    a career in JavaScript implicitly means you should also be comfortable with HTML
    and CSS, which is basically what web pages are made of.</p><p>Tools like <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Apache
    Cordova</a> or <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>
    allow using JavaScript for mobile applications. It’s even possible to get into
    game development or desktop app development with projects like <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a>.</p><p>Let’s
    see the stats behind JavaScript being the #1 pick:</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/7b18ce7f1e39a87ec41266db77c32cb3"

    frameborder=0></iframe><h2>2. Swift</h2><p>Swift is a relatively new programming
    language released by Apple in 2014. This is a language for developing native iOS
    or macOS applications.</p><p>It is considered an improvement in terms of usability
    and performance compared to Objective-C — the language used for Apple’s iOS and
    macOS operating systems.</p><p>Swift is generally favored by developers, standing
    at #4 in the list of <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages">most
    loved languages</a> for 2017, after being <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2015#tech-super">#1
    in 2015</a>. Should you pick up a career with Swift, chances are you would enjoy
    it.</p><p>If you want to get into mobile development, you should definitely consider
    Swift as a high-paid career path. Generally, iOS apps have proven to be <a href="http://bgr.com/2016/07/20/ios-vs-android-developers-profits-app-store-google-play/">more
    profitable</a> than Android apps.</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/d255e66246e6b76752d80d2631d0d22b"

    frameborder=0></iframe><h2>3. Python</h2><p>Python is a general purpose language
    which you can find almost anywhere today. You’ll find it in web applications,
    desktop apps, network servers, machine learning, media tools and more.</p><p>It’s
    used by big players like NASA or Google, where the Python creator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido
    van Rossum</a> was employed for about 8 years writing mostly…Python.</p><p>Python
    code is neat, readable, and well-structured. Proper indentation is not just for
    beauty here — it determines code execution.</p><p>Python-based web development
    frameworks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)">Django</a>
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)">Flask</a> have
    been gaining more and more popularity. Also, the language is heavily equipped
    with quality machine learning and data analysis libraries like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scikit-learn">Scikit-learn</a>
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software)">Pandas</a>.</p><p>On
    the whole, career paths with Python are various and here to stay. It’s a good
    choice for beginner developers, as it’s high-level and easy to read and comprehend.</p><iframe

    frameborder=0></iframe><h2>4. Java</h2><p>Java is arguably the most popular programming
    language as 90% of the <a href="http://fortune.com/global500/list">Fortune 500</a>
    companies heavily use it. Its famous slogan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere">“write
    once, run anywhere”</a> captures one of the keys that makes Java so valuable —
    its powerful Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which makes it cross-platform compatible.</p><p>Popular
    career paths with Java are backend developer, big data developer, embedded systems
    engineer, or Android developer. Although not the most “trendy” language at the
    moment, Java is so heavily used that we can pretty much guarantee it won’t go
    anywhere in the next decade and beyond.</p><p>Because of this, you can be confident
    that there are plenty of Java job positions both in your city and remotely, which
    can’t be said for some of the less popular languages on this list. Thus, if you
    are comfortable with Java, it’s only a matter of time before you’ll find the right
    place.</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/8fc84ff244b7b3966761a8a452d58c17"

    frameborder=0></iframe><h2>5. C++</h2><p>C++ is a highly efficient and flexible
    language, first created back in 1985. It has remained in high demand due to its
    performance, reliability, and variety of contexts you can use it in.</p><p>Plenty
    of large systems have been created and maintained successfully using C++, including
    the likes of Microsoft, Oracle, PayPal, and Adobe.</p><p>A career with C++ typically
    involves developing desktop applications, especially for performance-intensive
    tasks. While rather complex, getting comfortable with C++ would give you a deeper
    understanding of how languages work, for example by giving facilities for low-level
    memory manipulation.</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/a7309699d7c768b1df38ba5b76a4e6ea"

    frameborder=0></iframe><h2>6. Ruby</h2><p>Ruby is one of the most loved programming
    languages around. It’s designed to be friendly and easy to use by developers,
    as even its own tagline is “<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">a programmer’s
    best friend</a>.”</p><p>Ruby is a high-level language which aims to achieve a
    lot with few lines of clean, readable code. This sometimes takes significant effort
    “under the hood,” which makes Ruby relatively slower in terms of efficiency compared
    to other popular languages — but it definitely boosts your productivity.</p><p>Well-written
    Ruby code almost looks like sentences written in plain English. It’s a great choice
    for the first language to learn, as beginners typically pick it up fast and enjoy
    it along the way.</p><p>Ruby is mostly used for its most popular framework — <a
    href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. Ruby on Rails is a web framework
    which encapsulates all of Ruby’s ideas into a powerful tool for the web. The great
    productivity achieved with Rails makes it a <a href="https://medium.com/@RubyGarage/what-are-the-benefits-of-using-ruby-on-rails-for-your-startup-f3d6f6b9938d">common
    choice for startups</a> who aim for a running start.</p><p>A career with Ruby
    on Rails is definitely a great choice as the framework is “<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#optimize-for-programmer-happiness">optimized
    for programmer happiness</a>” and is also well-paid. The only major drawback of
    picking up a career with Ruby is that the language is not quite as popular compared
    to the languages mentioned above. Thus, job openings with Ruby may be limited
    in some locations.</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/e426422ce2064298bd9b3282bd70e642"

    frameborder=0></iframe><h2>7. Rust</h2><p>Rust is sponsored by Mozilla and was
    voted <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">most
    liked by developers</a> for a second consecutive year in StackOverflow surveys.
    This is a relatively new language, first appearing in 2010, which already gained
    remarkable popularity and is expected to improve even more in the future.</p><p>Rust
    is a compiled language which is often compared to C both in terms of use cases
    and performance. The main difference is that Rust is memory safe. One of the most
    common faults you could find in C code are dangling pointers, buffer overflows,
    or any other kind of memory errors. Rust is created with the purpose of avoiding
    those — the language literally makes it <em>impossible</em> for you to make such
    errors as they are caught during compilation (before the code was ever run).</p><p>For
    a beginner, Rust might be a bit of a struggle to pick up as it insists on various
    rules to achieve the memory safety. However, experienced developers <a href="https://medium.com/mozilla-tech/why-rust-is-the-most-loved-language-by-developers-666add782563">love
    it</a>, and it’s quite possible that in the next few years Rust will be in very

    appearing in 2011, that immediately gained popularity.</p><p>Elixir was inspired
    by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)">Erlang</a>,
    a language developed back in the 1980s by Ericsson and stands as arguably one
    of the best tools for heavy concurrency. Elixir’s author José Valim himself <a
    href="http://www.creativedeletion.com/2015/04/19/elixir_next_language.html">said</a>
    that he liked everything about Erlang, but also saw room for improvement. The
    biggest drawback of Erlang for developers is the often quirky syntax and usability
    plus the lack of intuitive package management.</p><p>Thus, Elixir appears — combining
    aspects from Ruby, a highly developer-friendly language and ecosystem, with those
    from Erlang.</p><p>Elixir is mainly used for web development, and career options
    are typically well-paid but limited. The popularity of the language has been increasing
    year after year, so if your city has various IT companies around, Elixir developers
    may be highly sought after.</p><p>Salary-wise, Elixir is typically well-paid standing
    at <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology-top-paying-technologies-by-region">third

    and is one of the many attempts to “rewrite Java” while improving its drawbacks.
    Scala code is compiled to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p><p>We can
    safely agree that Scala is already a success given the fact that big companies
    like LinkedIn, Twitter, and The Guardian <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/1658">use
    it</a> in their codebases.</p><p>Scala has the reputation of being <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573899/why-is-scala-very-complex">a
    complex language</a> to learn for a junior developer. But those who make it past
    the learning curve probably enjoy a great career as open positions for Scala developers
    are definitely popping up more and more.</p><p>Scala ranks high in salary surveys,

    took the programming community a couple of decades to appreciate Python. But since

    will Python eventually be replaced by other languages, and why?</p><p>Putting
    an exact expiry date on Python would be so much speculation, it might as well
    pass as Science-Fiction. Instead, I will assess the virtues that are boosting
    Python’s popularity right now, and the weak points that will break it in the future.</p><h2>What
    makes Python popular right now</h2><p>Python’s success is reflected in the <a
    href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=r%2Cpython%2Cjavascript%2Cjava%2Cc%2B%2B%2Cc%23">Stack
    Overflow trends</a>, which measure the count of tags in posts on the platform.
    Given the size of StackOverflow, this is quite a good indicator for language popularity.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*itIT95KvtxA1H2bcPcXtlA.png" alt="Snapshot
    of tags on various programming languages on StackOverflow."><em>Snapshot of tags
    on various programming languages on StackOverflow.</em></p><p>While R has been
    plateauing over the last few years, and many other languages are on a steady decline,
    Python’s growth seems unstoppable. Almost 14% of all StackOverflow questions are
    tagged “python”, and the trend is going up. And there are several reasons for
    that.</p><h3>It’s old</h3><p>Python has been around since the nineties. That doesn’t
    only mean that it has had plenty of time to grow. It has also acquired a large
    and supportive community.</p><p>So if you have any issue while you’re coding in
    Python, the odds are high that you’ll be able to solve it with a single Google
    search. Simply because somebody will have already encountered your problem and
    written something helpful about it.</p><h3>It’s beginner-friendly</h3><p>It’s
    not only the fact that it has been around for decades, giving programmers the
    time to make brilliant tutorials. More than that, the syntax of Python is very
    human-readable.</p><p>For a start, there’s no need to specify the data type. You
    just declare a variable; Python will understand from the context whether it’s
    an integer, a float value, a boolean or something else. This is a huge edge for
    beginners. If you’ve ever had to program in C++, you know how frustrating it is
    your program won’t compile because you swapped a float for an integer.</p><p>And
    if you’ve ever had to read Python and C++ code side-by-side, you’ll know how understandable
    Python is. Even though C++ was designed with English in mind, it’s a rather bumpy
    read compared to Python code.<a href="https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/learning-python-from-zero-to-hero-8ceed48486d5"><strong>Learning
    Python: From Zero to Hero</strong><em>A quick and comprehensive guide for your
    first steps in Python.</em>medium.com</a></p><h3>It’s versatile</h3><p>Since Python
    has been around for so long, developers have made a package for every purpose.
    These days, you can find a package for almost everything.</p><p>Want to crunch
    numbers, vectors and matrices? <strong>NumPy</strong> is your guy. Want to do
    calculations for tech and engineering? Use <strong>SciPy</strong>. Want to go
    big in data manipulation and analysis? Give <strong>Pandas</strong> a go.Want
    to start out with Artificial Intelligence? Why not use <strong>Scikit-Learn</strong>.</p><p>Whichever
    computational task you’re trying to manage, chances are that there is a Python
    package for it out there. This makes Python stay on top of recent developments,
    can be seen from the surge in Machine Learning over the past few years.</p><h2>Downsides
    of Python — and whether they’ll be fatal</h2><p>Based on the previous elaborations,
    you could imagine that Python will stay on top of sh*t for ages to come. But like
    every technology, Python has its weaknesses. I will go through the most important
    flaws, one by one, and assess whether these are fatal or not.</p><h3>Speed</h3><p>Python
    is slow. Like, really slow. On average, you’ll need about 2–10 times longer to
    complete a task with Python than with any other language.</p><p>There are <a href="https://hackernoon.com/why-is-python-so-slow-e5074b6fe55b">various
    reasons</a> for that. One of them is that it’s dynamically typed — remember that
    you don’t need to specify data types like in other languages. This means that
    a lot of memory needs to be used, because the program needs to reserve enough
    space for each variable that it works in any case. And lots of memory usage translates
    to lots of computing time.</p><p>Another reason is that Python can only execute
    one task at a time. This is a consequence of flexible datatypes — Python needs
    to make sure each variable has only one datatype, and parallel processes could
    mess that up.</p><p>In comparison, your average web browser can run a dozen different
    threads at once. And there are some other theories around, too.</p><p>But at the
    end of the day, none of the speed issues matter. Computers and servers have gotten
    so cheap that we’re talking about fractions of seconds. And the end user doesn’t
    really care whether their app loads in 0.001 or 0.01 seconds.<a href="https://medium.com/@trungluongquang/why-python-is-popular-despite-being-super-slow-83a8320412a9"><strong>Why
    Python is Popular Despite Being (Super) Slow</strong>*A beautiful explanation
    of the irrelevance of speed issues in Python by Bobby. *medium.com</a></p><h3>Scope</h3><p>Originally,
    Python was <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-and-dynamic-scoping/">dynamically
    scoped</a>. This basically means that, to evaluate an expression, a compiler first
    searches the current block and then successively all the calling functions.</p><p>The
    problem with dynamic scoping is that every expression needs to be tested in every
    possible context — which is tedious. That’s why most modern programming languages
    use static scoping.</p><p>Python tried to transition to static scoping, but <a
    href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-main-weaknesses-of-Python-as-a-programming-language">messed
    it up</a>. Usually, inner scopes — for example functions within functions — would
    be able to see <em>and</em> change outer scopes. In Python, inner scopes can only
    see outer scopes, but not change them. This leads to a lot of confusion.</p><h3>Lambdas</h3><p>Despite
    all of the flexibility within Python, the usage of Lambdas is rather restrictive.
    Lambdas can only be expressions in Python, and not be statements.</p><p>On the
    other hand, variable declarations and statements are always statements. This means
    that Lambdas cannot be used for them.</p><p>This distinction between expressions
    and statements is rather arbitrary, and doesn’t occur in other languages.</p><p><img

    Python, you use whitespaces and indentations to indicate different levels of code.
    This makes it optically appealing and intuitive to understand.</p><p>Other languages,
    for example C++, rely more on braces and semicolons. While this might not be visually
    appealing and beginner-friendly, it makes the code a lot more maintainable. For
    bigger projects, this is a lot more useful.</p><p>Newer languages like Haskell
    solve this problem: They rely on whitespaces, but offer an alternative syntax
    for those who wish to go without.</p><h3>Mobile Development</h3><p>As we’re witnessing
    the shift from desktop to smartphone, it’s clear that we need robust languages
    to build mobile software.</p><p>But not many mobile apps are being developed with
    Python. That doesn’t mean that it can’t be done — there is a Python package called
    Kivy for this purpose.</p><p>But Python wasn’t made with mobile in mind. So even
    though it might produce passable results for basic tasks, your best bet is to
    use a language that was created for mobile app development. Some widely used programming
    frameworks for mobile include React Native, Flutter, Iconic, and Cordova.</p><p>To
    be clear, laptops and desktop computers should be around for many years to come.
    But since mobile has long surpassed desktop traffic, it’s safe to say that learning
    Python is not enough to become a seasoned all-round developer.</p><h3>Runtime
    Errors</h3><p>A Python script isn’t compiled first and then executed. Instead,
    it compiles every time you execute it, so any coding error manifests itself at
    runtime. This leads to poor performance, time consumption, and the need for a
    lot of tests. Like, <em>a lot</em> of tests.</p><p>This is great for beginners
    since testing teaches them a lot. But for seasoned developers, having to debug
    a complex program in Python makes them go awry. This lack of performance is the
    biggest factor that sets a timestamp on Python.<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/top-7-modern-programming-language-to-learn-now-156863bd1eec"><strong>Top
    7 Modern programming languages to learn now</strong><em>How Rust, Go, Kotlin,
    TypeScript, Swift, Dart, Julia can boost your career and improve your software
    development skills</em>towardsdatascience.com</a></p><h2>What could replace Python
    in the future — and when</h2><p>There are a few new competitors on the market
    of programming languages:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rust</strong> offers the same
    kind of safety that Python has — no variable can accidentally be overwritten.
    But it solves the performance issue with the concept of ownership and borrowing.
    It is also the most-loved programming language of the last few years, according
    to <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology">StackOverflow
    Insights</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Go</strong> is great for beginners like Python.
    And it is so simple that it’s even easier to maintain the code. Fun point: Go
    developers are among the <a href="https://insights.dice.com/2019/10/30/top-programming-languages-that-will-get-you-paid/">highest-paid
    programmers</a> on the market.</p></li><li><p><strong>Julia</strong> is a very
    new language that competes head-on with Python. It fills the gap of large-scale
    technical computations: Usually, one would have used Python or Matlab, and patched
    the whole thing up with C++ libraries, which are necessary at a large scale. Now,
    one can use Julia instead of juggling with two languages.</p></li></ul><p>While
    there are other languages on the market, Rust, Go, and Julia are the ones that
    fix weak patches of Python. All of these languages excel in yet-to-come technologies,
    most notably in Artificial Intelligence. While their market share is still small,
    as reflected in the number of StackOverflow tags, the trend for all of them is
    clear: upwards.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ectt9Nl3dlnhGXKpHBmLuA.png"
    alt="Snapshot of tags on various programming languages on StackOverflow."><em>Snapshot

    ubiquitous popularity of Python at the moment, it will surely take half a decade,
    maybe even a whole, for any of these new languages to replace it.</p><p>Which
    of the languages it will be — Rust, Go, Julia, or a new language of the future
    — is hard to say at this point. But given the performance issues that are fundamental
    in the architecture of Python, one will inevitably take its spot.</p>'

  :title: 'Master the JavaScript Interview: What is Functional Programming?'
  :content: '<p>Structure Synth — Orihaus (CC BY 2.0)</p><blockquote><p>“Master the
    JavaScript Interview” is a series of posts designed to prepare candidates for
    common questions they are likely to encounter when applying for a mid to senior-level
    JavaScript position. These are questions I frequently use in real interviews.</p></blockquote><p>Functional
    programming has become a really hot topic in the JavaScript world. Just a few
    years ago, few JavaScript programmers even knew what functional programming is,
    but every large application codebase I’ve seen in the past 3 years makes heavy
    use of functional programming ideas.</p><p><strong>Functional programming</strong>
    (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing <strong>pure
    functions</strong>, avoiding <strong>shared state,</strong> <strong>mutable data,
    *<em>and *</em>side-effects</strong>. Functional programming is <strong>declarative</strong>
    rather than <strong>imperative</strong>, and application state flows through pure
    functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state
    is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.</p><p>Functional programming
    is a <strong>programming paradigm</strong>, meaning that it is a way of thinking
    about software construction based on some fundamental, defining principles (listed
    above). Other examples of programming paradigms include object oriented programming
    and procedural programming.</p><p>Functional code tends to be more concise, more
    predictable, and easier to test than imperative or object oriented code — but
    if you’re unfamiliar with it and the common patterns associated with it, functional
    code can also seem a lot more dense, and the related literature can be impenetrable
    to newcomers.</p><p>If you start googling functional programming terms, you’re
    going to quickly hit a brick wall of academic lingo that can be very intimidating
    for beginners. To say it has a learning curve is a serious understatement. But
    if you’ve been programming in JavaScript for a while, chances are good that you’ve
    used a lot of functional programming concepts &amp; utilities in your real software.</p><blockquote><h1>Don’t
    let all the new words scare you away. It’s a lot easier than it sounds.</h1></blockquote><p>The
    hardest part is wrapping your head around all the unfamiliar vocabulary. There
    are a lot of ideas in the innocent looking definition above which all need to
    be understood before you can begin to grasp the meaning of functional programming:</p><ul><li><p>Pure
    functions</p></li><li><p>Function composition</p></li><li><p>Avoid shared state</p></li><li><p>Avoid
    mutating state</p></li><li><p>Avoid side effects</p></li></ul><p>In other words,
    if you want to know what functional programming means in practice, you have to
    start with an understanding of those core concepts.</p><p>A <strong>pure function</strong>
    is a function which:</p><ul><li><p>Given the same inputs, always returns the same
    output, and</p></li><li><p>Has no side-effects</p></li></ul><p>Pure functions
    have lots of properties that are important in functional programming, including
    <strong>referential transparency</strong> (you can replace a function call with
    its resulting value without changing the meaning of the program). Read <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976">“What
    is a Pure Function?”</a> for more details.</p><p>*<em>Function composition *</em>is
    the process of combining two or more functions in order to produce a new function
    or perform some computation. For example, the composition f . g (the dot means
    “composed with”) is equivalent to f(g(x)) in JavaScript. Understanding function
    composition is an important step towards understanding how software is constructed
    using the functional programming. Read <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-function-composition-20dfb109a1a0">“What
    is Function Composition?”</a> for more.</p><h2>Shared State</h2><p><strong>Shared
    state</strong> is any variable, object, or memory space that exists in a shared
    scope, or as the property of an object being passed between scopes. A shared scope
    can include global scope or closure scopes. Often, in object oriented programming,
    objects are shared between scopes by adding properties to other objects.</p><p>For
    example, a computer game might have a master game object, with characters and
    game items stored as properties owned by that object. Functional programming avoids
    shared state — instead relying on immutable data structures and pure calculations
    to derive new data from existing data. For more details on how functional software
    might handle application state, see <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-tips-for-better-redux-architecture-69250425af44">“10
    Tips for Better Redux Architecture”</a>.</p><p>The problem with shared state is
    that in order to understand the effects of a function, you have to know the entire
    history of every shared variable that the function uses or affects.</p><p>Imagine
    you have a user object which needs saving. Your saveUser() function makes a request
    to an API on the server. While that’s happening, the user changes their profile
    picture with updateAvatar() and triggers another saveUser() request. On save,
    the server sends back a canonical user object that should replace whatever is
    in memory in order to sync up with changes that happen on the server or in response
    to other API calls.</p><p>Unfortunately, the second response gets received before
    the first response, so when the first (now outdated) response gets returned, the
    new profile pic gets wiped out in memory and replaced with the old one. This is
    an example of a race condition — a very common bug associated with shared state.</p><p>Another
    common problem associated with shared state is that changing the order in which
    functions are called can cause a cascade of failures because functions which act
    on shared state are timing dependent:</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/44eda3fa070f0177287ce13a6999350e"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>When you avoid shared state, the timing and order of
    function calls don’t change the result of calling the function. With pure functions,
    given the same input, you’ll always get the same output. This makes function calls
    completely independent of other function calls, which can radically simplify changes
    and refactoring. A change in one function, or the timing of a function call won’t
    ripple out and break other parts of the program.</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/2f764b00e9c364e6e3fbf2b20460819b"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>In the example above, we use Object.assign() and pass
    in an empty object as the first parameter to copy the properties of x instead
    of mutating it in place. In this case, it would have been equivalent to simply
    create a new object from scratch, without Object.assign(), but this is a common
    pattern in JavaScript to create copies of existing state instead of using mutations,
    which we demonstrated in the first example.</p><p>If you look closely at the console.log()
    statements in this example, you should notice something I’ve mentioned already:
    function composition. Recall from earlier, function composition looks like this:
    f(g(x)). In this case, we replace f() and g() with x1() and x2() for the composition:
    x1 . x2.</p><p>Of course, if you change the order of the composition, the output
    will change. Order of operations still matters. f(g(x)) is not always equal to
    g(f(x)), but what doesn’t matter anymore is what happens to variables outside
    the function — and that’s a big deal. With impure functions, it’s impossible to
    fully understand what a function does unless you know the entire history of every
    variable that the function uses or affects.</p><p>Remove function call timing
    dependency, and you eliminate an entire class of potential bugs.</p><h2>Immutability</h2><p>An
    <strong>immutable</strong> object is an object that can’t be modified after it’s
    created. Conversely, a <strong>mutable</strong> object is any object which can
    be modified after it’s created.</p><p>Immutability is a central concept of functional
    programming because without it, the data flow in your program is lossy. State
    history is abandoned, and strange bugs can creep into your software. For more
    on the significance of immutability, see <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-dao-of-immutability-9f91a70c88cd">“The
    Dao of Immutability.”</a></p><p>In JavaScript, it’s important not to confuse const,
    with immutability. const creates a variable name binding which can’t be reassigned
    after creation. const does not create immutable objects. You can’t change the
    object that the binding refers to, but you can still change the properties of
    the object, which means that bindings created with const are mutable, not immutable.</p><p>Immutable
    objects can’t be changed at all. You can make a value truly immutable by deep
    freezing the object. JavaScript has a method that freezes an object one-level
    deep:</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/e16c2f595099b8998995285f687464aa"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>But frozen objects are only superficially immutable.
    For example, the following object is mutable:</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/dfefaeedf84262edb46cf1304f920d52"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>As you can see, the top level primitive properties of
    a frozen object can’t change, but any property which is also an object (including
    arrays, etc…) can still be mutated — so even frozen objects are not immutable
    unless you walk the whole object tree and freeze every object property.</p><p>In
    many functional programming languages, there are special immutable data structures
    called <strong>trie data structures</strong> (pronounced “tree”) which are effectively
    deep frozen — meaning that no property can change, regardless of the level of
    the property in the object hierarchy.</p><p>Tries use <strong>structural sharing</strong>
    to share reference memory locations for all the parts of the object which are
    unchanged after an object has been copied by an operator, which uses less memory,
    and enables significant performance improvements for some kinds of operations.</p><p>For
    example, you can use identity comparisons at the root of an object tree for comparisons.
    If the identity is the same, you don’t have to walk the whole tree checking for
    differences.</p><p>There are several libraries in JavaScript which take advantage
    of tries, including <a href="https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js">Immutable.js</a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/swannodette/mori">Mori</a>.</p><p>I have experimented
    with both, and tend to use Immutable.js in large projects that require significant
    amounts of immutable state. For more on that, see <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-tips-for-better-redux-architecture-69250425af44">“10
    Tips for Better Redux Architecture”</a>.</p><h2>Side Effects</h2><p>A side effect
    is any application state change that is observable outside the called function
    other than its return value. Side effects include:</p><ul><li><p>Modifying any
    external variable or object property (e.g., a global variable, or a variable in
    the parent function scope chain)</p></li><li><p>Logging to the console</p></li><li><p>Writing
    to the screen</p></li><li><p>Writing to a file</p></li><li><p>Writing to the network</p></li><li><p>Triggering
    any external process</p></li><li><p>Calling any other functions with side-effects</p></li></ul><p>Side
    effects are mostly avoided in functional programming, which makes the effects
    of a program much easier to understand, and much easier to test.</p><p>Haskell
    and other functional languages frequently isolate and encapsulate side effects
    from pure functions using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">**monads</a>**.
    The topic of monads is deep enough to write a book on, so we’ll save that for
    later.</p><p>What you do need to know right now is that side-effect actions need
    to be isolated from the rest of your software. If you keep your side effects separate
    from the rest of your program logic, your software will be much easier to extend,
    refactor, debug, test, and maintain.</p><p>This is the reason that most front-end
    frameworks encourage users to manage state and component rendering in separate,
    loosely coupled modules.</p><h2>Reusability Through Higher Order Functions</h2><p>Functional
    programming tends to reuse a common set of functional utilities to process data.
    Object oriented programming tends to colocate methods and data in objects. Those
    colocated methods can only operate on the type of data they were designed to operate
    on, and often only the data contained in that specific object instance.</p><p>In
    functional programming, any type of data is fair game. The same map() utility
    can map over objects, strings, numbers, or any other data type because it takes
    a function as an argument which appropriately handles the given data type. FP
    pulls off its generic utility trickery using <strong>higher order functions</strong>.</p><p>JavaScript
    has <strong>first class functions</strong>, which allows us to treat functions
    as data — assign them to variables, pass them to other functions, return them
    from functions, etc…</p><p>A <strong>higher order function</strong> is any function
    which takes a function as an argument, returns a function, or both. Higher order
    functions are often used to:</p><ul><li><p>Abstract or isolate actions, effects,
    or async flow control using callback functions, promises, monads, etc…</p></li><li><p>Create
    utilities which can act on a wide variety of data types</p></li><li><p>Partially
    apply a function to its arguments or create a curried function for the purpose
    of reuse or function composition</p></li><li><p>Take a list of functions and return
    some composition of those input functions</p></li></ul><h3>Containers, Functors,
    Lists, and Streams</h3><p>A functor is something that can be mapped over. In other
    words, it’s a container which has an interface which can be used to apply a function
    to the values inside it. When you see the word functor, you should think “mappable”.</p><p>Earlier
    we learned that the same map() utility can act on a variety of data types. It
    does that by lifting the mapping operation to work with a functor API. The important
    flow control operations used by map() take advantage of that interface. In the
    case of Array.prototype.map(), the container is an array, but other data structures
    can be functors, too — as long as they supply the mapping API.</p><p>Let’s look
    at how Array.prototype.map() allows you to abstract the data type from the mapping
    utility to make map() usable with any data type. We’ll create a simple double()
    mapping that simply multiplies any passed in values by 2:</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/a3824f6547f5d0152b46bd00928dc4a9"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>What if we want to operate on targets in a game to double
    the number of points they award? All we have to do is make a subtle change to
    the double() function that we pass into map(), and everything still works:</p><iframe
    src="https://medium.com/media/16f1dd07395f81108a65ada6058d2067" frameborder=0></iframe><p>The
    concept of using abstractions like functors &amp; higher order functions in order
    to use generic utility functions to manipulate any number of different data types
    is important in functional programming. You’ll see a similar concept applied in
    <a href="https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land">all sorts of different ways</a>.</p><blockquote><h1>“A
    list expressed over time is a stream.”</h1></blockquote><p>All you need to understand
    for now is that arrays and functors are not the only way this concept of containers
    and values in containers applies. For example, an array is just a list of things.
    A list expressed over time is a stream — so you can apply the same kinds of utilities
    to process streams of incoming events — something that you’ll see a lot when you
    start building real software with FP.</p><h2>Declarative vs Imperative</h2><p>Functional
    programming is a declarative paradigm, meaning that the program logic is expressed
    without explicitly describing the flow control.</p><p><strong>Imperative</strong>
    programs spend lines of code describing the specific steps used to achieve the
    desired results — the <strong>flow control: How</strong> to do things.</p><p><strong>Declarative</strong>
    programs abstract the flow control process, and instead spend lines of code describing
    the <strong>data flow: What</strong> to do. The <em>how</em> gets abstracted away.</p><p>For
    example, this <strong>imperative</strong> mapping takes an array of numbers and
    returns a new array with each number multiplied by 2:</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/9299c4163d3588fad5c377bb3fa098ad"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>This <strong>declarative</strong> mapping does the same
    thing, but abstracts the flow control away using the functional Array.prototype.map()
    utility, which allows you to more clearly express the flow of data:</p><iframe
    src="https://medium.com/media/04b319f431432d8cb20805628854e978" frameborder=0></iframe><p><strong>Imperative</strong>
    code frequently utilizes statements. A <strong>statement</strong> is a piece of
    code which performs some action. Examples of commonly used statements include
    for, if, switch, throw, etc…</p><p><strong>Declarative</strong> code relies more
    on expressions. An <strong>expression</strong> is a piece of code which evaluates
    to some value. Expressions are usually some combination of function calls, values,
    and operators which are evaluated to produce the resulting value.</p><p>These
    are all examples of expressions:</p><pre><code>2 * 2doubleMap([2, 3, 4])Math.max(4,
    3, 2)</code></pre><p>Usually in code, you’ll see expressions being assigned to
    an identifier, returned from functions, or passed into a function. Before being
    assigned, returned, or passed, the expression is first evaluated, and the resulting
    value is used.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Functional programming favors:</p><ul><li><p>Pure
    functions instead of shared state &amp; side effects</p></li><li><p>Immutability
    over mutable data</p></li><li><p>Function composition over imperative flow control</p></li><li><p>Lots
    of generic, reusable utilities that use higher order functions to act on many
    data types instead of methods that only operate on their colocated data</p></li><li><p>Declarative
    rather than imperative code (what to do, rather than how to do it)</p></li><li><p>Expressions
    over statements</p></li><li><p>Containers &amp; higher order functions over ad-hoc
    polymorphism</p></li></ul><h2>Homework</h2><p>Learn &amp; practice this core group
    of functional array extras:</p><ul><li><p>.map()</p></li><li><p>.filter()</p></li><li><p>.reduce()</p></li></ul><p>Use

  :title: How to prepare for competitive programming ?
  :content: '<p>This is how I won 3 out of 4 Gold medals in the Computing Olympiad.</p><p><strong>Later
    edit:</strong> I’ve qualified to the World Finals of Google HashCode 2017, the
    largest algorithmic competition organised by Google.</p><p>I started learning
    C++ from scratch during my first year of Highschool. I knew nothing about programming,
    algorithms or data structures. Seven months after I had written my first line
    of code, the Computing Olympiad was knocking at the door. And it was the perfect
    time to see if my learning style was worth 5 cents.</p><blockquote><p><em>After
    2 days of competition, the results came: I’ve won the Gold medal.</em></p></blockquote><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6912/1*Bjq57vVCpcM3i3zVu56KlA.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>I
    was shocked because I had surpassed competitors with 5 years of experience. I
    knew I had worked hard, but this achievement exceeded my expectations. The programming
    contest matched me perfectly and I went all-in in this field.</p><h2>I know what
    brought me success and I want to share this with you.</h2><h3>What language should
    you choose?</h3><ol><li><p>C++ — Highly recommended! It’s very fast. Implementing
    different algorithms takes little time because of STL. C++ is accepted in all
    competitions. <em>I’ve been using it since my first line of code.</em></p></li><li><p>C
    — Go and learn C++ because of STL. If you have knowledge of C, you are ready to
    code in C++ as well.</p></li><li><p>JAVA — It’s slow. But it has Big Integer class,
    even if there are very few problems that require using it. If the time limit is
    tight, you will get Time limit exceeded. Java is not accepted in all competitions.</p></li></ol><h3>Where
    can you practice?</h3><p>I recommend <a href="http://www.spoj.com/">Sphere Online
    Judge (SPOJ)</a>. It’s effective in terms of quality and quantity. Editorials
    and solutions are available online if you get stuck while solving problems. Supporting
    websites <a href="http://spojtoolkit.com/">SPOJ Toolkit</a> and <a href="http://problemclassifier.appspot.com/">Problem
    classifier for SPOJ.pl</a>.</p><h2>Firstly, you have to master the basics.</h2><p>After
    you get used to the language’s syntax it’s time to solve some problems. Start
    with simple ones that require implementation skills. In this stage, your goal
    is to define your coding style. Maybe you like to write with lots of spaces, maybe
    not. Maybe you put the braces on the same line with the ‘if’ statement, maybe
    not.</p><blockquote><h1>You have to find your coding style because it’s yours.</h1></blockquote><p>And
    keep in mind these two principles while developing your coding style.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Easy
    to implement.</strong> You should feel comfortable implementing the solution you
    came up with. Why? Because during the competition, the last thing you want to
    happen is to get lost in your code. It’s always better to think 5 more minutes
    about implementation rather than spending 10 more minutes doing it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Easy
    to read.</strong> This means ‘Easy to debug’. Let’s face it, we both know that
    bugs appear all the time. Do you know that feeling when you have 10 minutes left
    and you don’t find that fucking bug? Yes, you do. To solve that you have to write
    legible code. So when you start debugging, the code would feel natural and simple
    to follow.</p></li></ul><p><a href="https://github.com/margiki/Just-to-share-code/blob/master/Biconnected%20components">Here</a>
    is my coding style.</p><h3>How to boost your implementation skills?</h3><p><em>Practice,
    practice and more practice.</em> I recommend you to work the first 250 most solved
    problem on <a href="http://www.spoj.com/problems/classical/sort=-6,start=0">SPOJ</a>.
    Solve them in that exact order. And think of the solution for at least one hour.</p><p>Don’t
    say ‘This problem is too hard for me, I will try the next one’. <strong>That’s
    the loser mentality.</strong></p><p>Take a piece of paper and a pencil and try
    to think. In this way, you will probably find the solution, but for sure you will
    develop algorithmic thinking. If you don’t find the solution in one hour, then
    you can take a look on the forum or editorials to see the solution.</p><p>The
    results of this approach? Fast implementation. And learning classic problems &amp;
    algorithms.</p><h2>Secondly, you have to master Algorithms and Data structures.</h2><p>*Follow
    a hierarchical approach. *Did you start running without knowing how to walk? No.
    Can you build a skyscraper without a strong foundation? Again, no.</p><blockquote><h1>This
    means that you can’t burn steps in your learning path. Or if you do, you’ll remain
    with knowledge gaps that will deepen as the time goes.</h1></blockquote><h3>Start
    with fundamental Algorithms and Data structures.</h3><p>It’s hard to start. Probably
    because you don’t know what to learn first. That’s why I’ve created an <a href="http://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-algorithms-and-data-structures-in-c/">Algorithms
    and Data structures video course</a>. *<em>I’ve made this course in the way I
    wish I had been taught. *</em>The response was incredible, 3000+ students from
    100+ countries had joined during the first month.</p><p><em>If you work easy problems,
    you will never become better.</em></p><p>The most effective way to find what you
    don’t know is to actually encounter it. It’s what happened to me. I’ve learned
    many new techniques, that I had never heard of before, by choosing a hard problem.</p><p>*From
    every 3 problems you solve, one should teach you something new. *If not, choose
    them more carefully. Choose harder problems!</p><p>After you finish those 250
    problems from SPOJ, you will have an overview of the main topics of competitive
    programming. By deeply understanding the logic behind basic algorithms, high-level
    algorithms will seem easy to understand. So you can rapidly leverage your knowledge.</p><h3>Now
    dig deeper into every major topic.</h3><p><a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-algorithms-and-data-structures-for-competitive-programming/#algo4">Here</a>
    is an tremendous resource with Top 10 Algorithms and Data structures in every
    topic. After those 250 problems from SPOJ, you will know many from that list.
    But there are still many that you have never heard about. So start learning them
    in ascending order.</p><blockquote><h1>If you don’t strengthen your knowledge
    after you learn something new, you will forget it.</h1></blockquote><p>I recommend
    that after you learn a new algorithm to practice 2–3 problems using it. Search
    the tag of the algorithm on SPOJ and you’ll find problems that require it. Work
    them before anything else.</p><blockquote><h1>Understand Dynamic programming because
    it will make you win.</h1></blockquote><p>From my experience, in every contest
    is at least one <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/dynamic-programming-from-novice-to-advanced/">Dynamic
    programming</a> problem. Many people get a headache when they hear DP because
    they don’t understand it.</p><blockquote><p><em>And it’s a good thing. Because
    if you truly understand DP, you will win.</em></p></blockquote><p>I like DP, it’s
    my favourite topic. And here is DP’s secret: think globally optimal, not just
    locally. You have to break the problem into simpler subproblems, solving each
    of them just once, and building the solution combining these solved subproblems.
    The opposite of DP is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm">greedy
    algorithm</a> because the latter picks the locally optimal choice at each step.
    And locally optimal choices may result in a bad global solution.</p><p>When learning
    new concepts, check <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/">TopCoder
    tutorials</a>. They are very detailed and easy-to-follow. I’ve truly understood
    <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/binary-indexed-trees/">Binary
    Indexed Trees </a>from there.</p><h3>Work hard.</h3><p>Have you ever heard of
    athletes who win the Olympics without years of practice? I haven’t.</p><p>Every
    year, the preparation for the Computing Olympiad started in September and ended
    in April.</p><blockquote><h1>Every single day in these 8 months I was practicing
    5 hours.</h1></blockquote><p>And yes, I spent these 5 hours just solving Algorithmic
    problems. I remember days when I spent even 8 or 10 hours practising. Why? Because
    I was passionate about it. Every day after coming back home from school I went
    straight to my bedroom and started solving a new problem. Or learning a new algorithm
    requisite for that problem.</p><p>If you want to win, you must do the same. Take
    a problem and stick with it. Think about it during your daily routine. Like on
    your way to the supermarket, or while driving.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*ZM6yL02bMk710YKw.jpg"
    alt=""></p><p>Do you know that while sleeping, your brain is defragmenting the
    information gathered in that day? It’s like putting the books in alphabetical
    order on a bookshelf. Basically, your brain thinks at different problems that
    you have encountered.</p><p><em>Here is how you can take advantage of this.</em>
    Before you go to sleep read a hard problem and keep in mind what it requires.
    At this point, you don’t have to find the solution. Then you go to sleep and your
    brain mechanism starts to process that problem. When you wake up you will be surprised:
    you’ve found the solution while sleeping.</p><p>Try it by yourself. It feels like
    magic.</p><h2><strong>I started a Vlog</strong></h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2038/1*4W7TLsTq6yu3occTpRjSsw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>This short paragraph is not related with Competitive Programming.
    I just wanted to let you know that if you are in your 20s and you find interesting
    how I see the world, I am doing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPcssmsRLxVL1yFS2SZGKTA">Youtube
    vlog</a>. I talk about the world, life and Computer Science.</p><h3>Work smart.</h3><p><em>This
    is the secret to succeeding. You need targets.</em></p><p>We are humans and we
    like to <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html">procrastinate</a>.
    This means postponing things that you need to do right now. It’s always handier
    to watch Netflix rather than working DP problems. You know that, and you need
    to fix that.</p><h3>How can you beat procrastination?</h3><p>*By assuming targets.
    *You will always find interesting problems, from where you can learn something
    new (check the resources I gave you above). But those problems must be solved,
    not just read.</p><p>So here’s how I overcame procrastination. I’ve made a paper
    calendar and I filled it with problems I wanted to solve each day. And I have

    alt=""></p><p>In this way, I was always motivated to finish the problems and find
    new ones to fill the calendar in the following days. It’s a rewarding feeling
    to cut problems when you solve them. I know you like that too.</p><p>*Do your
    own paper calendar. *Don’t make another checklist on your phone, that you won’t
    care about tomorrow.</p><h3>How to debug effectively?</h3><p>Do you want to become
    a Pro? If so, you need to ‘debug in your mind’.</p><p>It’s by far the most efficient
    debugging technique I know because it doesn’t require a debugger at all. Your
    brain explores multiple code paths at the same time and gives you a much broader
    perspective of the code, compared with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTiI7wrce2Y">classic
    debugger</a>.</p><p>It’s similar to grandmasters’ ability to play chess and think
    3 moves in advance.</p><p>I use this technique exclusively as my initial line
    of defence, followed by using an actual debugger in the last instance.</p><p>To
    learn to ‘debug in your mind’ you need to practice. When you submit a problem
    and receive ‘Wrong answer’ don’t go straight to the debugger button. Instead,
    start to read the code and think ‘What happens on this line?’, ‘How does this
    ‘if’ statement affect the program?’, ‘When it exits the loop, what is the value
    of the iterator?’.</p><p>In this way you think on your own. Over time, you’ll
    start debugging in real-time as you write the code.</p><h3><strong>Found this

    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4000/1*SNOF9EOlDnAViwEZAoFwmg.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>The
    main thing that was bothering me while I was just starting my coding career was
    the language/technology choice. What should I learn, where should I start? What
    should I know to get my first job as a programmer? Back then (almost 10 years
    now) there wasn’t Coursera, or Udemy or <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">SoloLearn</a>.
    I wasn’t able to figure out the exact direction, the complete path leading to
    a successful job myself. The highly paid, fully fed, kindly treated job of the
    astronaut of the 21st century: the programmer.</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/26ff2e1b2d0ffaee13dc48f64beb4aeb"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>The very same problem still exists: beginners are stuck
    at the choice, there isn’t a straight path to become a good programmer and the
    community isn’t so warm in welcoming the newbie questions like “iz pythn a gut
    lang???”. The path to a successful programming career is even vaguer than before.
    You (supposing you are a beginner) should choose between <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Expert-proficient-programmer-learning-practices/dp/1838552650/">C++/C++11/C++14/C++17/C++20</a>,
    Java, C#, Kotlin, PHP (what?), Python, Node.js, JavaScript, (wait, with Angular,
    React or Vue?) and so on.</p><h2>The language, the technology, or the skills?</h2><p>To
    answer your main question, I have to ask you one first. <strong>What do you want?</strong>
    Are you excited to build mobile apps, a website, a website like Facebook or a
    website like Medium, or do you want to build a desktop application like Photoshop?
    Maybe you are fully into the game development? Mobile? Desktop?</p><p>The most
    intelligent way to answer “<strong>what should I know to get hired at a tech company
    as a software engineer</strong>?” is to find out the main skills you should master
    to successfully pass the technical interview. But first, we should put things
    in order, let’s dive into the programming world, its countries and cities, its
    cultures and wars, its wins and losses. For those who aren’t patient enough, scroll
    down to the “Preparing for Coding Interviews” section.</p><p>Exploring the world
    of programming brings us to 3 main platforms:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Web</strong>
    (Google Search, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and others)</p></li><li><p><strong>Desktop</strong>
    (Dropbox, Photoshop, Visual Studio, Skype and others)</p></li><li><p><strong>Mobile</strong>
    (<a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">SoloLearn</a>, Instagram, Uber and others)</p></li></ol><p><em>Most
    of the services above exist in almost all of the platforms, for instance, Skype
    is a desktop, mobile and (although poorly done) web application, Twitter is a
    web and mobile application and so on.</em></p><h3>Web</h3><p>Web itself is a huge
    concept in this context, to shed light on it, we should separate it into so-called
    front-end and back-end, the latter being my personal favorite. Front-end is what
    you see, back-end is what you need in order to see what you see. Again, front-end
    is the look and feel, back-end is the servers running the application which processes
    user requests, handles database queries and so forth.</p><p><strong>Front-end.</strong>
    If you want to master the look and feel, i.e. build websites that are so beautiful
    that users fall in love, you should know HTML (the look), CSS (the look and feel),
    JavaScript (the feel). This isn’t just enough, using pure JavaScript is not enough
    nowadays, so you have to choose the right framework, currently popular Angular,
    React or Vue. Which one to choose is mostly based on the company you like the
    most, Google or Facebook? Go with Angular if you like Google, and with React if
    you like Facebook. If you don’t like any of them (weird), go with Vue. Simple!
    Besides these, you should master some fundamental concepts, like the inner workings
    of the HTTP Protocol, be familiar with web servers (at least you should not be
    scared of names like Apache or Nginx). Being a front-end developer means you get
    the data to render (beautify for users) from the back-end, so some minimum understanding
    of what an API is, what is JSON (and why it’s better than XML) is a must. (If
    anything sounds way too unfamiliar, check the References section at the end of
    this post).</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*mJ_4xsEgEizLg9xenU1yUw.jpeg"
    alt="One of many memes on the web describing the difference between front-end
    and back-end"><em>One of many memes on the web describing the difference between
    front-end and back-end</em></p><p>*<em>Back-end. *</em>The unseen truth, the untold
    story. In the old days, knowing PHP was enough to call yourself a back-end developer,
    then Microsoft introduced ASP.NET. They were fighting each other until Node.js
    came and put things in their best order. Some concepts of event-driven development
    are best applied at Node.js, so if you choose it, you are doing a good favor to
    your project.</p><p>The confusing part of the back-end is its language diversity,
    well, you can use any language you want at the back-end, the point is, “back-end”
    is a short name for “query database, process data, respond to client and do it
    as efficient as you can” and choosing the “right” language/technology/database
    is not an option. While some developers go with Relational Databases like MySQL
    or PostgreSQL, newcomers choose the dark side, NoSQL (like Cassandra or MongoDB).
    The choice is really yours, but I’ve got a simple formula. Do you have a strict
    schema for your data and it won’t change much in the near future? Choose Relational
    Database. Do you have more than million visits per minute? Change to NoSQL (painfully).
    Does your product change rapidly? Choose NoSQL. Let’s say you chose the side,
    now, what concrete technology should you choose? Do you like Microsoft and you
    have Windows Servers? Choose MsSQL. Do you like Oracle? Choose Oracle. Are you
    ok with Oracle, but you hate Microsoft at the same time? Choose MySQL. You just
    really don’t want to hurt anyone? Choose PostgreSQL.</p><p>NoSQL comes in tricky.
    It really depends on your service and data architecture. You’ve got just documents
    and some weak connections among them? Choose MongoDB. You need to store a huge
    bunch of key-value pairs? Choose Redis. You are working with a graph-like structure
    (Facebook friends graph, Google knowledge graph, etc.)? Choose Neo4j. Aren’t really
    sure what exactly you need, but you feel that you need all of them? Choose ArangoDB.</p><p>While
    database holds all the necessary data, you should define an API through which
    your clients can request and read/write to the database. The most useful option
    here is Node.js, though you can go with PHP or ASP.NET or Ruby or Python, my personal
    recommendation would be Node.js. Well, Facebook uses PHP at its backend, kind
    of. They rewrote a huge part of PHP in C++. Some use Python while others prefer
    Ruby. It’s true that you can use almost any language at the back-end, for instance,
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Expert-proficient-programmer-learning-practices/dp/1838552650/">Google
    uses C++</a>, Java and Python (along with Go). For low-level data processing,
    C++ fits the best, for background jobs like updating user’s friend recommendations,
    Java is a good option. For data analysis or natural language processing or for
    nowadays highly popular AI-related tasks you most probably will use Python.</p><p>Again,
    besides various languages, frameworks, databases at back-end, there are some core
    concepts that you have to master.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Caching</strong>. Starting
    from the CPU cache (with different levels) and ending with browser cache. Caching
    used everywhere, for high load services like Google Search or Facebook, caching
    is extremely necessary.</p></li><li><p><strong>Servers</strong>. While you might
    think this is related to the hardware (which will be great if you know how to
    setup several computers to work as one piece in storing and processing data),
    for the back-end developer server means the web server. Popular web server nowadays
    is Nginx and knowing how to setup and configure it will pay highly in your future
    endeavors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sockets</strong>. Cornerstone of the network
    programming. Everything you send/receive via network is done by sockets. Knowing
    low-level details of socket programming is a good bonus in your skills inventory
    (knowing difference between TCP sockets, UDP sockets and what are WebSockets is
    a huge plus).</p></li><li><p><strong>Database Design</strong>. No matter what
    DBMS you choose or have to work with, operating with data will be one of your
    main tasks. Ability to see the complete picture, visualize data and connections
    between data units is a skill you will master during your whole programming career.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security</strong>.
    As other concepts mentioned above, this one is very broad, too. You can’t master
    any of them completely, so you should at least be familiar with some best practices
    such as storing password hashes rather than as plain texts. Checking requests
    via API token, verifying user permissions for each request and so on.</p></li></ul><h3>Desktop</h3><p>We
    will talk about the part of the desktop application that actually makes it a desktop
    application. There are tons of applications on Desktop platforms that need specific
    skill set, for instance, Photoshop is working with images, and knowing image processing
    algorithms and techniques is a must if you want to write something like Photoshop.
    Knowing socket programming is a must if you want to write something like Dropbox.
    Knowing how to engineer a compiler is a must of you want to build a compiler or
    IDE like Visual Studio. We won’t touch upon specifics, let’s just explore the
    languages you most probably will use if you want to work on desktop platform.</p><p>When
    it comes to languages for desktop applications programmers are having a hard time
    choosing among <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Programming-programmer-learning-practices/dp/1838552650/">C++</a>,
    Java or C#. There is a simple formula to make the right choice: if you like Microsoft,
    use C#. If you like Oracle, use Java. If you think that a programming language
    should not be owned by a particular company, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Expert-proficient-programmer-learning-practices/dp/1838552650/">use
    C++</a>. If this isn’t helping much, let’s discuss the actual sub-platforms. If
    you write software only for Windows users, C# is the best choice. It’s kind of
    obvious as both are products of Microsoft and they fit together the best. Though
    C# developers insist that after the release of .Net Core, C# can be used in Linux
    environment, too, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Expert-proficient-programmer-learning-practices/dp/1838552650/">I
    personally suggest to go with C++</a> if you want to cover Linux. The point is,
    C++ was been created as a cross-platform programming language, which works great
    in all operating systems out there (yes, even MacOS). Well, cross-platform in
    this context supposes that you have to compile your C++ project in all operating
    systems separately to ship “different” executables of your application for each
    concrete OS. And, honestly, C++ lacks any GUI. The greatest excuse for that is
    the fact that “C++ is for hardcore developers, and hardcore developers use nothing
    but Terminal (command line interface)”. However, kind developers gathered together
    and created Qt, the very best cross-platform GUI library that fits perfectly with
    C++.</p><p>Finally, if you get angry with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Expert-proficient-programmer-learning-practices/dp/1838552650/">complexity
    of C++</a> and the fact that you should connect a separate library like Qt to
    have complete GUI experience for your users and you hate to compile and ship different
    executables of your product for different OS, go with Java. Java has its virtual
    machine which makes it easy to ship the executable. Your application works equally
    fine on any OS where JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is installed.</p><h3>Mobile</h3><p>When
    speaking of Java, first thing that comes to mind is Android. Long before Kotlin
    has been introduced to the world, Java was the de facto language in order to implement
    Android apps. Nowadays, Kotlin takes hearts of developers and allows even better
    experience of developing apps for Android platform. So, if you want to make Android
    apps, you should choose between Java and Kotlin. To make the correct choice, we
    should look behind the scenes. The point is, Google is not so cool with Oracle.
    Oracle owns Java and Java dominates in Google’s Android, so to have some flexibility
    here, Google had to introduce an option for the light side (or the dark side,
    up to you) and introduced <strong>Kotlin</strong> as “<em>wow, why use Java if
    there is such a great language we support</em>”. I personally suggest you start
    with Kotlin if you are just starting your Android developer career, though to
    be a competent developer in the market, you have to support previously implemented
    apps in Java, so, knowing Java will be a good bonus in your CV.</p><p>And finally,
    iOS. The iLand. An entirely different story. For a long time Objective-C was the
    dominant language for iOS and to be completely honest, mastering Objective-C required
    a serious approach, tough look and some good perseverance. That was the main issue
    of relatively small number of Objective-C developers out there and Apple finally
    made the right move by introducing <strong>Swift</strong>. Swift is much easier
    to master than Objective-C, which lead to increase in the number of iOS developers.
    So, to be an iOS developer, you need to go with Swift, but to be a really confident
    developer, it is suggested to master Objective-C to support apps (tons of apps)
    already written in Objective-C.</p><p>I should mention React Native here, as it
    allows to write apps for both Android and iOS platforms using just JavaScript,
    however, as a new and rapidly changing player in the market, let’s just consider
    that it exists and you already can write simple apps if you know only JavaScript.</p><h2><strong>Preparing
    for Coding Interviews</strong></h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*-m_hxcxFCO0_-ND-FBFz6g.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>There are concepts that are fundamental in programming world. Most
    of the technical interviews are meant to discover your problem solving skills
    and knowing those concepts, so besides mastering a programming language, you should
    be familiar with the concepts that are somewhat required in programmer’s arsenal.
    Here’s an excerpt from my recent lesson post in <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">SoloLearn</a>
    (below are the links to Android and iOS apps).<a href="http://bit.ly/sololearn-android"><strong>SoloLearn:

    successfully prepare for coding interviews you should be confident in the following
    areas:1. Algorithms &amp; Data Structures2. Computer Organization &amp; Operating
    Systems3. Coding4. System Design</p><p><strong>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</strong>
    This is the most wanted skill set for programmers. Here are the subjects every
    programmer must be familiar with:</p><p><strong>Algorithm Complexity:</strong>
    Big-O notation and how to calculate algorithms complexity; knowing which algorithm
    is better based on their complexity, e.g. O(N) vs O(logN).</p><p><strong>Basic
    Data Structures &amp; adapters:</strong> Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue.</p><p><strong>Sorting
    &amp; Searching:</strong> Knowing various sorting algorithms helps you to identify
    the best possible implementation for your projects. For practice, try to implement
    insertion sort, selection sort or merge sort and spot the difference between linear
    search and binary search.</p><p><strong>Trees &amp; Graphs:</strong> Trees and
    Graphs are everywhere, starting from “friends graph” in Facebook to “knowledge
    graph” in Google Search.</p><p><strong>Hashtables:</strong> Being one of the most
    efficient data structures in the world, hashtables are always a good choice. You
    should be able to implement a Hashtable and be familiar with techniques to solve
    collisions.</p><p><strong>Computer Organization &amp; Operating Systems</strong>
    It is strongly advised to be familiar with topics like:</p><ul><li><p>Bitwise
    operations</p></li><li><p>How does the CPU execute machine code</p></li><li><p>What’s
    the difference between static RAM and dynamic RAM</p></li><li><p>What kind of
    OS kernel types exist</p></li><li><p>What’s the difference between “mutex” and
    “semaphore”</p></li><li><p>What is a deadlock and what is a livelock</p></li></ul><p><strong>Coding</strong>
    You should have really good knowledge of at least one programming language. Knowing
    all the pros and cons, best practices of your favorite language will always help
    you write efficient, elegant and readable code.It is highly recommended to practice
    by solving challenging problems, such as (all the problems below could be found
    on <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">SoloLearn</a>):</p><ul><li><p>The Josephus
    Problem</p></li><li><p>Tower of Hanoi</p></li><li><p>String Compression</p></li><li><p>Balanced
    Parenthesis</p></li><li><p>Twin Prime Numbers</p></li></ul><p><strong>System Design</strong>
    Knowing Object-Oriented Programming is a must for a modern programmer. System
    Design means thinking about the whole system, being able to design its architecture,
    dissect it into classes, define object interactions. To be prepared try to answer
    the questions below:- How would you design Google Search? What if there are millions
    of simultaneous requests per second?- How would you implement Facebook’s friend
    search?- Why would you use a Relational Database Management System?- Why would
    you use a NoSQL DB?</p><p>It is highly recommended to know and use the correct
    design patterns. For example, you should know the difference between a Composite
    and a Decorator.</p><p>While junior developers are mostly required to have good
    problem solving skills and your first job won’t require knowing all the points
    listed above, this list will be a good help to plan your career.</p><p>For a good

  :title: How to develop an eye for Design
  :content: <p>When I started off in design, I sucked.</p><p>I was obsessed with copying
    pieces of the trending Dribbble shots, but oblivious to how all the pieces worked
    together. If you could see the harsh drop shadows and unnecessary flourish I added
    to things, you would gasp in horror.</p><p>Though I was no product design prodigy,
    I figured out how to quickly hack together the skills I needed. And now I want
    to share one of those lessons with you. Whether or not you’re a designer, this
    exercise will help sharpen your product sense and improve your eye for design.</p><h2><strong>Don’t
    just use apps, study them</strong></h2><p>You develop your design eye by thinking
    as if you were the designer of a product. Open an app you use often and resist
    the urge to start scrolling through content. Instead, I want you to actively focus
    on the screen in front of you. Here are some things to keep in mind:</p><p>*<em>Hierarchy*</em>How
    does the design guide your focus? What information is highlighted? How does color
    and text treatment signal the importance of certain elements?</p><p><strong>Content</strong>What
    specific wording was chosen for this experience? What content is visible and more
    interestingly, what content isn’t? How is spacing used to frame the content?</p><p><strong>Intent</strong>Why
    would someone open this app? What problem does it solve? How could the design
    help to solve that problem even better?</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>Who are
    the people using this product? How might their use cases be different from yours?
    How does the design serve these use cases?</p><h2>Breaking down the app</h2><p>In
    the GIFs below, I’ve deconstructed apps to make it easier to focus on each component.
    You may observe details you didn’t recognize before, as you try to anticipate
    what component will be next within the animation. As you watch each component
    build upon the next, be curious about everything you see and think through the
    choices that had to be made for this product.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*jvooXcxt821Gkk47mAThWQ.gif"
    alt="Airbnb deconstructed"><em>Airbnb deconstructed</em></p><p>Some observations
    to get you started:</p><ul><li><p>The placeholder text in the search bar could
    have just said “Search here” but instead they mention a specific city. Though
    I have no intention of going to London, seeing the possibility of it is exciting.</p></li><li><p>I
    wonder how many iterations they tried with Dates and Guests only being visible
    at a later point in the flow. I’m sure many designs have gone through explorations
    where the Dates aren’t presented until you select a location. This makes me curious
    about how people search and when they introduce filters to their searches.</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vxPld46faXCHFzWXE9CX7Q.gif" alt="Twitter
    deconstructed"><em>Twitter deconstructed</em></p><p>Observations:</p><ul><li><p>Notice
    how the number of Retweets and Likes is bold</p></li><li><p>The time stamp includes
    not just the date, but also the specific time. Why might that be the case? Also,
    notice where the timestamp is shortened elsewhere in the app (e.g. “5h” on Feed
    view or “4/14/18” on Profile view). Think through the different intentions of
    those views.</p></li><li><p>There’s a composer in view to add another tweet and
    the language is specific. It’s not just “Add a Tweet”, it’s “Add another Tweet”.</p></li></ul><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*SuXjx5bGeJxNBO4S3rB8oA.gif" alt="Spotify
    deconstructed"><em>Spotify deconstructed</em></p><p>Observations:</p><ul><li><p>Notice
    how Spotify keeps the playing song in view</p></li><li><p>The content they’ve
    chosen to display for this New Releases view includes new playlists and new albums/singles.</p></li><li><p>The
    playlist New Music Friday has a follower count, while the playlist Release Radar
    does not. Let’s dig into this constraint — because release radar is specific to
    the user, this would not have followers. Someone had to map out all of the content
    use cases and decide on the appropriate subheaders to pair with them.</p></li></ul><h2>Know
    the rules, so you can break em</h2><p>Next time you’re sitting in a Lyft or waiting
    on a friend, open up an app and think through the reasons why the designers chose
    to design it that way. By routinely analyzing other apps, you’ll develop your
    product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself.</p><p>I want to hear
    from you! Feel free to reach out and let me know your thoughts. I’m here to help

  :title: Office Politic 101 — Kumpulan Kisah
  :content: '<p>Photo by Austin Distel on Unsplash</p><p>Karena gue orangnya malas
    pakai intro panjang-panjang dan sebetulnya malas nulis, jadi mari kita langsung
    to the point aja. Btw, tulisan ini adalah opini pribadi selama jadi pegawai di
    berbagai industri selama 12 tahun terakhir juga cerita dari beberapa rekan yang
    suka curhat ke gue, intinya ini tidak menyasar pada satu perusahaan tertentu.
    Well, kalau terbaca demikian, udah sih ah jangan baper, justru saatnya berbenah
    diri bukan?</p><p>So, pernah dengar nggak sih kalo dunia perkantoran itu 1% kerja
    dan 99% drama? Bisa dibilang ada benarnya. Kerjaan kita kan bisa dibilang benda
    mati, nggak bernafas. Nggak kaya merawat tanaman atau merawat hewan yang masih
    bisa berinteraksi. Tantangannya adalah kerjaan kita yang benda mati itu kan harus
    dikerjakan oleh manusia, yang mana manusia itu lo tahu sendiri kan kompleksnya
    kaya apa. Satu perusahaan anggap saja minimal pegawainya 20 orang aja, nah 20
    masalah tuh. 20 kepala yang berusaha untuk menjadi satu, bahu-membahu (eh, yakin?)
    untuk mencapai tujuan utama perusahaan, yaitu ya mendapatkan keuntungan (plis
    jangan ajak gue ngomong big message atau mengubah dunia dulu ya, gue orangnya
    practical banget, itu nanti aja belakangan).</p><p>Kita sebut saja manusia-manusia
    tersebut mulai mereka yang tukang jilat ke bos, mereka yang gila kredit, mereka
    yang adem-adem bae yang penting terima gaji bulanan, mereka yang orangnya <em>business
    as usual</em> banget pokoknya ya udahlah nggak perlu berkontribusi lebih sama
    perusahaan, ada juga yang berusaha keras tapi kelihatan lebay karena gak strategis,
    ada yang gede doang omongnya tapi pas suruh implementasi yawla nihil bos. Belum
    lagi dengan segala politik lobi melobi entah untuk tujuan-tujuan tertentu yang
    hanya mereka dan Gusti Allah yang tahu.</p><p>Dari keadaan tersebut, gue berpikir,
    nih kebanyakan soal office politic tuh nggak diketahui sama mereka yang mungkin
    fresh graduate atau tipe-tipe yang penting manut aja. Lebih parah lagi ada yang
    suka tidak sadar dia sedang terjebak dalam office politic dan ngikutin arus aja
    sampai akhirnya tenggelam dan end up jadi korban. Tanpa dia sadari, eh dia udah
    ga males aja gitu berkontribusi ke perusahaan tersebut. Jadi, gue mau share ini
    beberapa hal tentang office politic yang kira-kira bisa menjadi kitab pegangan
    kalian biar plis deh jangan clueless gitu loh jadi orang. Eh iya, ini bukan ngajarin
    orang jadi jahat ya, tapi justru bisa membuat kalian punya pandangan dan perspektif
    baru soal kerja di kantor yang nggak selalu soal berkarya dan dapat gaji aja.
    Kalo di kantor gada office politic (dan drama), wah anak HR seneng banget pasti
    karena turnovernya pasti bakal rendah.</p><h2>“Lo anak kesayangan C-Level yang
    mana?”</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/11520/0*278NTp-f5hZupqIe"

    Lark</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>Eh,
    ini bukan kisah pribadi ya, tapi dari teman. Jadi dia cerita di startup tempat
    dia bekerja, bahkan C-level-nya tuh nge-gank gitu loh. Contoh ada aja nih anak
    kesayangan CEO atau kesayangannya CMO, tapi gank CEO ini sama COO dan Head apa
    gitu vs kaum minoritynya C-level yang lain. Entah ya gue bingung sih pas diceritain,
    ini sekolahan TK apa perusahaan kok main gank begitu. Ya intinya hal yang kelihatan
    kecil begini bisa ngaruh sampai misalnya approval budget lalu approval ide-ide
    yang mau diluncurkan ke market. Lantas kita nih sebagai cucunguk yang di tengah
    bagaimana dong bersikap? Pilihan selalu kembali ke diri lo, mau jadi ignorant
    dengan tetap kerja tapi tidak menjilat dan biasa aja atau malah memanfaatkan kesempatan
    ini untuk mendapatkan nama atau posisi serta apresiasi yang lebih besar. Trust
    me, hal seperti ini ada dan ini termasuk dalam office politic.</p><h2>“Wah, lu
    masih bergaul sama yang udah resign? Promosi lo terancam sih nih…”</h2><p><img

    saja P, bekerja di sebuah perusahaan yang kerjanya kurang lebih seperti customer
    service. Si P ditawarkan promosi menjadi seorang Supervisor karena kerjanya selalu
    baik, attitude bagus pokoknya jarang cari masalah. Dia juga bergaul dengan banyak
    orang mulai dari level manajer hingga staff, anaknya supel dan semua orang senang
    sama dia. Tapi ada nih salah seorang leader yang melihat bahwa P ini main sama
    3 orang yang resign yang ternyata punya masalah sama leader ini. Padahal P ini
    kan yang tadi gw bilang, main sama semua orang. Akhirnya sejak pertama kali ditanyakan
    soal promosi, P tidak pernah dapat update apapun. Usut punya usut sang leader
    agak malas mengetahui P ini masih main sama 3 orang yang punya masalah dan resign
    ini. P pun bingung, dia maunya profesional aja, teman di luar kantor ya sudah
    teman aja, kenapa harus disangkutpautkan dengan karirnya di dalam kantor tersebut.
    P pun hanya bisa bersabar menunggu, padahal excitementnya sudah begitu tinggi
    waktu dia mendengar bahwa akan dipromosikan. Kebingungannya sekarang juga belum
    terjawab, menurutnya jadi serba salah keadaan yang ada saat ini.</p><h2>“Si skill
    B aja lalu minta backupan ‘Bapak’ supaya dapat project gede”</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9640/0*jAKk6RFDRtfsAOyt"

    Flour</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>Alkisah
    C hidup di sebuah startup antah berantah nun jauh di negeri khayalan. Intinya
    si C ini prinsipnya “Bring It On deh…” dia seorang problem solver yang melihat
    bahwa segala sesuatu pasti ada solusinya walaupun prosesnya panjang. Semua itu
    sebetulnya ada modal skill dan pengalaman juga. Tapi sayangnya di setiap makhluk-makhluk
    seperti C, selalu ada cucunguk macam J yang merasa dia ingin mendapatkan hal yang
    sama tapi gada projectnya gitu loh. Si C yang orangnya practical, realistis, anti
    basa-basi ini ujung-ujungnya jadi korban dan ga punya backingan apapun. C bekerja
    sebagaimana dia harus bekerja yaitu memberikan kontribusi bagi perusahaan. Tapi
    pasti lah ada orang-orang yang entah kurang piknik hidupnya di situ-situ aja yang
    envy sama dia akhirnya mencari jalan ninja untuk semacam menendang orang ini keluar
    dengan kekuatan bekingan dari ‘Bapak’ yang paling kuat. Untungnya C ya pintar
    dan anti drama, dia memilih mundur terhormat dan membiarkan perusahaan ini ya
    beberapa waktu kemudian keadaannya ya begitu deh progress enggak, mundur juga
    enggak.</p><p>Nah, dari 3 cerita di atas, gue rasa masih banyak cerita-cerita
    office politic lain yang beredar, yang selalu mengisi ruang-ruang di kantin makan
    siang (sewaktu belum ada Corona). Bumbu-bumbu pedas yang tersebar lewat obrolan
    grup WA tanpa Bos serta medium lainnya.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6528/0*zLJc5VDXF5oV_kEX"

    Politic sudah ada sejak lama dan akan terus ada. Lantas lo ada tips ga sih, Ke
    untuk menghadapi office politic? Oh, tentu saja ada. Tapi pastinya ini ga akan
    semudah itu diimplementasikan di semua orang, di semua perusahaan karena memang
    treatmentnya harus case by case banget. So, ini beberapa saran gue.</p><ol><li><p>Ketika
    menjadi anak baru pahamilah dan carilah siapa key person yang disegani semua orang,
    biasanya yang paling galak nih. Kalau gue cari tahu lah zodiaknya apa sampai cari
    tahu Natal Chartnya. Ini ga buat semua orang ya, tapi mengetahui kepribadian seseorang
    via zodiak sangatlah membantu. Intinya sih cari info yang banyak tentang key person
    yang banyak hubungan kerja sama lo. Tujuannya bukan buat menjilat, tapi biar lo
    kalo bisa nggak bikin banyak masalah sama ni orang.</p></li><li><p>Berpikir strategis
    bagaimana caranya supaya lo tetap bisa berkarya tapi still under the radar. Entah
    sih, gue pribadi orangnya kurang gila credit dan sukanya memang lempar apreasiasi
    sama tim ketimbang sama gw. Gw agak anti sorotan tapi karena ngomong gue menclak
    menclok makanya ada aja urusan. Ini tricky sih kalo buat anak baru ya gimana coba
    under the radar orang gue mau kelihatan kerja ama bos gw. Ya makanya gue bilang
    tips gue ga applied buat semua orang</p></li><li><p>Hindari orang-orang yang toxic
    dengan cara lebih sensitif dan selektif memilih pertemanan di kantor. Ingat ya
    orang toxic itu gampang kok ke-detect yang kaya apa kalau kalian mungkin sudah
    lama kerja sebagai pegawai. Gue bukan bilang jangan bergaul dengan mereka, tapi
    batasi pergaulan dan nggak perlu banyak ngomong soal orang lain ama mereka, baik-baik
    malah diputarbalikan</p></li><li><p>Ga usah terlalu riya apa-apa soal kantor lo
    pampang di segala apalah sosmed. Lagi-lagi plis ya, ini pendapat gw. Karena nih,
    ada aja orang-orang yang mungkin udah negatif duluan ama lo nih. Kalo gw mungkin
    misalnya gw kenal orangnya dan dia menceritakan prestasinya, gw akan hargai, ya
    karena gw kenal, tapi ya jaga-jaga aja sih apa pendapat orang lain. Apalagi kalian
    tahu sendiri, socmed itu kan menutupi derita dan menebarkan bahagia, salah-salah
    orang kira kita hidup bahagia terus eh lalu ngiri deh dibawa ampe ke kantor.</p></li><li><p>Ini
    yang paling da best: UDAH FOKUS KERJA AJA! Hidup sudah syulit, Bruh! Apalagi era
    COVID-19 begini. Fokus lah sama pengembangan skill kita dalam pekerjaan, fokus
    ke pengembangan diri di luar dunia kerja jadi hidup lu ga melulu soal kantor (ya
    biar yang lo banggain ga cuma achievement lo di kantor doang gitu).</p></li></ol><p>Dah
    ah, nulis kepanjangan malah nanti kebanyakan di kepala kalian dan nggak bisa memproses.
    Walau office politic menyebalkan, tapi percayalah, karena itu kita bisa tumbuh
    dan menjadi dewasa dalam dunia kerja, ya itu juga kalo lo ambil sisi positifnya
    ya. Good luck!</p>'

  :title: Donald Trump and His Supporters Are a Cancer on the Body Politic
  :content: '<p>Since Donald Trump persists in his effort to bring down the Republican
    party–and the republic itself–through his reprehensible antics and despicable
    demagoguery, it is necessary to make abundantly clear to all and sundry just how
    vile Trump is. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-havoc-that-donald-trump-wreaks--on-his-own-party/2015/08/26/7418c2c8-4b4c-11e5-84df-923b3ef1a64b_story.html">George
    Will</a> is up for the job:</p><blockquote><p><em>Every sulfurous belch from the
    molten interior of the volcanic Trump phenomenon injures the chances of a Republican
    presidency. After Donald Trump finishes plastering a snarling face on conservatism,
    any Republican nominee will face a dauntingly steep climb to reach even the paltry
    numbers that doomed Mitt Romney.</em><em>It is perhaps quixotic to try to distract
    Trump’s supporters with facts, which their leader, who is no stickler for dignity,
    considers beneath him. Still, consider these:</em><em>The white percentage of
    the electorate has been shrinking for decades and will be about <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/report/2015/01/06/101605/the-changing-face-of-americas-electorate/">2
    points smaller in 2016</a> than in 2012. In 2008, Barack Obama became the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/25/politics/obama-40-percent/">first
    president elected while losing the white vote by double digits</a>. In 2012, Hispanics,
    the nation’s largest minority, were for the first time a double-digit (<a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/11/07/latino-voters-in-the-2012-election/">10
    percent</a>) portion of the electorate. White voters were <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/scocca/2012/11/mitt_romney_white_voters_the_gop_candidate_s_race_based_monochromatic_campaign.html">nearly
    90 percent of Romney’s vote</a>. In 1988, George H.W. Bush won 59 percent of the
    white vote, which translated into 426 electoral votes. Twenty-four years later,
    Romney won 59 percent of the white vote and just 206 electoral votes. He lost
    the nonwhite vote by 63 points, receiving just 17 percent of it. If the Republicans’
    2016 nominee does not do better than Romney did among nonwhite voters, he will
    need 65 percent of the white vote, which was last achieved by Ronald Reagan when
    carrying 49 states in 1984. Romney did even slightly worse among Asian Americans
    — the fastest-growing minority — than among Hispanics. Evidently, minorities generally
    detected Republican ambivalence, even animus, about them. This was before Trump
    began receiving rapturous receptions *because</em> he obliterates inhibitions
    about venting hostility.*<em>Trump is indifferent to those conservative tenets
    (e.g., frugality: He welcomed Obama’s stimulus) to which he is not hostile (e.g.,
    property rights: He adored the Supreme Court’s *Kelo</em> decision vastly expanding
    government’s power of eminent domain). So, Trump’s appeal must derive primarily
    from his views about immigration. Including legal immigration, concerning which
    he favors a “pause” of unspecified duration.*<em>Some supporters simply find Trump
    entertainingly naughty. Others, however, have remarkable cognitive dissonance.
    They properly execrate Obama’s executive high-handedness that expresses progressivism’s
    traditional disdain for the separation of powers that often makes government action
    difficult. But these same Trumpkins simultaneously despise GOP congressional leaders
    because they do not somehow jettison the separation of powers and work conservatism’s
    unimpeded will from Capitol Hill.</em><em>[. . .]</em><em>Republicans are the
    party of growth, or they are superfluous. The other party relishes allocating
    scarcities — full employment for the administrative state.</em><em>Trump assumes
    a zero-sum society, where one person’s job is another’s loss. Hence his rage against
    other nations’ “stealing” jobs — “our” jobs.</em></p></blockquote><p>To be sure,
    it is not enough to point out just how revolting Trump is. It is necessary as
    well to point out that <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2015/08/27/donald-trump-nativist-campaign-racists">his
    supporters are no collective prize either</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>To the extent
    that Donald Trump’s presidential campaign is about any actual issue, it is about
    opposition to immigration. Trump has, among other things, proposed deporting 11
    million unauthorized immigrants currently in the United States, expressed support
    for reducing legal immigration levels, jeered at immigrant “anchor babies,” and
    called for an end to birthright citizenship, even though it is constitutionally
    <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2010/08/11/born-in-the-usa">required</a>.</em><em>Trump’s
    slogan, the catchall phrase that binds his scattershot campaign together, is “Make
    This Country Great Again.” In combination with his immigration platform, the clear
    implication of the slogan is that America has, over the years, become a not great
    place, and immigrants are at least one reason — perhaps the primary reason — why.</em><em>Nativism
    is at the core of Donald Trump’s campaign; it is one of the keys to his appeal.
    And amongst his supporters and admirers, that aggressive nativism often shades
    into outright racism.</em></p></blockquote><p>Read the whole thing. Lie down with
    dogs, and . . . well, you know the rest. Some might be unwilling to blame Trump
    for the racism of his supporters. I am not unwilling; it should surprise precisely
    no one that Trump’s nativist, hate-filled campaign would attract racists to it.
    After all, we <em>are</em> talking about a candidate <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/21/the-new-political-code-word-for-the-2016-elections/">whose
    first response</a> to the beating of a homeless Hispanic man by two thugs–one
    of whom “was inspired” by Trump’s anti-immigration language–was to say that “.
    . . I will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love
    this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate.”</p><p>And
    of course, such a response is <em>not</em> presidential. In fact, it’s not even
    <em>human</em>.</p><p>Donald Trump and his supporters don’t belong in the Republican
    party. They belong more properly in the ranks of organizations like ISIL. They
    are both buffoonish and barbaric, and should be laughed out of any civilized political
    gathering–<em>especially</em> political gatherings that seek to choose the next
    president of the United States.</p><h2>Like this:</h2><p>Like Loading…</p><h2>Related</h2><p><em>Originally

    Feldman</a> begins to tell her story in The New Yorker by first stating a very
    important fact; something she noticed when her job became to design the personality
    of a chatbot called Kai: <strong>most bots out there don’t really have a personality</strong>.</p><p>And
    the longer she worked on making the Kai bot “<em>friendly but authoritative, engaging
    but not creepy</em>”, the more she realized certain truths about creating a character
    for a bot. For starters, she noted that:</p><blockquote><h1>Chatbots must be agreeable
    to the point of obsequiousness.</h1></blockquote><p>But what really struck her
    was the conclusion she reached: all assistants (like Cortana and Siri and Alexa)
    have female names and female voices. The bottom line here being that they all
    exude femininity in different aspects.</p><blockquote><h1>…in the United States,
    the method for insuring that a technology speaks without giving offense has been
    to make it a woman</h1></blockquote><p>This is problematic because:</p><blockquote><h1>By
    creating interactions that encourage consumers to understand the objects that
    serve them as women, technologists abet the prejudice by which women are considered
    objects.</h1></blockquote><p>It turns out that A.I. systems pretending to be female
    are often subjected to <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/ive-seen-the-greatest-a-i-minds-of-my-generation-destroyed-by-twitter\">the
    same sorts of online harassment</a> as women. In her opinion, the solution to
    this problem is to realize that** bots don’t need to be human**. According to
    Jacqueline “We don’t need to make our technologies conform to the gender binary
    of human societies in order to like them.”</p><p>Even though this piece was published
    about a year ago, this topic is extremely relevant nowadays given how our society
    is becoming more and more aware about harassment and gender dynamics.<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-bot-politic\"><strong>The

  :title: Fear and Loathing in the Body Politic
  :content: '<p>Fear and Loathing in the Body Politic</p><p><strong>By Shanto Iyengar

    alt="Illustration: WildLivingArts/iStock"><em>Illustration: WildLivingArts/iStock</em></p><p><strong>American
    politics has become significantly more polarized</strong> and contentious over
    the past three decades. At the level of elected officials, the political parties
    are so far apart on most issues that gridlock and inaction have replaced bargaining
    and compromise as standard practice. The intransigence of elected officials is
    somewhat puzzling, since voters are by comparison moderate in their policy preferences.
    Most political scientists believe the ideological disconnect is attributable to
    several distorting influences, including candidates’ greater responsiveness to
    donors and activists, whose views are far from representative of ordinary citizens.</p><p>Ideological
    extremity is one standard for assessing polarization. Another metric is the level
    of hostility and ill will across the party divide. By this standard, it is clear
    that the electorate is indeed polarized; Democrats and Republicans view their
    opponents as hypocritical, selfish and closed-minded, and are unwilling to socialize
    with them, or even partner with them in different types of activities.</p><p>Interparty
    animus is clearly manifest in real-world behaviors — and the pervasiveness of
    these effects is astonishing. Data from online dating sites reveals that people
    are just as averse to initiating relationships with political opponents as they
    are with people of different social status and ethnicity. Marketing studies show
    that consumers respond negatively to products and companies associated with the
    opposing party. Overall, party preference has become a litmus test for values
    and character, eliciting behavioral responses that extend well beyond the political
    sphere. Political scientists refer to this phenomenon of generalized animosity
    and distrust toward political opponents as <em>affective polarization</em>.</p><blockquote><h1>Party
    preference has become a litmus test for values and character, eliciting behavioral
    responses that extend well beyond the political sphere.</h1></blockquote><p>Affective
    polarization is thought to be rooted in the psychology of group identity. We <em>Homo
    sapiens</em> are social animals; group affiliation is essential to our sense of
    self. When people think of themselves as either Democrats or Republicans, they
    develop both positive feelings for the in group and negative evaluations of the
    out group. As in the case of race, gender or religion, party preference is a form
    of group identity instilled at a very early age, and very resistant to modification.</p><p>A
    key difference, however, is that in the case of race, gender, nationality and
    other social categories, there are strong social norms that moderate the expression
    of hostility toward out groups. While racism and sexism are unacceptable, partyism
    is perfectly legitimate and is considered an appropriate form of cheerleading
    in the democratic process.</p><p>Partisan affect is largely distinct from questions
    of ideology. Scholars who focus solely on ideological polarization cannot fully
    explain the divergence of feelings toward co-partisans and opponents; for example,
    in some settings, affective polarization can increase while ideological divisions
    shrink. People can take centrist positions on policy issues yet still evince a
    deep dislike for opponents with similar preferences.</p><blockquote><h1>It is
    one thing to see your political opponents as shortsighted and dogmatic, but quite
    another when that sentiment intrudes into your market transactions.</h1></blockquote><p>Why
    does affective polarization matter if it is not closely tied to policy debates?
    One reason is that partisan animus spills over into nonpolitical arenas and affects
    both economic and social cooperation. It is one thing to see your political opponents
    as shortsighted and dogmatic, but quite another when that sentiment intrudes into
    your market transactions. For instance, one study found that people were willing
    to work for lower wages from employers who shared their party identification than
    from those who did not.</p><p>Increasing affective polarization portends serious
    repercussions, especially during times of political turmoil. There are multiple
    parallels between Watergate and the current era, and yet heightened affective
    polarization has fundamentally altered the political dynamics of scandal. The
    cover-up in the Nixon White House was brought to light by investigative news reports
    that, over time, became widely accepted as credible evidence of official wrongdoing.
    The media spotlight resulted in a significant erosion of President Nixon’s approval
    among both Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>In contrast, the multiple investigations
    swirling around the Trump administration have, to date, done little to undermine
    his standing among Republicans. Disdain for the opposition is so intense that
    partisans ignore the liabilities and misdeeds of their leaders. This feature of
    affective polarization — willingness to ignore reasonably objective information
    that challenges one’s sense of political identity — is disturbing. The real question
    at this point is whether enough has “gone wrong” that a reserve of shared democratic
    values will finally find expression to demand higher standards of behavior from
    public officials. The 2018 midterm elections should be revealing.•</p><p><strong>Shanto

  :title: Emetic For the Body Politic
  :content: "<p><strong>Emetic for the Body Politic</strong></p><p>In one important
    way, Donald Trump’s candidacy and his Presidency of the United States may be one
    of the better things that has happened in national politics in decades. Start
    out thinking of it as a political version of <em>The People v. Larry Flynt</em>,
    and it can be seen as an equally unpleasant and therefor textbook celebration
    of the First Amendment. In the one nation on earth where the freedom to say any
    thing we want is our primary right, there has not been a free market of ideas
    on the national political scene. Actual debate on many critical issues has been
    deadened by a stifling political orthodoxy. On those issues, it has been as if
    there is no difference between the two major parties. In terms of the American
    body politic, Trump is an emetic or a laxative or an enema. And, some cleaning
    out has been needed.</p><p>Some would say that the rise of Donald Trump and of
    Bernie Sanders was fueled by the loss of well paying industrial jobs, growing
    income inequality, and changing American demographics, but those things have not
    changed all that dramatically. The radical change this past election cycle is
    that each of those candidates had punctured the political orthodoxy that existed
    at the Presidential level. Voters had rushed to these candidates because they
    did not seem like they were cautiously reiterating what they have been told by
    their advisers and pollsters. To state it more bluntly, the people were and are
    tired of being lied to. The irony is that President Trump appears to be genuine
    because he clearly blurts out radical statements that are certainly not processed
    and canned, whether or not they are factual.</p><p>Until this past election, between
    the Presidential candidates of the major parties there has been no real debate
    or difference on issues such as the war on terror, on paying for being the world’s
    police, on the war on drugs, on a carbon tax to quickly reduce carbon emissions
    and take back the funds that go to the people who fund terrorism, on the high
    cost of health care for those in the last year of life, or on the religious nature
    of the terrorist threat facing our freedoms. Trump’s supporters relish that he
    is raising questions no President or candidate ever has. Why does the worker at
    the Ford plant in Louisville pay taxes that fund the military defense of the worker
    at the Volkswagen plant in Dresden? In the land of the free and the home of calling
    a spade a spade, why have our leaders bowed to prior restraint when it comes to
    even beginning a dialogue on a religion that is obsessed with exercising political
    control?</p><p>It is fashionable to excoriate Trump. The fault is not in our political
    stars, but in ourselves; we are underlings. Moving the paraphrase from Shakespeare
    to de Maistre, each nation gets the leadership it deserves. Some in the press
    will say that the media created Donald Trump, but they are too clever by half.
    It is not only that they covered Trump too much or not critically, but that they
    had helped create and maintain the cultural and political orthodoxy that he has
    profited from puncturing. This alone makes the Trump phenomenon a strong medicine
    for what has been blocking up the body politic.</p><p>Henry James once said that
    Americans are alone in acting on their first impressions, and though it is unlikely
    that many in the media have read our greatest novelist, they know how to profit
    from this observation. Three hundred and thirty million people live in the most
    peaceful and safe nation in the history of the planet, yet any incident that one
    hundred years ago would have filled two columns in a local newspaper now becomes
    a national media orgy that lasts for days. Two questions are always asked: Why
    was it allowed to happen? And what will be done about it? A local event becomes
    a national issue. No Presidential candidate will take a different stand on the
    war on terror, on the war on drugs, or on defense spending, because it only takes
    one incident for the media to turn that first question against him. No politician
    wants to let a Willie Horton out of jail. Hundreds of millions of travelers remove
    their shoes, because of one inept attempt at a shoe bomb.</p><p>A future Presidential
    candidate is out there. She is paying attention. She will say that we should have
    a carbon tax, that our taxpayers should not fund the defense of our wealthy competitors,
    that when a faith needs to use the worldly power to enforce its tenets it is expressing
    a lack of faith, that the war on drugs has created a massive federal police apparatus
    and is racist in its effect, that we need to rethink our approach to the military
    war on terror because it will never be won with guns and force, and that we should
    invest in educational infrastructure. Her attack on the old political orthodoxy
    will be seen as honest and she will be seen as being a leader. Ironically, Trump
    will have lit her path.</p><p>(Gerald Weaver is the author of the novel, <em>The
    First First Gentleman</em>, August 2016, London Wall Publishing. It is among other
    things a sly tribute to almost all the novels of Charles Dickens. His well-received
    first novel, <em>Gospel Prism</em>, was published in May 2015. Each of its twelve
    chapters paraphrases a great work, by Cervantes, Montaigne, Shakespeare, etc.
    Harold Bloom said it was “remarkable” and “charming but disturbing.”)</p>"

  :content: '<p>Solving a problem like obesity requires more than just policy measures;
    it takes true public engagement</p><p><strong>By Jerril Rechter</strong></p><p>Follow
    Jerril on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/JerrilRechter">@JerrilRechter</a></p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*JWbPbSIUCThaFolbQbLN7Q.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>Last
    year, the Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition made the
    case that unless policymakers apply the brakes on weight, obesity and diet-related
    disease and accelerate efforts to reduce undernutrition, everyone will pay a heavy
    price: death, disease, economic losses and degradation of the environment. Almost
    a fifth of the world’s obese adults live in six high-income countries, including
    Ireland, New Zealand and the UK.</p><p>This is the challenge we face also in Australia,
    where obesity is one of the most significant health challenges of our generation,
    accounting for about 7% of Australia’s burden of disease. Some 11.2 million Australian
    adults, or 63% of the adult population, are overweight or obese, according to
    a recent report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. More than a
    quarter of Australian children and adolescents aged between two and 17 years also
    fall into that category. Like in many other western nations, higher rates of obesity
    occur in areas of social disadvantage and outside our major cities.</p><p>Beside
    the human impact, the cost to the health system of obesity is unsustainable. In
    2008, the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates, the cost of obesity to the
    Australian economy was A$58bn, including health system, loss of productivity and
    carers’ costs.</p><p>So what can be done? Experience tells us that complex public
    health issues, such as obesity, can elicit polarised responses. On the one hand,
    the food systems that determine what we put in our mouths are massive social and
    economic networks. Proposing changes to food manufacturing or retailing can generate
    significant resistance from both large and small businesses. At an individual
    level, people’s daily food choices represent much more to them than simply fuel
    for their bodies. The foods we choose carry cultural, emotional and social meanings.
    Changing the availability of food and eating habits for the better is not easily
    done, especially among populations that suffer economic or social disadvantage.</p><p>In
    responding effectively to these challenges it will not be possible for one agency,
    or indeed government, to succeed alone; work must occur across public agencies,
    government, business and industry and with the community to build consensus and
    create solutions that benefit the whole population. And this work needs to draw
    on the growing body of evidence that suggests greater democratic participation
    is proving effective in finding long-term policy solutions to such issues.</p><h3>Changing
    behaviour</h3><p>That is the approach we have taken in Victoria, drawing on the
    expertise of the UK’s Behavioural Insights Team (BIT). In 2014, David Halpern,
    who has run BIT since its inception in 2010, started a two-year residency with
    us at health promotion agency VicHealth, with a focus on obesity. He challenged
    us to consider how we might apply behavioural insights to health promotion, and
    to imagine a policy development process that enabled citizens to engage directly
    with complex public health issues.</p><p>If citizens could understand the influences
    shaping their health decisions, he argued, and if we could build government, industry
    and community consensus on the required actions, we might ‘shift the dial’ on
    obesity by providing an enabling environment for government, industry and community
    action. And so, the Citizens’ Jury on Obesity was born.</p><p>The jury was asked
    to come up with solutions to the simple yet challenging question: how can we make
    it easier to eat better? VicHealth worked with the newDemocracy Foundation, a
    leading Australian research institute in democratic innovation, and a diverse
    range of other stakeholders and experts to develop the jury process. This independently
    designed and facilitated process took 100 everyday Victorians on a journey of
    discovery about the factors influencing the way they ate. It allowed them to make
    their own decisions on obesity, and to determine how they would like government,
    industry and the community to respond.</p><p>A total of 64 submissions from a
    wide range of stakeholders were presented via an online portal to the jurors.
    After six weeks of review and facilitated discussion online, the jurors met for
    two days at a face-to-face forum to deliberate, debate and create their ‘asks’.
    They read and watched a diverse range of material on food and obesity and considered
    evidence, opinions and policy and programme options. They also called for additional
    experts to present at the forum.</p><p>An essential aspect of the process design
    was to build broader awareness of this initiative in the wider Victorian population.
    VicHealth partnered with the Herald Sun — a major regional newspaper read by 1.3
    million Victorians every weekday — to promote the jury through a series of news
    articles, profiles of jurors, opinion editorials and a poll that elicited the
    views of its readership and which was shared with jurors.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*bhb4YWTH6zLcYN6t_hKHuw.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><h3><strong>Asks and impacts</strong></h3><p>The focus on food and
    the way we eat as factors in obesity resonated strongly with the jury. Of course,
    everyone has a relationship with food; it plays a central role in society and
    psychology, with influences such as social setting, colour and context affecting
    our food choices.</p><p>Twenty ‘asks’ emerged from the forum and formed a blueprint
    for coordinated action by government, industry and the community. These ‘asks’
    included support for a sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) tax, mandated healthy food
    labelling, multimedia education campaigns for healthy eating, subsidising those
    on low incomes to purchase healthy foods, and increasing the availability of drinking
    water at public events, parks and shopping centres. These were presented to a
    Citizens’ Jury Steering Committee that included representatives from the food
    and beverage industry, health sector, retail industry, government and policy experts,
    consumer advocates, academics and sporting organisations for consideration and
    public response.</p><blockquote><h1>“A trial at a hospital removed sugar-sweetened
    beverages from display in the café”</h1></blockquote><p>VicHealth’s evaluation
    of Victoria’s Citizens’ Jury on Obesity found that more than a third of jurors
    reported their understanding of obesity had changed a lot. Many were motivated
    to take personal action or to influence family behaviour. Some jurors wanted to
    become involved in advocacy activities. Of the stakeholders surveyed, 69% saw
    citizens’ juries as an effective way to involve everyday Victorians in public
    decision-making, and 50% of stakeholders said they would use the jury’s report
    in their work. Feedback from the jurors themselves also highlighted the power
    of this participatory approach to engage people in collaborative decision-making
    and to promote consensus building.</p><p>Media activities generated significant
    public debate on overweight and obesity issues. The VicHealth-Herald Sun Readers’
    Poll held in October 2015 yielded 2,580 responses, the highest response rate the
    newspaper has ever had to a survey.</p><h3>Where to from here?</h3><p>A number
    of initiatives across Australia — before and since the Citizens’ Jury — are leading
    to positive change, albeit with a long way to go. A recent trial at a major Victorian
    hospital removed SSBs from display in the main café. Sales of these drinks fell
    by 36,500 a year without affecting the retailer’s bottom line. Consumers simply
    substituted sugary drink purchases for healthier options, such as bottled water.</p><p>This
    year, 13 Victorian health services discontinued the sale of SSBs on their premises,
    while the New South Wales Government had phased them out of vending machines,
    cafés and catering services in hospitals and health facilities by December 2017.</p><p>The
    report Tipping the Scales: Australian Obesity Prevention Consensus was recently
    published with the endorsement of 34 medical and public health groups in Australia,
    calling for obesity prevention to be recognised as a national priority. The report
    includes a range of recommendations that would underpin a national obesity prevention
    plan. Among these are calls to restrict junk food advertising to children and
    to introduce a new tax on sugary drinks.</p><p>VicHealth also drove a highly successful
    public awareness campaign between 2015 and 2017 to make water the beverage of
    choice at major Melbourne sporting events, and to increase the availability of
    water where people exercise. In 2014, the Commonwealth Government introduced the
    Health Star Rating System for packaged foods in supermarkets. The system rates
    the overall nutritional profile of packaged food. The more stars, the healthier
    the choice. While Australians generally support the Health Star Rating System,
    public health experts agree that changes are needed; for example, making the system
    mandatory across all food categories, including fresh fruit and vegetables.</p><p>From
    May 2018, Victoria will join four other Australian state jurisdictions and introduce
    menu labelling for ready-to-eat food at food chain outlets and supermarkets. This
    will show consumers the energy content of food when eating out or at the supermarket,
    giving them more information with which to make healthier food choices.</p><p>When
    we are faced with complex challenges such as obesity, legislation can seem to
    offer the best hope for change, as it holds the power of compliance. Yet the power
    of true public engagement should not be downplayed. Victoria’s Citizens’ Jury
    on Obesity helped foster a broader discussion about obesity. Though the changes
    resulting directly from the process were limited, the experience does show the
    power of engagement when it is linked to the key stakeholders that can make change
    happen. There continues to be significant resistance from food manufacturers and
    large retailers to reforms that would decrease their sales of highly processed
    foods. It will take time, concerted advocacy and greater public accountability
    to drive multi-sector action to address obesity in Victoria. VicHealth’s experience
    is that innovative, evidence-based actions that empower healthy choices will be
    a key part of the solution to this critical issue.</p><p><em>Jerril Rechter is

  :title: Donald Trump Would Be a Terrible President and He Is a Cancer on the American
    Body Politic
  :content: '<p>There is no limit to what one can write about Donald Trump’s deficiencies.
    His time in the spotlight has made it clear that he is an awful human-resembling-thing,
    whose presidential run is more about himself and not at all about serving the
    country. Every day, it seems, Trump does something to confirm the impression that
    as a president, he would be out of his depth, and as a candidate, his strategy
    is to bring out the worst in the country he claims to want to lead–apparently,
    even Trump knows that his best chance of winning is to appeal to our baser instincts
    as a nation.</p><p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/03/donald-trump-just-tripped-up-on-the-air-over-foreign-policy-again-and-again/">The
    latest from Trump</a> demonstrates anew that he has no business being president
    of the United States, and that we would be fools to elect him:</p><blockquote><p><em>Donald
    Trump, leading in the polls and riding a wave of momentum in the race for the
    Republican presidential nomination, just hit a speed bump named Hugh Hewitt.</em><em>The
    conservative radio host peppered Trump with a host of foreign policy questions
    in a Thursday interview that produced some uncomfortable moments for the real
    estate mogul, who appeared upset at the line of questioning.</em><em>At one point,
    Hewitt asked Trump if he was familiar with “General Soleimani” and the “Quds Forces.”
    (He referred to Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, commander of the elite Quds
    Force of the Revolutionary Guard Corps.) Trump said he was but then appeared to
    mistake the Quds for the Kurds, a Middle Eastern ethnic group.</em><em>“The Kurds,
    by the way, have been horribly mistreated by us,” said Trump.</em><em>Hewitt corrected
    him: “No, not the Kurds, the Quds Forces, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Quds
    Forces.”</em><em>After that, Trump said he thought Hewitt said “Kurds.”</em><em>“No,
    Quds,” responded Hewitt.</em><em>Later on, Hewitt insisted he didn’t believe “in
    gotcha questions.” Trump disagreed.</em><em>“Well, that is a gotcha question,
    though,” he said. “I mean, you know, when you’re asking me about who’s running
    this, this this, that’s not, that is not, I will be so good at the military, your
    head will spin.”</em><em>Asked what he would do as president if China were “to
    either accidentally or intentionally sink a Filipino or Japanese ship,” Trump
    refused to say.</em><em>“I wouldn’t want to tell you, because frankly, they have
    to, you know, somebody wrote a very good story about me recently, and they said
    there’s a certain unpredictable, and it was actually another businessman, said
    there’s a certain unpredictability about Trump that’s great, and it’s what made
    him a lot of money and a lot of success,” said Trump. “You don’t want to put,
    and you don’t want to let people know what you’re going to do with respect to
    certain things that happen.”</em><em>Hewitt told Trump that when it comes to terrorism,
    “I’m looking for the next commander in chief, to know who Hassan Nasrallah is,
    and Zawahiri, and al-Julani, and al-Baghdadi. Do you know the players without
    a scorecard, yet, Donald Trump?”</em><em>Trump said he did not.</em></p></blockquote><p><a
    href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/09/04/in-radio-interview-trump-shows-what-a-know-nothing-he-really-is/">Jennifer
    Rubin</a> provides relevant portions of the transcript, along with her own commentary:</p><blockquote><p><em>This
    is embarrassing but hardly surprising. Trump has gotten away with his act because
    the press has not done its job nor have his competitors in exposing how little
    he knows and how unfit for office he is. We are in a war, so this is a particularly
    inappropriate time to have an ignoramus as commander in chief. But then he’d never
    get that far. Imagine him on the stage in a debate with Hillary Clinton. She’d
    look like Henry Kissinger in comparison. And she’d win in a landslide.</em><em>And
    for the record, after the Trump interview <a href="http://www.hughhewitt.com/carly-fiorina-on-gotcha-questions-and-the-rise-of-islamist-terrorism/">Carly
    Fiorina</a> answered the questions about terrorists with <a href="http://m.washingtonexaminer.com/carly-fiorina-takes-on-foreign-policy/article/2571432">aplomb</a>.
    Maybe the GOP rabble-rousers picked the wrong outsider. Each day Trump makes his
    followers look like buffoons, for why would any responsible voter take Trump seriously?</em></p></blockquote><p>Good
    question. Speaking of Trump’s voters, they are in for a good and righteous denunciation.
    This is the part where I turn over the microphone to <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-donald-and-the-demagogues-1441064072?cb=logged0.0706256062258035">Bret
    Stephens</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>If by now you don’t find <a href="http://topics.wsj.com/person/T/Donald-Trump/159">Donald
    Trump</a> appalling, you’re appalling.</em><em>If you have reached physical maturity
    and still chuckle at Mr. Trump’s pubescent jokes about Rosie O’Donnell or Heidi
    Klum, you will never reach mental maturity. If you watched Mr. Trump mock fellow
    candidate Lindsey Graham’s low poll numbers and didn’t cringe at the lack of class,
    you are incapable of class. If you think we need to build new airports in Queens
    the way they build them in Qatar, you should be sent to join the millions of forced
    laborers who do construction in the Persian Gulf. It would serve you right.</em><em>Since
    Mr. Trump joined the GOP presidential field and leaped to the top of the polls,
    several views have been offered to explain his popularity. He conveys a can-do
    image. He is the bluntest of the candidates in addressing public fears of cultural
    and economic dislocation. He toes no line, serves no PAC, abides no ideology,
    is beholden to no man. He addresses the broad disgust of everyday Americans with
    their failed political establishment.</em><em>And so forth and so on — a parade
    of semi-sophisticated theories that act as bathroom deodorizer to mask the stench
    of this candidacy. Mr. Trump is a loudmouth vulgarian appealing to quieter vulgarians.
    These vulgarians comprise a significant percentage of the GOP base. The leader
    isn’t the problem. The people are. It takes the demos to make the demagogue.</em><em>[.
    . .]</em><em>Because the Republican Party has not lost its mind — at least not
    yet — I doubt that Mr. Trump will be its presidential nominee. A single bad poll
    could break him. The summer before an election-year summer tends to be a political
    clown-time. Voters, like diners in a fancy restaurant, may entertain the idea
    of ordering the pigeon, but they’ll probably wind up with the chicken.</em><em>Still,
    Mr. Trump’s political star is rising in a period when fringe politics, both on
    the right and the left, are making a comeback in the West. Marine Le Pen in France.
    Beppe Grillo in Italy. Jeremy Corbyn in Great Britain. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic
    Party. Every now and then some of these characters get into office. Look at Viktor
    Orbán in Hungary, or Alexis Tsipras in Greece.</em></p></blockquote><p>The only
    potential problem with Stephens’s rhetoric is that he is not ruthless enough in
    describing the lunacy of Trump supporters. But perhaps that is not possible without
    actually resorting to a string of cuss words that would make even the most hardened
    cuss-word user blush.</p><p>It should surprise precisely no one, of course, that
    <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/252743-trump-hits-radio-host-hugh-hewitt-for-gotcha-questions">Trump

  :title: 'The myth of society: the social contract and the body politic'
  :content: '<p>Author’s note: This post is the first in a series which explores the
    political mythos which encompasses modern conceptions of society.</p><p>In a state
    of nature, potential is boundless. There are no gate-keeping titans to dismiss
    ideas as contrary to the public good. But there are no curators either, no channels
    for development. Instead, men must be ever vigilant of their property for there
    is no redress of grievance except force. The constant expenditure of energy on
    perpetually looking towards security prevents the individual from growing his
    potential for his fulfillment and betterment.</p><p>Western philosophy has presented
    the social contract and the creation of the body politic as the solution to this
    problem. In theory, the coalescing of individuals under a power which is superior
    to the force any of them can exert over another and which protects rights by using
    that power against any member who transgresses the rights of another, creates
    an egalitarian balance between an individual’s ability to exercise and be secure
    in their naturally-held liberties. As John Locke most famously <a href="http://libertyonline.hypermall.com/Locke/second/second-frame.html">summarized</a>:
    “When any number of men have so consented to make one community or government,
    they are thereby presently incorporated, and make one body politic, wherein the
    majority have a right to act and conclude the rest.”</p><p>On the surface, this
    seems like the height of democratic-egalitarian morality, sure to deliver those
    who freely choose to bind their interests under the body politic to an Elysium
    of justice and tranquility precluded to those who remain under the turbid dominion
    of nature’s anarchy.</p><blockquote><p>Subsequent generations, even in a free
    society, are governed by the discretion of those men who banded together to form
    the body politic. They are twice enslaved: ruled through temporal tyranny by the
    wills of those long dead and subjugated to the will of society’s majority.</p></blockquote><p>But
    there is nothing democratic about this system. It is impossible that, by ceding
    autonomy over his interests to an agency which exists above him, a person can
    be more secure in his liberty. An individual, as nature creates him, is a sovereign
    unit, capable of pursing his own needs and desires to whatever level he chooses.
    An individual in the body politic is a slave.</p><p>The body politic is simply
    the will of the majority. And, as Locke himself writes, the majority is able to
    conclude for the rest. This means that the dominant social power, which is not
    bound by the same natural limitations of man, exerts discretion in determining
    and enforcing laws. The social contract does not create egalitarianism; it creates
    a new and superior social entity. It robs each member of the body politic of a
    part of its will, grafts it into a chimerical organization which has power over
    and above the individual and then allows it to determine what is right or wrong
    under the law. This is not parity; this is hierarchy of the most despotic kind.</p><p>Yet,
    this basic hierarchical relationship is the root of society. Social contract theory
    is often offered as evidence which proves the basic beneficence of society. It
    is, after all, all-encompassing and altruistic in that it considers and promotes
    the rights and interests of each of its members equally. Clearly, however, equality
    depends on whose rights are primarily considered. Locke himself talks of the majority
    deciding for the minority. But because of the power imbalance created by the body
    politics dependence on the will of the majority, there is no mechanism which prevents
    the discretionary powers of the dominant social organs to relegate itself to enforcing
    the majority. Egalitarianism just as easily justifies unequal application of law
    as a means of creating greater social parity. The “majority” ceases to become
    a point of agreement among a plurality of the body politics members which fluctuates
    as individuals engage in discourse and change their view. It becomes a singular
    will conceived of in the artificially created mind of social powers and to be
    forced upon others. Society is no longer a protectorate for civil liberties; it
    creates and controls them.</p><p>Besides, to suppose that every individual borne
    into society has the same freedom of consent to the body politic’s dominion is
    also a fallacy. The progeny of the founders of a society are governed by the parameters
    of law setup by their forefathers. Their birth and democratic rights are interpreted
    as their tacit consent to be ruled by the body politic. But they have no means
    to challenge the foundational values and structure of society. Subsequent generations,
    even in a free society, are governed by the discretion of those men who banded
    together to form the body politic. They are twice enslaved: ruled through temporal
    tyranny by the wills of those long dead and subjugated to the will of society’s
    majority.</p><p>Social contract theory, then, does not protect men from the tyranny
    of force found in a state of nature. It merely destroys the balance which fear
    and mortality create among men and allows a prevailing will to mask itself behind
    moral ideas of equality and altruism and rule divorced from the constraints of
    natural decay.</p><p><em>Originally published at <a href="http://politicsofdiscretion.com/?p=102">The

    and Raqqa. They’re living side by side with the Iraqis and then Trump has a much
    publicized ban on Iraqi Muslims, all but declaring that they’re the enemy of the
    United States. Reasonably they might be worried that the local reaction of the
    Iraqi government and militia forces would be wildcat attacks on Americans. Even

    *<em>Pose estimation refers to computer vision techniques that detect human figures
    in images and video, so that one could determine, for example, where someone’s

    recognizing <em>who</em> is in an image — there is no personal identifiable information
    associated to pose detection. The algorithm is simply estimating where key body
    joints are.</p><p><strong>Ok, and why is this exciting to begin with?</strong>
    Pose estimation has many uses, from <a href="https://vimeo.com/128375543">interactive</a>

    While many alternate pose detection systems have been <a href="https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose">open-sourced</a>,

    anyone with a decent webcam-equipped desktop or phone can experience this technology
    right from within a web browser.</strong> And since we’ve open sourced the model,
    Javascript developers can tinker and use this technology with just a few lines
    of code. What’s more, this can actually help preserve user privacy. Since PoseNet
    on TensorFlow.js runs in the browser, no pose data ever leaves a user’s computer.</p><p>Before

    library.</p><h2>Getting Started with PoseNet</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet">PoseNet</a>
    can be used to estimate <strong>either</strong> a <strong>single pose</strong>
    or <strong>multiple poses</strong>, meaning there is a version of the algorithm
    that can detect only one person in an image/video and one version that can detect
    multiple persons in an image/video. Why are there two versions? The single person
    pose detector is faster and simpler but requires only one subject present in the
    image (more on that later). We cover the single-pose one first because it’s easier
    to follow.</p><p>At a high level pose estimation happens in two phases:</p><ol><li><p>An
    <em>input RGB image</em> is fed through a convolutional neural network.</p></li><li><p>Either
    a single-pose or multi-pose decoding algorithm is used to decode <em>poses, pose
    confidence scores</em>, <em>keypoint positions,</em>* **<em>and *keypoint confidence
    scores</em> from the model outputs.</p></li></ol><p>But wait what do all these
    keywords mean? Let’s review the most important ones:</p><ul><li><strong>Pose</strong>
    — at the highest level, PoseNet will return a pose object that contains a list
    of keypoints and an instance-level confidence score for each detected person.</li></ul><p><img

    strong enough.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keypoint Position</strong> — 2D x and y
    coordinates in the original input image where a keypoint has been detected.</p></li></ul><h3>Part
    1: Importing the TensorFlow.js and PoseNet Libraries</h3><p>A lot of work went
    into abstracting away the complexities of the model and encapsulating functionality
    into easy-to-use methods. Let’s go over the basics of how to setup a PoseNet project.</p><p>The
    library can be installed with npm:</p><pre><code>npm install @[tensorflow-models/posenet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow-models/posenet)</code></pre><p>and
    imported using es6 modules:</p><pre><code>import * as posenet from &#39;@[tensorflow-models/posenet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow-models/posenet)&#39;;const
    net = await posenet.load();</code></pre><p>or via a bundle in the page:</p><pre><code>&lt;html&gt;  &lt;body&gt;    &lt;!--
    Load TensorFlow.js --&gt;    &lt;script src=&quot;[https://unpkg.com/@tensorflow/tfjs](https://unpkg.com/@tensorflow/tfjs)&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;    &lt;!--
    Load Posenet --&gt;    &lt;script src=&quot;[https://unpkg.com/@tensorflow-models/posenet](https://unpkg.com/@tensorflow-models/posenet)&quot;&gt;    &lt;/script&gt;    &lt;script
    type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;      posenet.load().then(function(net) {        //
    posenet model loaded      });    &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre><h3>Part
    2a: Single-person Pose Estimation</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*SpWPwprVuNYhXs44iTSODg.png"
    alt="*Example single-person pose estimation algorithm applied to an image. Image
    Credit: “Microsoft Coco: Common Objects in Context Dataset”,[ https://cocodataset.org](http://cocodataset.org/#home).*"><strong>Example
    single-person pose estimation algorithm applied to an image. Image Credit: “Microsoft
    Coco: Common Objects in Context Dataset”,<a href="http://cocodataset.org/#home">
    https://cocodataset.org</a>.</strong></p><p>As stated before, the single-pose
    estimation algorithm is the simpler and faster of the two. Its ideal use case
    is for when there is <strong>only one</strong> person centered in an input image
    or video. The disadvantage is that if there are multiple persons in an image,
    keypoints from both persons will likely be estimated as being part of the same
    single pose — meaning, for example, that person #1’s left arm and person #2’s
    right knee might be conflated by the algorithm as belonging to the same pose.
    If there is any likelihood that the input images will contain multiple persons,
    the multi-pose estimation algorithm should be used instead.</p><p>Let’s review
    the <strong>inputs</strong> for the single-pose estimation algorithm:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Input
    image element *<em>— An html element that contains an image to predict poses for,
    such as a video or image tag. Importantly, the image or video element fed in should
    be *</em>square</strong>.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Image scale factor *</em>— A number
    between 0.2 and 1. Defaults to 0.50. What to scale the image by before feeding
    it through the network. Set this number lower to scale down the image and increase
    the speed when feeding through the network at the cost of accuracy.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Flip
    horizontal *</em>— Defaults to false. If the poses should be flipped/mirrored
    horizontally. This should be set to true for videos where the video is by default
    flipped horizontally (i.e. a webcam), and you want the poses to be returned in
    the proper orientation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Output stride</strong> — Must be
    32, 16, or 8. Defaults to 16. Internally, this parameter affects the height and
    width of the layers in the neural network. At a high level, it affects the <strong>accuracy</strong>
    and <strong>speed</strong> of the pose estimation. The <em>lower *the value of
    the output stride the higher the accuracy but slower the speed, the *higher</em>
    the value the faster the speed but lower the accuracy. The best way to see the
    effect of the output stride on output quality is to play with the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/demos/posenet/camera.html">single-pose
    estimation demo.</a></p></li></ul><p>Now let’s review the <strong>outputs</strong>
    for the single-pose estimation algorithm<strong>:</strong></p><ul><li><p>A pose,
    containing both a pose confidence score and an array of 17 keypoints.</p></li><li><p>Each
    keypoint contains a keypoint position and a keypoint confidence score. Again,
    all the keypoint positions have x and y coordinates in the input image space,
    and can be mapped directly onto the image.</p></li></ul><p>This short code block
    shows how to use the single-pose estimation algorithm:</p><pre><code>const imageScaleFactor
    = 0.50;const flipHorizontal = false;const outputStride = 16;const imageElement
    = document.getElementById(&#39;cat&#39;);// load the posenet modelconst net =
    await posenet.load();const pose = await net.estimateSinglePose(imageElement, scaleFactor,

    https://cocodataset.org</a></strong></p><p>The multi-person pose estimation algorithm
    can estimate many poses/persons in an image. It is more complex and slightly slower
    than the single-pose algorithm, but it has the advantage that if multiple people
    appear in a picture, their detected keypoints are less likely to be associated
    with the wrong pose. For that reason, even if the use case is to detect a single
    person’s pose, this algorithm may be more desirable.</p><p>Moreover, an attractive
    property of this algorithm is that performance is not affected by the number of
    persons in the input image. Whether there are 15 persons to detect or 5, the computation
    time will be the same.</p><p>Let’s review the <strong>inputs</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>*<em>Input
    image element *</em>— Same as single-pose estimation</p></li><li><p><strong>Image
    scale factor</strong> — Same as single-pose estimation</p></li><li><p><strong>Flip
    horizontal</strong> — Same as single-pose estimation</p></li><li><p><strong>Output
    stride</strong> — Same as single-pose estimation</p></li><li><p>*<em>Maximum pose
    detections *</em>— An integer. Defaults to 5. The maximum number of poses to detect.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pose
    confidence score threshold</strong> — 0.0 to 1.0. Defaults to 0.5. At a high level,
    this controls the minimum confidence score of poses that are returned.</p></li><li><p><strong>Non-maximum
    suppression (NMS) radius</strong> — A number in pixels. At a high level, this
    controls the minimum distance between poses that are returned. This value defaults
    to 20, which is probably fine for most cases. It should be increased/decreased
    as a way to filter out less accurate poses but only if tweaking the pose confidence
    score is not good enough.</p></li></ul><p>The best way to see what effect these
    parameters have is to play with the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/demos/posenet/camera.html">multi-pose

    with the PoseNet <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet/demos">demos</a>.</strong>
    *<em>This is probably a good stopping point. *</em>If you’re curious to know more
    about the technical details of the model and implementation, we invite you to
    continue reading below.</p><h2>For Curious Minds: A Technical Deep Dive</h2><p>In
    this section, we’ll go into a little more technical detail regarding the single-pose
    estimation algorithm. At a high level, the process looks like this:</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3074/1*ey139jykjnBzUqcknAjHGQ.png" alt="*Single
    person pose detector pipeline using PoseNet*"><strong>Single person pose detector
    pipeline using PoseNet</strong></p><p>One important detail to note is that the
    researchers trained both a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385">ResNet</a>
    and a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861">MobileNet</a> model of PoseNet.
    While the ResNet model has a higher accuracy, its large size and many layers would
    make the page load time and inference time less-than-ideal for any real-time applications.
    We went with the MobileNet model as it’s designed to run on mobile devices.</p><h3>Revisiting
    the Single-pose Estimation Algorithm</h3><p><strong>Processing Model Inputs: an
    Explanation of Output Strides</strong></p><p>First we’ll cover how to obtain the
    PoseNet model outputs (mainly heatmaps and offset vectors) by discussing <strong>output
    strides</strong>.</p><p>Conveniently, the PoseNet model is image size invariant,
    which means it can predict pose positions in the same scale as the original image
    regardless of whether the image is downscaled. This means PoseNet can be configured
    to have a <em>higher accuracy at the expense of performance</em> by setting the
    <strong>output stride</strong> we’ve referred to above at runtime.</p><p>The output
    stride determines how much we’re scaling down the output relative to the input
    image size. It affects the size of the layers and the model outputs. The <em>higher</em>
    the output stride, the smaller the resolution of layers in the network and the
    outputs, and correspondingly their accuracy. In this implementation, the output
    stride can have values of 8, 16, or 32. In other words, an output stride of 32
    will result in the fastest performance but lowest accuracy, while 8 will result
    in the highest accuracy but slowest performance. We recommend starting with 16.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3074/1*zXXwR16kprAWLPIOKCrXLw.png" alt="*The
    output stride determines how much we’re scaling down the output relative to the
    input image size. A higher output stride is faster but results in lower accuracy.*"><strong>The
    output stride determines how much we’re scaling down the output relative to the
    input image size. A higher output stride is faster but results in lower accuracy.</strong></p><p>Underneath
    the hood, when the output stride is set to 8 or 16, the amount of input striding
    in the layers is reduced to create a larger output resolution. <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/atrous_conv2d">**Atrous
    convolution</a>** is then used to enable the convolution filters in the subsequent
    layers to have a wider field of view (atrous convolution is not applied when the
    output stride is 32). While Tensorflow supported atrous convolution, TensorFlow.js
    did not, so we <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-core/pull/794">added
    a PR</a> to include this.</p><p><strong>Model Outputs: Heatmaps and Offset Vectors</strong></p><p>When
    PoseNet processes an image, what is in fact returned is a <strong>heatmap *<em>along
    with *</em>offset vectors</strong> that can be decoded to find high confidence
    areas in the image that correspond to pose keypoints. We’ll go into what each
    of these mean in a minute, but for now the illustration below captures at a high-level
    how each of the pose keypoints is associated to one heatmap tensor and an offset
    vector tensor.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3074/1*mcaovEoLBt_Aj0lwv1-xtA.png"
    alt="*Each of the 17 pose keypoints returned by PoseNet is associated to one heatmap
    tensor and one offset vector tensor used to determine the exact location of the
    keypoint.*"><strong>Each of the 17 pose keypoints returned by PoseNet is associated
    to one heatmap tensor and one offset vector tensor used to determine the exact
    location of the keypoint.</strong></p><p>Both of these outputs are 3D tensors
    with a height and width that we’ll refer to as the <strong>resolution</strong>.
    The resolution is determined by both the input image size and the output stride
    according to this formula:</p><pre><code>Resolution = ((InputImageSize - 1) /
    OutputStride) + 1// Example: an input image with a width of 225 pixels and an
    output// stride of 16 results in an output resolution of 15// 15 = ((225 - 1)
    / 16) + 1</code></pre><p><strong>Heatmaps</strong></p><p>Each heatmap is a 3D
    tensor of size <strong>resolution x resolution x 17</strong>, since 17 is the
    number of keypoints detected by PoseNet. For example, with an image size of 225
    and output stride of 16, this would be 15x15x17. Each slice in the third dimension
    (of 17) corresponds to the heatmap for a specific keypoint. Each position in that
    heatmap has a confidence score, which is the probability that a part of that keypoint
    type exists in that position. It can be thought of as the original image being
    broken up into a 15x15 grid, where the heatmap scores provide a classification
    of how likely each keypoint exists in each grid square.</p><p><strong>Offset Vectors</strong></p><p>Each
    offset vector is a 3D tensor of size <strong>resolution x resolution x 34</strong>,
    where 34 is the number of keypoints * 2. With an image size of 225 and output
    stride of 16, this would be 15x15x34. Since heatmaps are an approximation of where
    the keypoints are, the offset vectors correspond in location to the heatmap points,
    and are used to predict the exact location of the keypoints as by traveling along
    the vector from the corresponding heatmap point. The first 17 slices of the offset
    vector contain the x of the vector and the last 17 the y. The offset vector sizes
    are in <strong>the same scale as the original image.</strong></p><p><strong>Estimating
    Poses from the Outputs of the Model</strong></p><p>After the image is fed through
    the model, we perform a few calculations to estimate the pose from the outputs.
    The single-pose estimation algorithm for example returns a pose confidence score
    which itself contains an array of keypoints (indexed by part ID) each with a confidence
    score and x, y position.</p><p>To get the keypoints of the pose:</p><ol><li><p>A
    <strong>sigmoid</strong> activation is done on the heatmap to get the scores.scores
    = heatmap.sigmoid()</p></li><li><p><strong>argmax2d</strong> is done on the keypoint
    confidence scores to get the x and y index in the heatmap with the highest score
    for each part, which is essentially where the part is most likely to exist. This
    produces a tensor of size 17x2, with each row being the y and x index in the heatmap
    with the highest score for each part.heatmapPositions = scores.argmax(y, x)</p></li><li><p>The
    <strong>offset vector</strong> for each part is retrieved by getting the x and
    y from the offsets corresponding to the x and y index in the heatmap for that
    part. This produces a tensor of size 17x2, with each row being the offset vector
    for the corresponding keypoint. For example, for the part at index k, when the
    heatmap position is y and d, the offset vector is:offsetVector = [offsets.get(y,
    x, k), offsets.get(y, x, 17 + k)]</p></li><li><p>To get the <strong>keypoint</strong>,
    each part’s heatmap x and y are multiplied by the output stride then added to
    their corresponding offset vector, which is in the same scale as the original
    image. keypointPositions = heatmapPositions * outputStride + offsetVectors</p></li><li><p>Finally,
    each <strong>keypoint confidence score</strong> is the confidence score of its
    heatmap position. The <strong>pose confidence score</strong> is the mean of the
    scores of the keypoints.</p></li></ol><h3>Multi-person Pose Estimation</h3><p>The
    details of the multi-pose estimation algorithm are outside of the scope of this
    post. Mainly, that algorithm differs in that it uses a <strong>greedy</strong>
    process to group keypoints into poses by following displacement vectors along
    a part-based graph. Specifically, it uses the <strong>fast greedy decoding</strong>*
    <em>algorithm from the research paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08225.pdf">*PersonLab:
    Person Pose Estimation and Instance Segmentation with a Bottom-Up, Part-Based,

    our hope that as more models are ported to TensorFlow.js, the world of machine
    learning becomes more accessible, welcoming, and fun to new coders and makers.
    PoseNet on TensorFlow.js is a small attempt at making that possible. We’d love

    also convinced that being familiar with cognitive sciences is one of the key skills
    of any designer. To better myself professionally and perhaps to help other people
    learn something new, I decided to write about the cognitive topics I am interested
    in.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/8000/1*-agEWwfDJfDPyZBkHXFvng.jpeg"

    Neel</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>Although
    the design is perceived by our senses (vision, touch, hearing), it is immediately
    processed by our brain. As designers, we have to understand how to create experiences
    that go hand in hand with how the human brain evaluates them. While being a designer,
    you have the power to control the human mind during and even beyond the interaction
    with the product.</p><p>In this article I am focusing on how our attention works
    and on the ways that affects interface design.</p><h2>Attention = working memory</h2><p>Everything
    we see, hear, touch or smell is processed by our brain and affects our memory
    system. This system is divided into:</p><ul><li><p>working memory</p></li><li><p>short-term
    memory</p></li><li><p>long-term memory</p></li></ul><p>Working memory contains
    information about the focus of our attention. As the capacity of our working memory
    is rather small (research shows the capacity can range between 5–7 unrelated concepts),
    our attention is considerably selective. Our brain is simply not able to process
    all that is happening around us at once. It is instead narrowing down its focus
    to the most relevant pieces of information. The relevancy is determined by our
    own objectives.</p><blockquote><p>Our brains receive about 11 million bits of
    data per second, but we’re only able to process roughly 50 bits per second.</p></blockquote><p>Information
    from the working memory can be lost very easily if the focus shifts. Many of us
    can relate to a situation like this one:</p><blockquote><p>In the middle of counting
    someone suddenly interrupts you. Afterwards you have to start all over again,
    because you don’t remember exactly where you left off.You walk into a room, suddenly
    realising you have forgotten the reason you went there in the first place.</p></blockquote><h2>Working
    memory in interface design</h2><h3>Modes</h3><p>Using modes in design has many
    advantages. It allows us to perform more actions with fewer gestures/controls
    by switching contexts. For example, in „Sketch“, a graphic design app, you find
    yourself in select mode by default. What this means is that while dragging, you
    can select objects on the screen. However, if you go into draw rectangle mode,
    it means that now while dragging, you can draw a rectangle.</p><p>The working
    memory is too volatile to assume that the users can remember in which mode they
    currently are without having any feedback. When using modes, it is important to
    emphasize the currently active mode. <em>Sketch</em> has mastered this by showing
    a different cursor for each mode.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2050/1*P6IjomTY9wWPyFlmn7QHmw.png"
    alt="Rectangle mode, select mode, drag mode in Sketch."><em>Rectangle mode, select
    mode, drag mode in Sketch.</em></p><h3>Search</h3><p>While using the search function
    on a website, users enter the search terms and then review the results. The attention
    shifts from the input to the results. That means the users often forget what the
    initially typed search parameters were. Sites with a search function should have
    the input parameters displayed prominently even when already showing the search
    results.</p><h3>Instructions</h3><p>If the user needs to go through more than
    5 steps to achieve their goal, make sure they have clear instructions on how to
    do that. Users most certainly will not be able to remember all the incremental
    steps. It should also be possible for the user to easily review the instructions
    as they are executing them.</p><h3>Navigation</h3><p>If the system you are designing
    requires a complex navigation hierarchy, it should give the user feedback on where
    they currently are and how they got there. It might be rather challenging to remember
    all the steps you took before ending up on this exact page. The designer should
    do their best to avoid overloading the user’s brain and letting them forget what
    their initial objective was. That is why breadcrumbs (usually arrows or slashes
    which show the hierarchy of a page)are getting very popular in many products nowadays.</p><p><img

    of breadcrumbs as well as highlighted menu and submenu item."><em>In Edookit teacher
    system you can clearly see where you currently are with the help of breadcrumbs
    as well as highlighted menu and submenu item.</em></p><h2>Vision – eye fovea</h2><p>Nowadays,
    our brain gets most of its information through the eye. Our eyes play an important
    role in how we perceive design. The structure of the human eye is complex, but
    the most important finding is that there is a part of the eye called an <strong>“eye
    fovea”</strong> in the central part of the eye. It is a small circle (1.5 mm wide)
    and it is the part through which our brain gets most of its information. There
    are 3 reasons for this:</p><ol><li><p>This small part of the eye has a significantly
    bigger resolution than the rest of it.</p></li><li><p>The cells in the fovea are
    also connected 1:1 to the ganglial nerve (which transfers information to the brain),
    which is why they don’t have any data compression — in contrast with other parts
    of the eye.</p></li><li><p>The fovea is only about 1% the size of the entire eye,
    but the visual cortex of our brain devotes 50% of its resources to it.</p></li></ol><p>All
    of this results in humans having a very narrow focus.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*hK2DLnrLkHn8NqPOerQLug.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Our peripheral vision, on the other hand, is very poor. Really.
    Think about the way you are reading this article right now. You are focused only
    on these exact words, everything else is irrelevant. That is a tiny part of the
    overall design. The interesting part, though, is that our brain tries to help
    the eyes and fills out the missing data from our periphery based on our expectations
    and memory. This tricks us into thinking that we actually see everything at once,
    sharply.</p><p>Even though the peripheral vision is poor in quality, it does have
    a purpose in our lives. It guides the fovea towards focus points (where to look
    next) based on low resolution data. It is also very good at detecting motion —
    an ability we inherited from our ancestors who lived in the wilderness.</p><h2>The
    effect of the eye fovea on interface design</h2><p>These findings are easily applicable
    to design. Users are not able to see the whole website at once. They can merely
    scan the page. That means their eyes jump very fast from one part to another.
    The most attractive usually is the part of the website that is in contrast or
    involves any kind of motion.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6000/1*7GY0X0QXjXKL1BiLbWbnWg.png"
    alt="The landing page of Semplice has a yellow CTA button in the right corner.
    It immidiatelly takes our attention."><em>The landing page of Semplice has a yellow
    CTA button in the right corner. It immidiatelly takes our attention.</em></p><p>Important,
    mutually related information has to be shown in a compact way, so that users can
    perceive these elements together. Use the gestalt principle of proximity that
    says:</p><blockquote><p>Objects or shapes that are close to one another appear
    to form groups.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*v84sLoJK8HotkN6vUhpopQ.jpeg"
    alt="Gestalt principle of proximity. Circles closer together appear to be grouped."><em>Gestalt
    principle of proximity. Circles closer together appear to be grouped.</em></p><p>For
    example, an error message has to be shown near the password field. A user that
    is focused on typing the password might miss the error message if it is in a different
    part of the page. Another example (image below) is the marketing copy which should
    persuade the user to click the CTA buttons. The contrast of the heading and the
    CTA button implies that this part of the page is likely to be one of the first
    ones to be noticed by the user.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/1*Zc3g8JXaX_NOr4WEBIh-rw.png"

    doesn&#39;t have to move his eyes far away."><em>The error message is shown directly
    underneath the input field. The user doesn&#39;t have to move his eyes far away.</em></p><h2>Inattentional
    blindness</h2><p>Human attention is goal-oriented. We tend to focus on things
    related to the achievement of our goals. Everything else is less relevant and
    unless it somehow triggers our attention, it will stay on the sidelines. This
    results in a psychology phenomenon called perceptual or inattentional blindness.</p><p>Watch
    this video and try to count the passes of the white team.</p><p><center><iframe
    width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-Dg-06nrnc" frameborder="0"
    allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p><p>We should aim to design with interconnectedness
    in mind, for example by employing the gestalt principle of proximity. If it is
    not possible, we should attract the user to change with motion or contrast. Unless
    we adhere to these principles, there is data out there that says the user is highly
    likely to miss important details of the experience.</p><p>This is the end of me
    rambling about human attention and how recent findings in cognitive sciences affect
    the way we design. In writing this piece, I was heavily inspired by the book “<em>Designing
    with the Mind in Mind”</em> by Jeff Johnson. If you are curious how to design

  :title: Why I Will Always Love My Ex-Boyfriends
  :content: '<p>hermetic hermit</p><p>Years ago as I curled up next to my then-beau,
    we started on that inevitable conversation of past loves. At that point I only
    had one — one that left me on Halloween evening, sobbing and throwing up on the
    corner of Times Square, devastated and broken.</p><p>“I hate him,” I said, tears
    forming as I clung closer to that new beau, naively convinced that his warmth
    and sympathy would heal the damage done by the last.</p><p>“The opposite of love
    isn’t hate, sweetheart,” he said, quoting cliche. “It’s indifference.”</p><p>As
    if by survival instinct, we tend to categorize past lovers and flames as mistakes,
    passionate flaws, and delusions. And when an ex-lover comes into conversation,
    supportive friends are wired to respond with: “Screw that awful guy. He was horrible.”
    As if negativity erases the pain. I’m not alone in this.</p><p>Memories are not
    stagnant. They ebb and morph depending on what you choose to focus on. And if
    your ex-lovers’ flaws are your focus, then that will become your memory. After
    all, it’s the stories that we tell ourselves that shape our past.</p><p>But the
    truth is, at one point in time I was in love. You know, the type of euphoric bliss
    that was weekends on the couch, giggling to Demetri Martin recordings while piecing
    together gorgeous Thomas Kinkade puzzles. The type where you can spend all day
    doing absolutely nothing but feel so incredibly present and alive. When something
    as simple as picking peaches in your backyard becomes the most vivid memory of
    your life. You remember everything — from the exact hue of the sky that day down
    to the taste and texture of that ripe peach, its juices shattering, sweet and
    a little bit of sour, in your mouth.</p><p>You see, I loved these people for their
    soul, their kindness, their quirks, their heart. And they, at one point, loved
    me for the same.</p><p>When things fell apart, my journal was taken over with
    violent, angry scribbles. Because nothing hurts your pride more than a broken
    relationship that you worked hard on, and a broken heart is an agony that throws
    you into an unusual, almost spiritual, hysteria.</p><p>Extreme conclusions were
    formed in a desperate attempt to regain control of my life. I wrote: “He’s cold-hearted.”
    “He has serious issues.” “He’ll never be in a successful relationship.” Or at
    my worst, I’d blame myself. “I should’ve broken up with him sooner.” “I hate myself
    for settling for him.” “I think he resented me. What did I do wrong?”</p><p>I
    started hating them, wishing them the worst, hoping that they would realize their
    lesson in some cruel karma-driven way. I shielded myself in a bitter angry sheet
    of resentment. Focusing on the negatives was a coping mechanism because it’s easier
    to deal with than the truth. And the truth is this: things just didn’t work out.
    It is what it is.</p><p>But these days, long after the dust has settled, I find
    myself still enjoying Demetri Martin. I’ve noticed I’ve picked up some of the
    habits and interests and tendencies of my past loves: I can’t sit on my bed without
    changing into clean clothes. I sometimes think in an Australian accent (an inside
    joke). I really like Artic surf clams, and I adore taro pastries. These are all
    remnants of these men — habits that have been etched into my own identity. These
    people are a part of who I am, even though I no longer have a desire to reconnect
    with them, even though I no longer share with them any part of my life.</p><p>And
    I love them. That emotional attachment though, which is necessary for any healthy
    relationship, is no longer there. I no longer would want to spend all evening
    making dinner for them, or care to hear about their day-to-day life. I would never
    drive hours to see them and when I think about it, I don’t have anything to say
    to them anymore.</p><p>Time did that trick. And for those who are still in the
    throes of a painful breakup, rest assured that time’s medicinal effects will eventually
    kick in. It always does. Humans, after all, are hardwired to overcome heartbreak.</p><p>I
    love them for who they were, in the time that they were in my life. I love them
    in the sense that I’m extremely thankful for all the beauty that I experienced
    between us. And all the things I loved about them? Their heart, their soul? That
    all still holds true. These are brilliant men with vibrant souls. But of course,
    as life teaches us, sometimes love is just not enough. Situations, timing, place,
    and priorities are all important factors.</p><p>Sometimes love isn’t strong enough,
    sometimes it’s unequal. Sometimes it creates resentments that are permanent and
    sometimes trust and passion is eroded so slowly by simple neglect that you don’t
    notice until it’s too late, until you both come to the acute conclusion that you
    cannot coexist in the same world without devastating each other and so you part
    permanently and painfully.</p><p>And all the negatives? The hurtful things that
    were said and done by both parties? Well, I forgive them, and more importantly,
    I forgive myself.</p><p>They say love is an action and my action is this: respecting
    the past.</p><p>I’m making a conscious effort not to bash these guys in front
    of my friends, and I’m altering our stories to one that isn’t steeped in resentment.
    He wasn’t horrible, he wasn’t insane. He wasn’t severely selfish, he wasn’t always
    cold. He was human, as am I, and we realized that we just don’t work well together.</p><p>Sure
    the opposite of love is indifference, but love, if it was true, doesn’t go away.
    And the best thing to do, I find, is to honor love and put it in a nice, quiet
    corner as a reminder of what transpired.</p><p>Don’t cover love with a blanket.
    It’s who you are, stitched into your identity.</p><p>So to my past, I wish you
    the best. Cheers to happiness and joy and for both of us, to one day finding a
    great, fiery love that works.</p><p>This piece originally appeared on <a href="http://www.xojane.com/relationships/why-i-will-always-love-my-ex-boyfriends">xoJane</a>.</p><p><em>If

    Journaling</h2><p>You’d think that sitting down and putting pen to paper wouldn’t
    be that life-changing of a practice.</p><p>But trust me, without it you wouldn’t

    allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p><p>So if journaling helped me build a big
    audience online, what can it help you do?</p><p>In this article you’ll learn four
    things..</p><ol><li><p>Why journaling’s the secret to <strong>not getting angry/upset
    much</strong> anymore.</p></li><li><p>How it can show you <em>why certain strategies
    work and don’t work</em>.</p></li><li><p>How writing <strong>can teach you to
    be more “present”</strong> in your everyday life.</p></li><li><p>How journaling
    will help you become <em>incredibly self-aware</em> (the MOST IMPORTANT benefit
    by a long-shot).</p></li></ol><h2>You’ll Stop Getting Angry And Upset</h2><blockquote><p>I
    won’t lie, my first month of journaling was basically just me screaming headfirst
    into a blank book (with my pen).</p></blockquote><p>I was furious at the world.</p><p>Turns
    out I had a lot of anger/frustration to get out, and it showed.</p><p>Then I started
    to notice something..</p><p>I didn’t get angry much anymore. I stopped having
    big showdowns with my friends and actually maintained a mellow sort of mood all
    the time.</p><blockquote><h1>A few weeks later I realized that journaling was
    actually helping me get my frustration out before I could direct it at anybody
    else.</h1></blockquote><p>In short, writing was therapy.</p><p>What a novel idea.</p><p>Pun
    wasn’t intended, but let’s roll with it.</p><h2>You’ll Start Understanding Why
    Certain Strategies Work And Don’t Work</h2><blockquote><p>My <a href="https://findingtom.com/lessons-learned-blogging/">biggest
    quarrel with bloggers</a> these days is that they don’t do enough tweaking. Like,
    if your posts aren’t doing well, maybe you should tweak the headline, the picture,
    the way you write, the formatting, etc. etc.</p></blockquote><p>But they don’t
    do this.</p><p>They just keep doing the same thing over and over again and then
    they wonder why their posts aren’t performing better.</p><blockquote><h1>One of
    my secrets is that I used daily journaling to write down what blog posts I wrote
    that day, how my previous posts performed, and what I think I need to change to
    get more views/fans/highlights/etc.</h1></blockquote><p>That’s all.</p><p>Then
    I came up with ideas, used them, recorded how they impacted future posts, then
    kept getting better and better day-by-day.</p><blockquote><p>Journaling doesn’t
    just have to be about recording your emotional soliloquies on a white page. It
    can be used as a business strategy as well.</p></blockquote><p>This highlights
    a key benefit to journaling that REALLY ties into my last point..it helps you
    <strong>reflect ***(and we don’t do enough of that)</strong><em>.</em>*</p><h2>You’ll
    Actually Live In The Moment More</h2><blockquote><h1>Journaling does this incredible
    fucking thing in that it helps you start to understand how you actually feel about
    friends, family, and co-workers after doing it for a few weeks.</h1></blockquote><p>You
    THINK you know how you feel about these people, but let me assure you that you
    have no freaking clue.</p><blockquote><p>Letting thoughts run through our mind
    can be a visceral experience. We may think back to an old memory, or an old lover,
    or we may think about something that hasn’t happened at all and find ourselves
    in a deep emotional rut because of it.</p></blockquote><p>I call it zoning the
    F out.</p><p>Happens to me all the time.</p><p>Letting your thoughts run through
    your mind is like sifting for gold in a river with your bare hands..</p><blockquote><h1>Something
    incredibly valuable may have been in your hands/possession at some point, but
    you probably never knew it because you don’t have that necessary tools to capture
    it. And like that it’s halfway down the river never to be seen again.</h1></blockquote><p>Journaling
    puts these visceral thoughts on paper so they don’t get away.</p><p>I’m sure you
    can remember a time where you had a conversation with someone and they interrupt
    you and then you can’t remember the REALLY IMPORTANT thing you were about to say
    to them.</p><blockquote><p>Then it bugs you for five minutes and because your
    brain is old now it’s lost forever, never to be seen again.</p></blockquote><p>Same
    thing happens to our thoughts.</p><p>Turns out we have numerous realizations/straight-up
    discoveries about our friends/family that enter and leave our mind in a hurry.</p><blockquote><h1>When
    we write we focus on the details. We write about the little idiosyncrasies of
    an interaction with someone. And most times when journaling we write while the
    interaction is still FRESH in our minds.</h1></blockquote><p>This strengthens
    our observation muscle.</p><p>Then we start looking for little details in our
    next interaction.</p><p>An eyebrow raise. A smile. How they always eat the same
    thing for lunch every day.</p><p>We’re just strengthening that observation muscle
    more and more — it’s something you won’t understand until you start journaling
    for a long time.</p><h2>We Become More Self-Aware</h2><p>Self-awareness is touted
    by self-help gurus like <a href="undefined">Gary Vaynerchuk</a> as one of the
    MOST IMPORTANT traits to have for success.</p><p>Why does journaling increase
    self-awareness?</p><blockquote><h1>Like I said before — letting thoughts run through
    our mind is one thing, but recording them is like stepping in wet concrete.</h1></blockquote><p>The
    outline of our foot is now there forever.</p><blockquote><p>After one month of
    journaling, I stopped getting angry at people. After three months of journaling,
    I knew traveling/adventure was what brought me the most joy. After 8 months of
    journaling, I realized that maybe writing is what I should do for the rest of
    my life.</p></blockquote><p>A lot of people get beaten down by their thoughts.
    Me? I have a full-blown recorded conversation with them. I spar. I find weaknesses
    — flaws. I find opportunities.</p><p>Every time I step in the ring with my mind
    I get hurt, but I find out that much more about myself by the time I’m done.</p><p>Competing
    in a boxing match will always hurt, but there’s also always a winner.</p><p>After
    I got into the habit of daily journaling, I started winning for a change.</p><blockquote><h1>I
    realized I’m actually an ultra-sensitive dude and that maybe I should use that
    instead of shy away from it like “strong male” stereotypes are “supposed” to do.</h1></blockquote><p>I
    realized I’m too loyal. I realized I’m stubborn, and prideful, and a stupid young
    person. I realized I said shit two months ago that I disagreed with later, and
    that caused me to humble myself big time.</p><blockquote><p>It also helped me
    realize that what we believe now isn’t always what we’re going to believe tomorrow.</p></blockquote><p>Feelings
    are like the seasons — they come and go. People come and go. Family normally always
    stays.</p><p>I started getting slapped in the face by life itself. I started getting
    challenged. I started realizing that I don’t have it all together and I realized
    that you just can’t BE somebody else — you have to be yourself and accept that
    you just aren’t like that guy or girl you admire.</p><blockquote><h1>I realized
    all these things — some of the hardest truths about life — alone in a quiet room
    with nothing but a pen and a journal.</h1></blockquote><p>Everybody wants to better
    themselves. They make grand plans to do so and it almost always falls apart.</p><p>I
    promise you the quickest way to bettering yourself is to write.</p><p>If you want
    to speed that up, try writing online.</p><p>Here you aren’t just sparring with
    your mind, you’re sparring with other people’s minds in the comments and they
    aren’t afraid to tell you you’re dead wrong.</p><p>In fact, a lot of people quite
    enjoy it.</p><p>So here’s to writing — the thing that’s made me who I am, and
    the thing that’ll make me who I’ll be tomorrow.</p><blockquote><p><em>Want to

    alt=""></p><p>The divisiveness of our time is one that we have to deal with head
    on, and most of our leadership (on both sides of the isle) are unwilling to pick
    at old wounds. The frameworks that are being recommended are, in my opinion, flawed
    for the 21st Century mainly because of the new and unavoidable tools that we have
    at our disposal. Tools like, transparency of human activity, as a result of the
    use of devices to capture our every move and socialize them… Tools like, the lowering
    of sovereign and economic borders as a result of our digital transaction of both
    information and capital…</p><p>In the 21st Century I think that in order to enjoy
    the fruits of our distribution of economic and technological innovations, we first
    have to reconcile with each other over the lack of access people have had socially
    and politically.</p><p>That stated, all ideologies are being branded in line with
    the 20th Century and triggering dangerously familiar sentiments among our tribes.
    My candidacy and life’s work is involved with providing common way forward that

    măsură ce simţi sau ce gândeşti în legătură cu unele lucruri la care te-ai referit.
    Dar aş vrea să nu facem presupuneri. Este bine să îmi scrii / spui cât de bine
    am înţeles până acum şi să mă ajuţi să te înţeleg mai bine. Cu cât mai mulţi participanţi
    fac lucrul ăsta, cu atât mai bine se construieşte o conversaţie.</p><ol><li>Te-ai
    referit la competenţa de a-i alege pe “cei mai potriviți oameni pentru a ocupa
    o anumită funcție”.</li></ol><p>Din rândurile tale se poate presupune că îţi doreşti
    să alegem oameni cât mai potriviţi pentru funcţiile de îndeplinit în echipele
    statale.</p><p>1.1 Acelaşi lucru mi se pare de dorit şi în echipele private.</p><p>1.2
    De mult comunic despre lucrul ăsta, pentru că vreau servicii mai bune. Şi prestatorul
    trăieşte mai bine când desfăşoară activităţile potrivite.</p><ol><li>“mijloace
    pașnice”</li></ol><p>2.1 Cu mine poţi să comunici şi despre chestiuni lingvistice.</p><p>De
    exemplu, în acest context sunt corecţi termeni care nu cuprind “corona”.</p><p>2.2
    Modul de exprimare într-o anumită limbă diferă considerabil de la un vorbitor
    / scriitor la altul.</p><p>Îmi place cum scrii, iar expresia aceasta mi se pare
    chiar potrivită în discuţia aceasta.</p><p>2.3 Putem să purtăm o discuţie largă,
    iar echipele mele pot să îndeplinească astfel de sarcini:</p><p>2.3.1 să cerceteze
    în măsura în care i se cere, astfel încât beneficiarul să înţeleagă mai bine ce
    se întâmplă;</p><p>Unii spun că au murit 534.491 de oameni din cauza virusului
    2 cu coroană. Alţii că numărul acesta este calculat imprecis, de exemplu pentru
    că e greu de spus că asta ar fi fost cauza morţii.</p><p>În acelaşi timp, anul
    acesta au murit cam 30 de milioane de oameni din cauze deja existente, iar populaţia
    a crescut cu 40,5 milioane de oameni. Unii spun că această creştere ultrarapidă
    a populaţiei favorizează infectarea oamenilor cu microorganisme patogene.</p><p>2.3.2
    să îşi noteze ce beneficii îţi doreşti şi să întreprindă acţiuni care să te ajute
    să le obţii într-o măsură cât mai mare, în condiţii cât mai bune, cu costuri cât
    mai mici şi în termen cât mai scurt.</p><ol><li>Te-ai referit la cunoașterea legilor
    fundamentale ale psihicului uman.</li></ol><p>Sunt interesat de psihologie şi
    cred că legile acestea trebuie să fie cunoscute şi urmate. Poţi să zăboveşti asupra
    acestei teme.</p><p>Despre pacea de la punctul 2:</p><p>Ce schimbări ale societăţii
    noastre ar fi folositoare?</p><p>Ce tensiuni trăieşte un român şi cum riscă acestea
    să îi tulbure viaţa / activităţile?</p><ol><li>Ai scris: “bolnavii nu sunt tratați
    în mod corespunzător pentru […] că statul român nu dispune de mijloace.”</li></ol><p>E
    o discuţie foarte complexă. Sunt dispus să purtăm o discuţie detaliată, în care
    recunoaştem multe legături, de exemplu între sănătate şi alte părţi ale vieţii.
    Costurile comunicării trebuie să fie într-un raport bun cu beneficiile acesteia.
    Comunic ca să obţinem beneficii, adică mă interesează partea practică, zilele
    în care vom îmbunătăţi serviciile medicale pentru cetăţenii români şi zilele în
    care ne vom bucura cu toţii de acele servicii superioare.</p><p>Deşi mă interesează
    şi conversaţiile despre lucruri referitoare la un număr mai mare de oameni, cu
    tine aş comunica în primul rând despre ce beneficii vrei pentru tine (şi alte
    câteva persoane). Pe baza aceasta se organizează gestionarea resurselor private
    şi a celor publice. Cu cât sunt gestionate mai bine datele, cu atât mai utile
    sunt acordurile încheiate şi cu atât mai realiste sunt hotărârile luate, de exemplu
    cine şi cum să prevină îmbolnăvirile şi vătămările, respectiv cine şi cum să ne
    trateze.</p><p>Ca să îmbunătăţim serviciile medicale pentru români trebuie să
    ştim să trăim. Adică trebuie în primul rând să comunicăm mai bine unii cu alţii.
    Pentru că nu e uşor nici măcar să stabilim obiectivele, iar planul de atingere
    a acestora este foarte greu de făcut. Una din greutăţi va fi teama de schimbare,
    mai mult ori mai puţin raţională.</p><ol><li>Ai scris că avem un “prim-ministru
    incoerent”.</li></ol><p>5.1 Îmi pare bine când văd exprimare corectă. Unii “jurnalişti”
    spun: primul ministru; dar se referă la unul care nu-i nici primul ministru al
    României, nici ultimul. Este vorba de ministrul prim / întâi. Să folosim cuvintele
    în forma corectă şi cu sensul potrivit!</p><p>5.2 Ţine seama de faptul că îţi
    susţin părerea şi că replica unui om este probabil de obicei destul de întâmplătoare!
    Adică o să mă refer la un aspect din multe şi o să mă exprim într-unul din felurile
    în care e posibil să mă exprim. Scriu şi vorbesc mult. Toate cuvintele împreună
    pot să mă reprezinte. Ce scriu în acest mesaj nu are cum să mă descrie complet.</p><p>Ce
    legături vezi între miniştrii României şi beneficiile şi costurile tale? Putem
    să vorbim cât de aplicat vrei, ca să mărim beneficiile şi să micșorăm costurile.</p><ol><li><p>Pentru
    mine inteligenţa a contat mereu. Dacă ai şti unele cuvinte pe care le-am spus
    de prin 1996 încoace… Rămâi la tema asta cât vrei! Cred că discuţia va fi interesantă

    alt=""></p><h2>Un análisis en profundidad de la novedad electoral que se apoderó
    de las elecciones primarias. Para qué los usan los partidos y la opinión de expertos.</h2><p>Un
    grupo de militantes se sube a una camioneta con un tacho de engrudo y cuando la
    ciudad duerme en encargan de empapelar cada centímetro de pared posible. Al día
    siguiente, los vecinos salen a la calle y se encuentran con el rostro del candidato
    sonriente que, quizás así, suma algún voto.</p><p>Esa imagen tan instalada en
    la carrera presidencial argentina hoy es otra. Ya no se necesita la camioneta,
    ni el tacho de engrudo, ni los afiches, ni la logística para detectar paredes
    a empapelar.</p><p>Alcanza con una foto del candidato, un celular, una lista nutrida
    de contactos en WhatsApp, buen pulso para recortar un figurín y ya. <strong>Bienvenidos
    a la “campaña *meme”</strong>*.</p><p>Los** stickers de políticos llegaron para
    quedarse y están en todo lados**, viralizándose en cuanta conversaciones haya.</p><p>Los
    usan políticos, militantes, empresarios, famosos. Se envían a listas de difusión,
    grupos de mamis y papis del colegio, de fútbol, y para re-convencer a convencidos
    y persuadir a los indecisos para que voten a un candidato.</p><p>Son la nueva
    versión de los afiches de la militancia: d<strong>escontracturados, instantáneos,
    divertidos, irónicos, bizarros</strong> y -sobre todo- <strong>reenviables</strong>.</p><p>Negocio
    político que puede mover miles de pesos y, al mismo tiempo, oficio casi artesanal
    de militantes con menos recursos, *<em>Clarín *</em>habló con políticos, voceros,
    consultores y militantes para mostrar cómo los usan y para qué sirven, si es que
    sirven, los stickers de las elecciones 2019.</p><p>Hay de Macri, Cristina Kirchner,
    Alberto Fernández, Lavagna, Urtubey, Pichetto, Kicillof, Vidal, Carrió, Del Caño,
    Castañeira, Espert, y cuanto político aparezca. También de figuras históricas
    que ya no están como Raúl Alfonsín, Néstor Kirchner, Juan Domingo Perón. Y, cómo
    no, de sindicalistas, como los Moyano, Hugo y Pablo, por poner el ejemplo más
    viral.</p><h2>La palabra de un gurú</h2><p><strong>Antoni Gutiérrez-Rubí</strong>,
    consultor que ablandó la imagen de Cristina Kirchner en 2017 y también asesoró
    a Sergio Massa antes de su regreso al kirchnerismo analizó el fenómeno de los
    stickers políticos. “Estas pequeñas pegatinas digitales podrían convertirse en
    parte fundamental de los contenidos políticos que veamos de ahora en adelante”,
    sostuvo en un <a href="https://www.gutierrez-rubi.es/2018/11/19/los-stickers-y-la-politica/">**artículo
    titulado “Los stickers y la política”</a>.**</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*toHDOgpKbjlkRY7qfAFJTw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>El consultor catalán desglosó el impacto de esa nueva forma de comunicación
    política en cuatro puntos:</p><p><strong><em>-Personalización</em></strong>: a
    diferencia de los emojis, que viene predeterminados en las aplicaciones de chats,
    los stickers potencian la “habilidad creativa y originalidad” al punto de ponerlas
    al alcance de cualquier persona. <strong>“Veremos grandes, ocurrentes y muy imaginativas
    pequeñas obra”</strong>, dice.</p><p><em>**-Paquetes originales</em><em>:</em>
    cada político o partido puede generar su propio paquete fácilmente sincronizables
    con WhatsApp. Ejemplos sobran en diferentes países: en Estados Unidos, Donald
    Trump, Hillary y Berni Sanders, los explotaron en Telegram. En Brasil, Jair Bolsonaro,
    hizo lo propio en WhatsApp al punto de que, en la última semana de campaña, el
    término “figurinhas Bolsonaro whatsapp” fue el sexto más buscado en Google.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*5msbguGQC9fDDq-NJJeyVw.jpeg" alt=""></p><p><strong><em>-Lenguaje
    propio:</em></strong> dice Gutiérrez-Rubí que lo visual predomina en el mundo
    digital. Por esa razón, “resulta fácil, rápido e incluso divertido, el hecho de
    crear y compartir un sticker, ya que al ser tomados de imágenes espontáneas pueden
    transmitir un sentimiento de manera más precisa que un emoji, un meme o incluso
    un GIF”. Para el consultor, no se puede ignorar “el gran potencial” de los stickers
    que define como un “<strong>elemento lúdico innegable, con una alta capacidad
    de interacción con nuestra comunidad</strong>”.</p><p><strong><em>- Viralización
    y movilización:</em></strong> los stickers políticos sirven para que las bases
    participen del proceso de comunicación de manera activa, no solo replicando y
    viralizando las imágenes diseñadas desde el comando de campaña, sino también convirtiéndose
    ellos mismos en una fábrica de contenido. “Herramientas como esta propician la
    <strong>activación de activistas y <em>artivistas</em> digitales que desean movilizar</strong>
    a la sociedad en pro de una causa, una idea o un candidato/a”, explica el consultor.</p><p>“Nos
    enfrentamos a nuevos retos que, por su atractivo lúdico y su capacidad viral,
    se convertirán en ideogramas (signo esquemático no lingüístico que representa
    globalmente conceptos) de la sociedad digital”, explica Gutiérrez Rubí.</p><p>Para
    él, se da la siguiente paradoja: “En tiempos de abundancia de contenidos y palabras,
    los stickers — con su poderoso magnetismo — van a tener una <strong>capacidad
    de sintetizar en formato visual nuestras conversaciones. También las políticas</strong>.
    O especialmente las políticas”.</p><h2>Los candidatos y los stickers</h2><p>Todos
    los partidos políticos y la gran mayoría de los principales candidatos usan stickers
    de WhatsApp. La aplicación de chats encriptada es uno de los principales escenarios
    de lucha por el voto en el contexto de la campaña en redes sociales.</p><p>Ya
    lo dijo Marcos Peña en su arenga al interior de Juntos por el Cambio: “Hoy nos
    pasamos <strong>cuatro meses al año mirando la pantalla del celular. El 90% de
    la gente usa WhatsApp; 80%, Facebook y el 70%, instagram</strong>”.</p><p>La consigna
    de mudar la campaña a los celulares hace que estos pequeños figurines digitales
    esten de moda y tanto la militancia, como los propios políticos, los piden.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*_7W3H-Fyk9jo0SZUJW0pMg.png" alt=""></p><p>“El
    uso de sticker empezó a** sonar fuerte a principios de año y los candidatos los
    quieren<strong>. Nosotros ofrecemos ese servicio”, explica a **Clarín</strong>
    Federico Salcedo, director de la agencia de comunicación Atlas SmartCities.</p><p>El
    trabajo viene con una aclaración previa: las reglas de lo políticamente correcto
    se corren en el mundo WhatsApp y es posible que algún sticker los haga enojar.
    Son las reglas del juego. “<strong>Les decimos que necesitan saber reírse de uno
    mismo</strong>, que es algo inofensivo, y al mismo tiempo aceptar las propias
    debilidades. Vos vas a <strong>armar un pack y la oposición va a armar otro en
    contra tuya</strong>, a esos los llamamos stickers destructivos”, agrega.</p><p>“El
    sticker te da horizontalidad y cercanía, te permite simplicar valores, palabras
    y sensaciones en una sola imagen. Su uso confirma que <strong>predomina la imagen
    en la campaña</strong>”, sigue Salcedo, que trabaja para diferentes políticos
    en todo el país.</p><p>Para él, esas miniaturas virales se dividen en tres tipos:</p><p><strong>-Por
    la positiva:</strong> para transmitir valores como esperanza o alegría.*<em>​-Por
    temas: *</em>por ejemplo, para mostrar preocupación por jubilados o los jovenes.*<em>​-Por
    la negativa: *</em>son stickers cuyo objetivos es criticar o satirizar sobre la
    oposición.</p><p>“Esto es con humor, siempre, es un** instrumento sarcasmo, la
    ironía le da vida, si es aburrido no funciona**”, aclara el asesor de campaña,
    que define a los sticker como “emojis personalizados” y aclara que esto no tiene
    que ver con una cuestión etaria, entre jóvenes y viejos”.</p><h2>Virales profesionales
    y artesanales</h2><p>Hay de todo en el mundo de los stickers de campaña. Están
    los que apelan a <strong>servicios tercerizados</strong> de emojis personalizados
    de WhatsApp, como <strong>Juntos por el cambio y el Frente de Todos</strong>;
    y también los que reciben figurines virales artesanales, hechos por los propios
    militantes, quienes de manera casera los meten de lleno en la conversación electoral.</p><p>“Gracias
    al crecimiento y desarrollo del 4G y de los smartphone, esta campaña estará marcada
    por un nuevo actor que en las anteriores tuvo mucha menor relevancia: <strong>WhatsApp,
    que además atraviesa a todos los sectores sociales y económicos</strong>, por
    eso incentivamos a los militantes y adherentes a que participen y así se fueron
    generando stickers”, explica Matías Mendez, asesor experimentado en campañas,
    que trabaja para Juntos por el Cambio en este 2019.</p><p>“Algunos los hicieron
    los equipos de los candidatos pero la gran mayoría van circulando sin tener claro
    el autor”, dice.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*CJsT1VTKKMke4V7aJDw0Xg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Marcos Peña lanzó semanas atrás una aplicación para celulares para
    fidelizar a la militancia. Uno de los métodos para sumar “defensores del cambio”
    es a través de Stickers oficiales. <strong>“Descargá el pack y usarlos en tus
    conversaciones”</strong>, invita la app.</p><p>El paquete de JxC es acotado. Son
    apenas 19 figuritas en las que se muestran algunos rostros icónicos de Macri (como
    cuando lloró en el Teatro Colón o cuando se saludo con Cristina Kirchner), algunos
    slogans de campaña como “<strong>¿En que te han convertido?</strong>”, célebre
    frase dicha a Scioli en el debate presidencial, <strong>“Yo defiendo el cambio”</strong>,
    y <strong>“Yo no vuelvo atrás”</strong>; y caritas de Miguel Ángel Pichetto, Horacio
    Rodríguez Larreta, Patricia Bullrich, y Elisa Carrió.</p><p>En el Frente de Todos,
    una empresa digital llamada *<em>“El Pueblo Vence” *</em>es la encargada de diseñar
    y distribuir los stickers oficiales de la campaña K.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*4T-M2bNkf-svD2maW5qiGw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>La firma se dedica al negocio de los stickers no solo en Argentina.
    En México, hicieron los de la campaña de Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) y
    son los responsables de los stickers de Cristina, de Lula, de Perón, Evita, Fidel
    y el Che, y de Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Las figuras verificadas de Alberto Fernández,
    Cristina, Kicillof y demás candidatos pueden obtenerse bajando una aplicación
    con el pack entero (para los usuarios de Android) o enviado un mensaje de WhatsApp
    a un número telefónico que desata una catarata de emojis K personalizados en tu
    chat.</p><p>El paquete oficial del kirchnerismo lleva más de** 10 mil descargas<strong>,
    una cifra que parece mínima si se tiene en cuenta otro dato. **“El pueblo vence”</strong>
    es autora de los <strong>stickers del gato,</strong> un paquete de imágenes irónicas
    contra Macri y las principales figuras del Gobierno que lleva más de 500 mil descargas.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ZmERdgizBLMnV_jeaRvBKg.png" alt=""></p><p>En
    las fuerzas con menos recursos, las bases son las que producen los virales. En
    el Nuevo MAS, fuerza de Manuela Castañeira, la única mujer precandidata presidencial,
    apuestan a lo artesanal. “Nuestros sticker los hacen la militancia desde abajo,
    la juventud,** les jovenes, como les decimos nosotros, les <em>secus</em>**”,
    dicen.</p><p>Para ellos, esa unidad mínima de comunicación gráfica “reflejan momentos
    políticos, emociones, y los usan para eso. Por ejemplo, hay un nieto recuperado
    y se viraliza el sticker de Manu con Norita (Cortiñas). <strong>Es una forma divertida
    y nueva de hacer política,</strong>está bueno porque es una de las forman de la
    juventud que tienen para transmitir su política”, explican.</p><p>Aunque no haya
    unidad en la izquierda, la idea es la misma en el FIT, que postula a Nicolás del
    Caño como precandidato presidencial. “<strong>No es que tenemos gente lanzando
    eso, pero surgen y la enorme mayoría son buena onda y divertidos</strong>. Más
    bien surgen de abajo y eso nos gusta. Cómo el trap de Nico o la canción que hizo
    flor Alcorta. Sumamos todo lo que llega de original desde abajo”, explican.</p><p>Esa
    orfebrería digital no es patrimonio único de quienes buscan la abolición del sistema
    capitalista. Del otro lado del dial político, en el liberalismo a ultranza de
    José Luis Espert y su frente Despertar, hacen lo mismo. “Para nosotros, es una
    de las novedades de la campaña. <strong>Sabemos que una imagen vale más que mil
    palabras, e inmersos en la era de los ‘<em>memes</em>’, donde una imagen <em>trash</em>
    se vuelve viral para resignificarse y multiplicar su impacto</strong>, los stickers
    son livianas perlitas que habitan las conversaciones de WhatsApp creativos, espontáneos,
    se viralizan, de eso se trata”.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*i2Km6EhmIY7Y5wsBLHuIRw.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Si de imagen trash se habla, el economista al que sus seguidores
    más jóvenes llaman “Profesor” es uno de sus exponentes. En sus emoticones personalizados
    se lo puede ver como el increíble Hulk; repartiendo choripanes, haciendo el festejo
    de Usain Bolt, boxeando o con un cartón de vino Uvita.</p><p>Hasta en el mundo
    sindical la moda fue adoptada por los principales gremios. El consultor <strong>Diego
    Serrano</strong> es especialista en comunicación sindical y desde hace décadas
    asesora a una veintena de sindicatos. En ese ámbito, los stickers también tiene
    algo para decir.</p><p>“Se viralizan de una manera amigable en el mundo gremial,
    el de Perón, el de <strong>Hugo y Pablo Moyano, son los más proliferan</strong>,
    no vi ninguno de Cavalieri, ponele”, explica y cuenta que hay dirigentes que hasta
    se los envían a empresarios en sus siempre tensos diálogos con paritarias.</p><p>“Hay
    una nueva conducción sub40 que se mueve en los grupos de WhatsApp,ellos nos piden
    utilizar emojis, comunicación no escrita, visual. Son símbolos que los dirigentes
    se apropian y tiene que ver un cambio generacional y con establece empatía. Los
    hijos les mandan stickers”, detalla el portavoz de varios sindicatos.</p><h2>Pero…
    ¿da votos?</h2><p>¿Sirven para algo? Todos los políticos los tienen, pero la pregunta
    es si suma votos.** Juan Ignacio Belbis<strong>, director del Observatorio de
    redes, lo explica así: “El ‘sirven’ está atado a un para qué. Si sirve para cambiar
    percepción del votando o influir en la cantidad de votos **me atrevo a decir que
    no</strong>, sirven para movilizar a la militancia, más en el términos negativos”.</p><p>“Los**
    memes suelen moverse más cuando son para reírse** y en este caso suele ser negativo
    para el sujeto que es parte de la imagen”, dice Belbis. “Es muy complejo en el
    caso de las campañas y siempre suele ser una preocupación es cómo medís. Es imposible
    medir el uso y a partir de eso hacer una correlación entre quien lo usa”, sigue.</p><p>En
    definitiva, para él, los stickers son “una <strong>buena herramienta para convencidos</strong>
    por positivo o negativo para que reproduzcan ese mensaje de estar convencidos.</p><blockquote><p><em>Los
    stickers son un negocio: en 2016, la app Line ganó 270 millones de dólares solo
    en la venta de stickers, según <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vivianrosenthal/2016/08/19/why-emojis-and-stickers-are-big-business/#299153449651">**publicó
    la revista Forbes</a></em><em>.</em></p></blockquote><p>La especialista en medios
    <strong>Adriana Amado Suárez es tajante</strong>: los stickers de ninguna manera
    sirven para sumar votos. Así desglosa su significado: “Su rol es doble: primero
    primero porque es una narrativa de redes sociales, es <strong>condensada, breve,
    no pesa nada, se puede compartir indiscriminadamente</strong> y puede ser entendida
    más allá de las palabras, vos lo abrís y sabes de qué se trata, ese valor tienen”.</p><p>“Por
    otro lado tiene la condensación del humor y son imbatibles, porque las redes abiertas
    es mas difícil manejar ironías porque te vienen las acusaciones de la gente que
    se siente herida porque te estas burlando de alguien que para ellos es importante”,
    analiza. “Lo que permite WhatsApp [red encriptada y cerrada] es <strong>ejercer
    con más libertad el humor, por eso las propias fuerzas son las que usan stickers
    irónicos de su propio líder</strong>, algo que nunca harían en redes abiertas”,
    agrega.</p><p>Todos los candidatos los tienen, pero no sirven para ganar votos.
    “Hay que descartar cuando se habla del tema cualquier suspicacia alrededor de
    manipulación, ningún sticker cambia la opinión. Lo que te permite ver es qué grupo
    es seguro para expresar tu opinión”, explica Amado Suárez.</p><p><strong>“No hay
    un arma electoral con el tema de los stickers”</strong>, sentencia la autora del
    libro <em>**Política Pop: de líderes populistas a telepresidentes *</em><em>y
    concluye: “Esta circulando esa idea con relación a trolls,a los mensajes de WhatsApp,
    a la manipulación, son ideas falsas, indemostrables alrededor de la fantasía de
    Cambridge Analytica que creo que tienen que ver con que hay muchos que se preparan
    par aun *</em>resultado que no les va a gustar **por eso se vienen atajando como
    hicieron en Brasil y EEUU que en vez de entender que la sociedad esta expresando
    algo prefieren creer que la sociedad es tonta o se la manipula con una figurita
    de WhatsApp”.</p><p>Con la campaña cerrada y a días de ir a las urnas, los stickers
    siguen circulando en WhatsApp. Para ellos no hay veda, siguen replicándose en
    los chats, buscando convencer a un indeciso o riéndose de una campaña <strong>donde
    faltan propuestas, pero sobran los memes.</strong></p>'

  :content: '<p>By Michelle Maiese and Robert Hanna</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2528/1*-tabQMjgA574WcBg8QtHDQ.png"
    alt=""></p><h3><strong><em>“The Mind-Body Politic</em>,” by Michelle Maiese and
    Robert Hanna, is now available from Palgrave Macmillan, <a href="https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9783030195458">HERE</a>.</strong></h3><h3><strong>And
    a preview is also available, <a href="https://www.academia.edu/38764188/The_Mind-Body_Politic_Co-authored_with_Michelle_Maiese_Born_on_the_4th_of_July_2019_and_Now_Available_From_Palgrave_Macmillan_At_URL_https_www.palgrave.com_us_book_9783030195458_">HERE</a>.</strong></h3><h2><strong>PREFACE</strong></h2><p>A
    few months ago, Michelle asked her students, on the first day of their Fall Semester
    class on “Theories of Human Nature,” to consider their <em>level of agreement</em>
    with respect to a series of claims about human nature and motivation. The four
    corners of her classroom were labeled “Strongly Agree,” “Agree,” “Disagree,” and
    “Strongly Disagree.” As she read out each claim, students moved to different parts
    of the classroom. Some topics were more controversial than others. When it came
    to God and gender, for example, views were highly mixed. Some students indicated
    their strong belief that in order to gain a better understanding of human nature,
    we need to talk about God, whereas others said that they thought God was irrelevant.
    Some students expressed their belief that human nature did not vary according
    to biological sex, whereas others said they believed that there were inborn differences
    between men and women.</p><p>One topic, however, attracted widespread agreement:
    “In their natural state, humans are fundamentally competitive and self-interested.”
    At this point in the class, almost all of the students were huddled together under
    the “strongly agree” or “agree” labels. When asked to explain why they agreed,
    several students cited our human drive to survive, and also added that their primary
    reasons for attending college were to compete in the workforce and advance their
    own interests.</p><p>A few of them lingered in the center of the classroom, which
    Michelle had designated as a space for those who were uncertain. One of the students
    said she thought that parents sometimes exhibited genuine self-sacrifice, but
    then a student who “strongly agreed” with the statement expressed a classical
    Hobbesian view nowadays called “psychological egoism”: she asserted that all human
    choice and action are inherently self-interested and that even behavior that <em>appeared</em>
    altruistic was in fact motivated, at bottom, by self-interest.</p><p>Why are so
    many of us convinced that this Hobbesian view is true? And why is it that whenever
    contemporary college or university professors query students about their reasons
    for pursuing post-secondary education, they begin to describe their future career
    plans without missing a beat? Why do other concerns — such as becoming a more
    informed voter or a more engaged citizen; gaining knowledge about social injustice;
    being able to think more critically about politics and current events; pursuing
    a morally good life; or crafting a meaningful philosophy of life — so rarely even
    <em>get mentioned</em>?</p><p>To be sure, these concerns have not <em>completely</em>
    disappeared from the lives of people under the age of 40. Look, for example, at
    the sharp rise in interest in <em>democratic socialism</em> and <em>social anarchism</em>
    (aka <em>anarcho-socialism</em>) displayed by millennials since the Occupy movement
    in the late 00s, and especially since The Age of Trump-POTUS began in 2016. However,
    it’s clear that the <em>main *focus of these current students lies elsewhere,
    namely on their future career prospects. As a result, their natural curiosity
    and love of learning for its own sake, or for the sake of other higher intrinsic
    values like “living a good life” or “living a meaningful life,” has greatly diminished,
    and many even view their university education as nothing but a burden that they
    must endure. It’s something that they *have to do</em>, and that they <em>dread</em>,
    as part of the obligatory pathway to “gainful employment.” They resent being told
    that it’s a privilege or that they are lucky to be in college or university. Even
    those few who retain their love of learning for its own sake, or who still think
    about living a morally good life or crafting a meaningful life-philosophy, come
    to view their stint in higher education in largely instrumental terms, as nothing
    but a means to an end.</p><p>For many or even most of them, the very idea of making
    carefully thought-out choices about which academic programs to pursue, in light
    of their unique interests and passions, is largely irrelevant; above all, they
    think they need to follow a path that will lead them to a comfortable middleclass
    or upper-middleclass lifestyle. Subjects like philosophy, which offer no such
    clear path to this goal — or even worse, which may seem to offer only a long and
    winding road <em>away</em> from this goal — take on an air of futility, or at
    best, of mystery. “What can you <em>do</em> with a degree in philosophy?” students
    and administrators alike frequently ask. And if a professor replies that someone
    can do <em>anything</em> after majoring in philosophy, people are likely to be
    deeply dissatisfied with this response. Whereas philosophy once was thought to
    play a crucial role in critical, reflective self-knowledge and in educating people
    for their role as citizens, today’s all-encompassing emphasis on economic “innovation”
    and competitiveness, <em>as an inevitable feature of human life</em>, can make
    studying or pursuing philosophy seem like an utter waste of time and effort. Unfortunately,
    and not surprisingly, many colleges and universities are responding to this “crisis
    in the humanities” by cutting back, or even eliminating, their philosophy programs.</p><p>According
    to this way of thinking, going to college or university is just for <em>professional
    advancement *and *landing a “good” job</em>, and even more distressingly, it’s
    not *only *the students who think so. During professional academic faculty and
    administrative meetings, there is all-too-frequent talk about “competitor schools,”
    “value for the money,” “sustainability,” and the need for “a return on investment.”
    Educational “outcomes” increasingly are defined and assessed in relation to what
    sort of job undergraduate students have obtained one to five years after graduation.
    At tuition-driven liberal arts colleges, in particular, professors and administrators
    need to be very skillful at gauging the level of student interest in various subjects,
    and tailoring their curriculum to whatever the students say they want. There is
    a demand to “market” their courses, their departments, and their colleges and
    universities, so that students will show up in sufficient numbers and they won’t
    have to close their doors. The sad and even tragic fact is that at most contemporary
    institutions of higher education, a department’s “performance” is measured solely
    by the number of undergraduate majors and graduates, the total number of students
    enrolled in courses, the number of graduate students who get professional academic
    jobs, the number of publications produced by faculty members, and discipline-wide
    rankings.</p><p>Perhaps most sadly or tragically of all, many contemporary professional
    academic faculty members actually <em>embrace</em> this way of thinking with enthusiasm,
    unabashedly speaking <em>not</em> about the intrinsic value of their subject,
    but instead about how their programs will “increase enrollments,” tap into new
    “markets,” or provide significant career preparation, thereby satisfying all-important
    “learning outcomes.” These trends are so pervasive and prominent, in fact, that
    even those professional academic <em>philosophers</em> who deeply resent and want
    to resist this market-driven orientation, also feel a strong need, when pushed
    into a corner, to defend themselves in terms of the very thing they most despise,
    in their heart of hearts; that is, they are driven to assert that studying or
    pursuing philosophy is, in fact, <em>great preparation for getting a good job</em>.
    Recently, one of Michelle’s friends and colleagues told her that, given economic
    pressures surrounding student loans, high rates of unemployment, and stagnating
    wages in many fields, <em>we have no choice</em> but to adopt a capitalist, market-driven
    orientation.</p><p>No doubt the economic pressures are real; but it appears that
    many of us have adopted this view of higher education rather unthinkingly or wholeheartedly,
    not as a regrettable response to economic realities, but rather as the “natural”
    way to view the world. Such observations indicate that a new and pervasive kind
    of social reality has emerged, one in which every aspect of human life is managed
    and evaluated in relation to market demands. Market logic now prevails in higher
    education, and many professors now understand the university’s role in society
    primarily in relation to capitalist economic imperatives. Other sorts of values
    that might be associated with a higher education, such as developing a capacity
    for critical inquiry, civic engagement, and the interrogation of the fundamental
    assumptions and values of one’s society, have begun to fade from sight. Aristotle’s
    claim that knowledge of the world around us is good for its own sake, regardless
    of its instrumental usefulness, and Kant’s even bolder claim that we should dare
    to think and know for ourselves — <em>Sapere aude!</em> — not only for its own
    sake, but also for the sake of “the highest good” of rational, moral, and political*
    enlightenment<em>, have come to seem virtually incomprehensible to many. Even
    those of us who agree with Aristotle or Kant are likely to find, upon honest self-critical
    reflection, that we all-too-frequently view our teaching and scholarship primarily
    as a means to an end — to get promoted, publish our work in high-status journals,
    gain professional prestige and higher salaries, and perhaps even become a *professional
    academic</em> <em>philosophy</em> <em>superstar.</em></p><p>But why has this market
    orientation become so dominant and widespread? Why do we think that the <em>economic</em>
    dimension of life is both fundamental and inevitable? And is it true that <em>we
    have no choice</em> but to adjust our thoughts, affects, and actions accordingly?
    Not surprisingly, the causes and deeper explanation lie in the larger “real world”
    outside the professional academy. More precisely, we strongly believe that these
    attitudes are largely the result of a larger, worldwide moral, political, and
    economic ideology known as “neoliberalism” (also known as “neoconservativism”
    or “centrism”). In the USA, in particular, this insidious set of ideas, values,
    and assumptions began to take hold in the late 1970s, became widespread in the
    1980s, and increasingly has been guiding our thought and action ever since.</p><p>On
    this neoliberal view of things, economic efficiency is the highest value, capitalist
    market considerations always take priority, and market-interference or regulations
    should be avoided wherever possible — except, of course, whenever <em>protectionist</em>
    policies are deemed necessary for cornering a market and making a profit. Needs
    formerly met by public agencies, or via government provision, or through personal
    relationships in communities and families, are now supposed to be met by private
    companies selling services. Neoliberalism in its specifically democratic guise
    emphasizes the values of individualism, self-reliance, consumerism, and personal
    gain; and these market values significantly determine what we regard as rational
    and responsible forms of human agency. It is considered “rational and responsible,”
    for example, to focus on increasing one’s own “human capital,” and downright <em>irrational</em>
    and <em>irresponsible</em> to engage in either short-term activities or life-pursuits
    that are not valued in the marketplace. “Success” consists essentially in having
    a nice home, a fancy car, stylish clothing, lots of extra money to spend on brief,
    furtive holidays and trendy leisure, and a large and ever-increasing number of
    followers on social media. And then personal and collective happiness are assumed
    to flow directly from such “success.”</p><p>This way of thinking has become so
    customary and widespread that one can rightly say it is now part of our cultural
    everyday <em>common sense</em>. It is deeply embedded in the workings of various
    social institutions, including the health care system, the educational system,
    and the political system. It fundamentally guides political discourse and action,
    heavily influences pop culture, and shapes our various modes of social interaction.
    It is so all-pervasive and ingrained, in fact, that, like white noise, it all-too-often
    escapes detection. What is more, even though it continues significantly to determine
    how we think, feel, and behave, we rarely stop to ask whether its influence is
    beneficial or harmful.</p><p>In <em>The Mind-Body Politic</em>, we use fundamental
    ideas in the <em>philosophy of mind</em> in order to formulate and defend the
    thesis that the influence of neoliberal ideology is largely <em>destructive and
    deforming</em>, and that it prevents us from fulfilling our true human needs.
    Instead of motivating us to seek work that we love and find inherently meaningful
    and self-sustaining — call it <em>lifework</em> — it prompts us to seek out careers
    with the highest pay check and/or highest social status, even if they are what
    David Graeber has aptly dubbed “bullshit jobs” — namely, jobs that are basically
    meaningless and unproductive, even though they may pay very well and/or look impressive
    on our <em>Curriculum Vitae</em> and resumes. Rather than promoting intimate human
    relationships, empathy, solidarity, and collective action as inherently good and
    meaningful, neoliberalism primes and encourages mutual antagonism, egoism, “winner-takes-all”
    competition, “networking,” and endless, robotic efforts to increase our “social
    capital.”</p><p>Part the reason why this ideology has become so dominant and pernicious
    is that it is so all-pervasive. Like white noise, or the air we breathe, it generally
    escapes our self-conscious notice and therefore also hides from our critical scrutiny:
    it has become so commonplace that many of us simply cannot even <em>imagine</em>
    things otherwise. And like racism, sexism, ableism, xenophobia, and other rationally
    unjustified and immoral ideologies and practices that violate <em>human dignity
    *and *oppress</em> people, it all-too-frequently remains hidden from critical
    consciousness and popular consciousness alike. But how can a set of ideas, attitudes,
    and practices become so dominant that it turns into white noise, even as it continues
    to *harm us *in fundamental ways?</p><p>The short-and-snappy version of the answer
    we are offering in this book is: because these ideas, attitudes, and practices
    <em>are realized in social institutions</em>, and because <em>social institutions
    literally shape our minds</em>, very often without any self-conscious awareness
    whatsoever of their influence on the part of the people affected. Furthermore,
    we believe that this process of mind-shaping is as much emotional and bodily as
    it is cognitive and intellectual, and that social institutions exert their formative
    influence by cultivating a specific <em>affective orientation</em>. We begin with
    the commonsense observation that social relationships and norms have a powerful
    <em>molding effect</em> on the human mind. From our earliest days, we look to
    other people for approval and recognition. Our caregivers direct our attention
    to various objects, we mimic their facial expressions and gestures, and we learn
    how to use tools by watching others use them. Over the course of learning and
    socialization, we acquire various bodily skills and habits that allow us to engage
    effectively with our surroundings. Through our embodied interactions with others,
    we also develop characteristic attitudes and affective stances and particular
    ways of interpreting objects and events. Over time, we gain a feel for the “rules
    of the game” associated with various social contexts and deepen our understanding
    of how we are expected to behave. Once we have <em>internalized</em> various social
    norms and rules, we can function more effectively in various social settings without
    having to pause and think about what to do next. These ingrained patterns of feeling,
    thought, and behavior shape our sense of what is possible and appropriate and
    comprise our habitual ways of understanding ourselves and our world. But at the
    same time, the habits of mind that have been cultivated via the rules, laws, and
    basic structures of social institutions take on a socially-created existence and
    life of their own and make it difficult for us to feel, think, and act otherwise.
    Ultimately, then, the many social institutions that we belong to literally shape
    our minds, and thereby fundamentally affect our lives, for worse or better.</p><p>In
    order to escape from the social institutions that shape people’s minds <em>for
    the worse</em>, and in order to build new social institutions that shape people’s
    minds <em>for the better</em>, we need to gain a deeper understanding of the complex,
    multifaceted, psychological and social dynamics at play. How do social norms and
    cultural values mold our feeling, thought, and behavior? How does inhabiting a
    particular social institution shape the way that we selectively attend to and
    interpret our surroundings, focusing on some considerations while ignoring others?
    What is it about social interaction and the influence of other people’s emotions,
    desires, and expectations that exerts such a strong influence over us?</p><p>After
    an Introduction that’s intended to provide the reader with a general theoretical
    and practical orientation for understanding our philosophical project, we move
    onto an examination of the mind-shaping influence of contemporary neoliberal social
    institutions that overtly or covertly coerce and mentally enslave us. Here we
    hope to shed philosophical light on how this big-capitalist market orientation
    has become so influential, how it has modified people’s outlooks and actions,
    and how it impedes and undermines human flourishing, self-realization, and solidarity.
    In particular, we will discuss how this way of viewing the world has infiltrated
    higher education and mental health practice, so much so that those who belong
    to these institutions frequently adopt this perspective as if it’s just a matter
    of common sense.</p><p>Then we proceed to describe what we take to be the central
    features of constructive, enabling social institutions that cultivate our capacities
    for autonomy and empathy, and radically liberate us. And finally, we offer substantive
    suggestions about how we can begin to create and sustain these emancipatory social
    institutions. Transformative education, we believe, not only <em>can be</em> but
    also <em>should be</em> life-changing and world-changing, and thereby can serve
    as a model for emancipatory social institutions more generally. This in turn expresses
    our radical “philosophy of philosophy,” which unabashedly asserts it to be a critical
    and reflective enterprise that is at once intellectual, practical, essentially
    embodied, and fully affective.</p><h2>***</h2><h2>AGAINST PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHY

  :title: OUNA- SHAPING THE FUTURE OF HUMAN RESOURCES
  :content: <p>The most valuable resource of many organizations is the human factor
    — the people employed within them. The abilities to source, engage, and retain
    qualified talents are some of the main catalysts in driving the long-term success
    of an organization. With fierce competition for talents across all industries,
    the ability to source suitable talents is a top priority in organizations of all
    sizes.</p><p>Nowadays, the available processes in the market for human resource
    recruiting are imperfect and suffer from various inefficiencies. These processes
    are highly dependent on human judgement, use tools and technologies that don’t
    provide sufficiently accurate matching results for employers and employees, are
    not intuitive, are very costly and timeconsuming, and have low success rates.</p><p>Recruiting
    criteria-matching talents for employment positions is a high-risk process, since
    recruiting the wrong person has the potential to severely damage the productivity
    of teams, lose clients, reduce efficiencies, increase costs, and lower profits.</p><p><strong>OUNA
    will be the first-of-its-kind blockchain-based, peer-to-peer HR assessment and
    recruitment ecosystem</strong>. The core of the OUNA platform is based on a novel
    algorithm, referenced as the “Analyzer”.** The Analyzer is an online Pyramidal
    Assessment tool that is based on 15 years of research and tested in more than
    100 real-life case studies.** During this assessment period, the Analyzer consistently
    generated candidate profiles for recruitment which resulted in an average success
    rate of 86% in compatibility between employers and their employees, validating
    the algorithm’s ability to accurately match employees’ skills with employers’
    requirements. In 2017, the IP for the Analyzer algorithm was acquired by OUNA
    with the aim of establishing the OUNA ecosystem, the first decentralized platform
    for precise peer-to-peer HR recruitment.</p><h2>EMPLOYEES</h2><p>Job-seekers can
    now choose to perform OUNA’s anonymous, global, decentralized Pyramidal Assessment.
    The online assessment utilizes 12 key parameters, and 40 significant skills are
    taken into consideration. The results are a uniquely accurate candidate profile,
    with an average validity of 86% — achieved while the profile remains totally anonymous.
    All this helping employees to identify and strive towards their ideal career destinies.</p><h2>EMPLOYERS</h2><p>By
    utilizing the OUNA platform, employers can now determine the perfect employee
    profile for each of their available positions. Harnessing OUNA’s comprehensive
    candidate assessment abilities, companies can identify those candidates that are
    best suited to their vacancies, enabling these companies to consistently select
    and recruit highly suitable employees — thereby saving time, money, and effort,
    enhancing employee job satisfaction and improving employee retention — ultimately
    enhancing overall company performance and profitability.</p><ol><li><p>Prospective
    candidates log into the OUNA platform and complete the Pyramidal Motivations assessment.</p></li><li><p>The
    results are transformed into unique mathematical profiles, and are added to the
    OUNA database. Processing of the profiles is controlled by Smart Contracts.</p></li><li><p>Employers
    log into the OUNA platform and generate THE IDEAL EMPLOYEE PROFILE by evaluating
    the best performing employees with OUNA’s Pyramidal Motivation Assessment.</p></li><li><p>The
    employer runs this PROFILE through OUNA’s database and identifies the candidate
    profiles that best match their requirements.</p></li></ol><h2>FEATURES</h2><p>OUNA’s
    candidate assessment yields a completely anonymous profile, based only on the
    individual’s skills, motivational factors, and values. OUNA is therefore able
    to be fully committed to the principle of equal opportunity employment. OUNA can
    and will help the struggle against discrimination against a job applicant or an
    employee because of the person’s race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
    age, or disability.</p><h2>ALGORITHM</h2><p>OUNA ecosystem will continue to expand
    as more candidates are added to the OUNA candidate database — and more HR recruiters
    discover the power and advantages of working with OUNA.</p><h2><strong>DATABASE</strong></h2><p>OUNA’s
    candidate database currently includes thousands of profiles, containing comprehensive,
    trustworthy, blockchain-based records of their strengths, motivating factors,
    and ideal work environments.</p><p><strong>To learn more about our project, please

  :title: Connection Is a Core Human Need, But We Are Terrible at It
  :content: '<p>No person is an island, and we need healthy relationships to thrive</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6256/1*FwqiiczoOlOmmqyvhqoH0Q.jpeg" alt="Illustration:
    Hélène Desplechin/Getty Images"><em>Illustration: Hélène Desplechin/Getty Images</em></p><p>In
    his book *Lost Connections, *Johann Hari talks about his decades of work in the
    fields of trauma and mental health and why he believes that the root of almost
    everything we suffer through is a severed connection we never figured out how
    to repair.</p><p>At one point, Hari talks about an obesity clinic where patients
    who were overweight to the point of medical crisis were put on a supervised liquid
    diet in an effort to try to save their lives. The treatment worked, and many of
    the patients walked out of the clinic hundreds of pounds lighter and with a new
    lease on life—at first. What happened later was a side effect no doctor predicted.
    Some of the patients gained back all the weight and then some. Others endured
    psychotic breaks and one died by suicide.</p><p>After looking into why many of
    these patients had such adverse emotional reactions, the doctors discovered something
    important: The time when each patient began overeating usually correlated with
    a traumatic event they had no other coping mechanism for. Hari summed up the findings
    like this: “What we thought was the problem was very often a symptom of a problem
    that nobody knew anything about.”</p><blockquote><h1>Connection is the experience
    of oneness. It’s having shared experiences, relatable feelings, or similar ideas.</h1></blockquote><p>Of
    course, the implication is not that every single overweight person is suffering
    some kind of subconscious trauma. The point is that many of the ongoing problems
    we cannot resolve are, in fact, symptoms of deeper problems we may not be aware
    of. In fact, Hari analogizes this to the smoke of a burning house: You can keep
    waving away the clouds, but without putting out the fire, your efforts will be
    futile.</p><p>The biggest problem in most people’s lives is trauma, and trauma
    is what creates a damaged ability to connect with others. “Trauma” is not a term
    reserved for the most severe and unrelenting atrocities one can experience. Anytime
    something scares us and we do not get over that fear, trauma is created. When
    we don’t believe we have the resources or abilities to cope with a certain problem
    or stimuli, we create adaptive behaviors to deny or avoid it.</p><p>It’s not the
    trauma itself that causes the most long-term damage; it is how the trauma wreaks
    havoc on the psyche and prevents reintegration into a normal, healthy life where
    other people and unknown situations are seen as benevolent.</p><p>You’ve probably
    heard this before in different ways: The <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/09/drug-addiction_n_7765472.html">opposite
    of addiction</a>, is not sobriety, it’s connection. The foremost <a href="https://www.learning-mind.com/sense-of-belonging-happy/">pillar
    of happiness</a> is a sense of belonging and purpose. Cultures that are <a href="https://healthypsych.com/individualist-or-collectivist-how-culture-influences-behavior/">more
    communal</a> are more mentally healthy as a whole. People who are alone often
    <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/loneliness-living-alone-may-lead-to-a-shorter-lifespan/">die
    earlier</a> and get sicker before they do.</p><p>We are a tribal species. There
    is no way around this despite what many highly individualistic cultures may want
    us to believe. No person is an island unto themselves. We are born through connection,
    and it is through connection to others that we accomplish virtually everything
    else in life. We do not just prefer healthy relationships; we need them.</p><p>Connection
    is so important, but it is so often overlooked and there are few resources available
    to teach people how to foster real connection in their lives. But there are a
    few essential ideas that can help.</p><h2>Understand What Connection Is</h2><p>Connection
    is the experience of oneness. It’s having shared experiences, relatable feelings,
    or similar ideas. It is the feeling of belonging to something greater than oneself.</p><p>When
    you’re watching a sporting event with your friends, you’re experiencing connection.
    When you gather with your family for dinner or open up and express your authentic
    feelings to another person or find you have something in common with someone,
    you’re experiencing connection.</p><p>We’ve developed a world designed to create
    more connection than ever before, yet somehow, much of the digital age has severed
    connection or fostered inauthentic connection—which does not work. You cannot
    feign oneness. It is not something you intellectualize. It’s something you feel.</p><h2>Learn
    How to Connect With Others Authentically</h2><p>Authenticity is required for connection.
    The internet and social media do not disconnect us because we are glued to our
    phones at the dinner table but because they increase our ability to be inauthentic.
    They allow us to gloat, edit, filter, and post a highlight reel. We can construct
    a façade of our lives that may or may not be an honest reflection of reality.</p><p>In
    this, we breech connection.</p><p>People who have authentic* *connections over
    social media report having a largely positive view and experience of it. People
    who use it as a genuine way to stay in touch with others don’t report the same
    levels of anxiety and depression associated with its use. The reason people try
    to fake their way into being liked is that they confuse attention for connection—and
    they are not the same thing.</p><h2>Focus on Giving Connection, Not Receiving
    It</h2><p>In order to connect with others, we have to give them our time and honest
    feelings and ideas and have shared experiences and openness. We do not connect
    with others by trying to earn approval, awe, compliments, appreciation, envy,
    or superiority.</p><blockquote><h1>In the process of restoring a connection with
    others, we can realize that we actually create a connection with ourselves.</h1></blockquote><p>Most
    people believe a connection is something they earn by being “good enough” when
    it is really something they develop by being willing enough.</p><p>If healing
    is a return to wholeness, then healing from trauma is remembering that we can
    trust others, we can trust ourselves, and we can trust life. It is the reintegration
    into easiness, calmness, and the willingness to allow life to be as it is rather
    than trying to control how it’s perceived. It is not waiting for others to initiate
    or sustain that connection. It is our own willingness to try again, be vulnerable
    again, show up for others, reach out, and make ourselves an active part of our
    communities and families and friend groups.</p><p>In the process of restoring
    a connection with others, we can realize that we actually create a connection
    with ourselves. In being seen and loved for who we are, how we think, and what
    we feel, we learn it’s okay to be as we are.</p><p>If our core human need is to
    connect with others, then the most important part of healing our emotional wounds
    is allowing ourselves to open up again. It is simply our willingness to show up
    as we are, and our trust that we will be taken care of. It is our discernment
    to give our time and energy to those who respect and cherish it back. And, most
    importantly, it is the knowledge that even if we do have to go through the fires
    of life—as all of us do—we come out the other end stronger, clearer, and more
    ready to appreciate what we have.</p><p>Not unlike the Japanese art of <a href="https://www.lifegate.com/people/lifestyle/kintsugi">kintsugi</a>,
    where broken items are repaired and displayed with pride, our connections and
    reconnections are often strongest where we had to forge them ourselves.</p>'

  :title: 5 Essential Investments Every Human Being Should Make In Themselves
  :content: '<p><em>Small things have big consequences. Over time, those consequences
    compound. We are the accumulated momentum of all our choices. Some of those choices
    are binary. Go to the gym or not: that choice in that moment is going to change
    your day. Over time that choice will change your life. We tend to ignore the importance
    of fractional benefit because we lose sight of the concept of the tipping point-
    the little benefit that tips the cup releases a flood of many benefits. It may
    be a 2 percent difference in force or momentum that flips the coin from heads
    to tails, or yes to no. — <a href="undefined">Aubrey Marcus</a></em></p><p>There’s
    no area of your life that’s separate from the others. Your health will impact
    your work. Your work will impact your relationships. Your relationships will impact
    your happiness. Your happiness will impact your performance. It’s an interconnected
    system. And if one of the systems is out whack, the others are inevitably impacted
    by it. The investment with highest ROI is the one you make in yourself, and the
    way you get that ROI is by making the following five essential investments.</p><h2><strong>1.
    PHYSICAL HEALTH</strong></h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/0*SLQojwVVfFy29lo7."
    alt=""></p><p>At the beginning of this year, I had the misfortune of getting the
    flu. And if you were one of the unfortunate people who experienced this, you know
    it was one of the worst years ever. I was incapacitated for almost the entire
    month of January and was spending entire days in bed. My productivity plummeted.
    I had to cancel interviews for The Unmistakable Creative and didn’t get very much
    writing done. It made me realize just how much we take our health for granted.
    Your health is the engine for the rest of your life. If your health is out whack,
    nothing else really works. Investing in your health produces an ROI in every other
    area of your life. That’s why I placed it first on the list.</p><p>How exactly
    do you invest in your health? It’s not as complicated as it might sound. It comes
    down to three basic pillars: sleep, diet, and exercise.</p><h3><strong>Sleep</strong></h3><p>The
    impact of sleep became apparent to me at the beginning of 2015, when I was at
    a major low point in my life. Sleep deprivation is one of the biggest aggravators
    of depression. And I was stuck in a vicious cycle. I was depressed because I couldn’t
    sleep and I couldn’t sleep because I was depressed. I knew that I had not only
    change the way I slept but make it a priority. Thanks <a href="undefined">Arianna
    Huffington</a>’s book <em>The Sleep Revolution</em> I made some changes that led
    to big improvements.</p><ul><li><p><strong>A Casper Mattress:</strong> I was fortunate
    enough to get a <a href="undefined">Casper</a> mattress because the company sponsored
    multiple episodes of the Unmistakable Creative. After a couple of months of sleeping
    on it, I started noticing a difference anytime I didn’t sleep in my bed. Whether
    it was a hotel, a friend’s place or a night at my parent’s house where I have
    a bedroom, the quality of my sleep was always much better when I slept on the
    Casper. <strong><em>A good mattress is probably the most worthwhile investment
    you can make in the quality of your sleep.</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>A
    reduction of Screen Time:</strong> Sometime last year, I found myself going on
    lots of dates with people I met on dating apps. During that time a lot of my good
    habits went to hell. I’d be checking to see if someone responded to my messages,
    sometimes while I was in bed. This didn’t do much for my sleep. Study after study
    has shown that one of the things that’s most disruptive to our sleep is the blue
    light emitted from smartphones, laptops, and tablets. And still, people are scrolling
    through Instagram, swiping right, and checking Facebook, often until right before
    they fall asleep. When I don’t check my phone 2 hours before bed, I always wake
    up the next day with a much better focus. When I do check my phone, the mornings
    are less productive.</p></li><li><p><strong>Soft Sheets:</strong> If you’ve ever
    slept in a hotel bed, you know that it kind of makes you feel like a king. I wanted
    to replicate that experience in my bedroom. When I did a google search, I stumbled
    upon this article by the team at Apartment Therapy. Shortly after, I upgraded
    to 1000-thread count sheets. And I immediately noticed a difference in how I felt.</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>Bonus:

    sponsor of ours makes amazing sheets, so amazing that former US Presidents use
    them.</em></strong></p><p>As my friend Mike says, “sleep is the magic elixir.”
    If you improve the quality of your sleep, you’ll improve every other area of your
    life.</p><h3><strong>Diet</strong></h3><p>If your body is an engine, your diet
    is the fuel that makes it run. In his program How to Stay Motivated, Zig Ziglar
    asks a thought-provoking question.</p><blockquote><h1><em>“If you did have a million-dollar
    racehorse, would you let him stay up half the night drinking coffee and booze,
    smoking cigarettes and eating junk food?” Next question: “Would you treat a 10-dollar
    dog or a 5-dollar cat that way? What about a billion-dollar body?”</em></h1></blockquote><p>I’d
    love to tell you that I’m a total health nut. But, I slip up on occasion. I love
    desserts more than you can imagine and have “experimented” with a handful of substances
    that probably aren’t the best thing in the world for me.</p><p>But as I’ve gotten
    older, I’ve started to value the way my body feels more and more. I rarely drink
    to the point of feeling hungover the next day. I don’t eat pastries for breakfast.
    I don’t think it’s a coincidence that I’ve had some of my most significant professional
    accomplishments as I’ve gotten older. As I said in my upcoming book, if you put
    garbage into your body, it’s likely what you’ll produce regarding creative output.</p><p>So
    what exactly does it look like to invest in your diet? There are a couple of simple
    things that you can do.</p><ul><li><p>*<em>Consider using a meal planning service:
    *</em>While meal planning services can sometimes seem costly, the energy you get
    back from eating well can be a solid enough ROI to justify the cost. And if you
    take that same energy and apply to building your company, writing your book, or
    working on a meaningful goal, it goes from being an expense to being an investment.</p></li><li><p>*<em>A
    Good Doctor: *</em>A few months ago I kept stumbling on these ads for <a href="undefined">Forward</a>,
    the doctor’s office of the future. It’s a bit like the Apple Store for Doctor’s
    offices. Every time I saw the ad, I drooled. Unlike a traditional doctor’s office,
    these guys take a data-driven approach to health. Watch the video below, and you
    might find yourself salivating for them to bring it to your city.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Have
    a Healthy food Environment: *</em>I’ve talked before about the 9 environments
    that make up your life. One of the easiest ways to eat healthy is to have an environment
    that is conducive to the person you want to become. One of my weaknesses is chocolate
    lava cakes from Trader Joes and for that matter anything that involves chocolate.
    As one of my dear friends from college once said to me “you shouldn’t trust people
    who don’t like chocolate. That’s weird.” The one pattern I’ve noticed is that
    if I don’t buy it at the grocery store, I don’t worry about eating it. If I do
    buy it at the grocery store, I’ll eat it every night. Simply put, if you want
    to avoid it, leave it out your environment.</p></li></ul><p>I’m no expert on food
    and diet, but I recommend checking out the work of people like <a href="undefined">Darya
    Rose, Ph.D</a> e, Joe Cross, and <a href="undefined">Aubrey Marcus</a> When it
    comes to diet, there’s no one size fits all solution.</p><h3><strong>Exercise</strong></h3><p>My
    dad is almost 70, but you’d never know it to look at him. When I was in college,
    a bouncer at a bar carded him, and we’ve occasionally been mistaken for brothers.
    (see picture below). There are two things that I attribute to his vitality. The
    first is that he has the patience and mindset of a Zen Buddhist. I have no idea
    how, but it never ceases to amaze me. The second is that he is physically active.
    He parks as far as he possibly can from his office at the UC-Riverside campus
    and walks. He walks every evening. And because he’s the unofficial brand ambassador
    for Costco, he even does his evening walks there. As he jokingly says when people
    come over “everything in this house except my wife is from Costco.”</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/8064/1*pAn4p_hDr1B6sEbQFHu-Yw.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>Over
    the course of my life, I’ve become much more physically active. When I started
    surfing ten years ago, I started noticing an immediate improvement in a bunch
    of other areas of my life. Because I wanted to get up and surf early in the morning,
    I’d go home from a bar at 10 pm. I stopped smoking when I drank. And the water
    became my source for inspiration and coming up with ideas for things to write
    about. The keystone habit of surfing created a ripple effect improving every other
    area of my life.</p><p>So how do you invest in exercise?</p><p>*<em>Hire a Trainer/Join
    a Gym: *</em>One of the most common ways to invest in your physical health is
    to hire a trainer. World class athletes don’t get that way by attempting to do
    everything on their own. They work with coaches and trainers.</p><ul><li><p>My
    good friend <a href="undefined">Joseph Logan</a> is almost 50 and hardly looks
    like it. He works with a trainer.</p></li><li><p>When my business partner Brian
    wanted to bulk up, he hired a trainer. You can see the before and after picture
    below.</p></li></ul><p>I asked personal trainers on Facebook about the non-health
    related benefits their clients had received, and these were just a few of the
    responses that came back.</p><ul><li><p>Confidence and courage to divorce her
    husband who was verbally abusive to her.</p></li><li><p>Being able to go off their
    pills for depression (with doctors approval OF COURSE) my training style focuses
    on building self-confidence and empowerment. It’s SO much more than lifting weights
    or losing weight.</p></li><li><p>Mental strength — once people realize they can
    be physically strong, they start going after other life goals as well!</p></li></ul><p>It’s
    the ripple effect of a keystone habit at work. When you invest in your physical
    health, you look better, feel better, and accomplish more in virtually every other
    area of your life. A physical transformation can help you to ultimately become
    the best version of yourself.</p><p><strong>If you hate exercise…</strong></p><p><strong>Develop
    an athletic hobby</strong></p><p>To be completely honest, I hated exercising when
    I was in my early 20’s. I couldn’t stand going to the gym. I saw it as a necessary
    evil. But when I started surfing and snowboarding that completed changed. Exercise
    is simply one of the fringe benefits of these activities because I enjoy them
    so much. If you manage to find a hobby that’s athletic and fall in love with it,
    exercise will go from something you dread to something you look forward to.</p><p>As
    I’ve said before when you’re stuck mentally move physically.</p><h2><strong>2.
    MENTAL HEALTH</strong></h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/0*WPXuZd6JO9x2NWQK."
    alt=""></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/your-state-of-mind-is-one-of-your-most-priceless-assets-1a9659cf1f8a">Your
    state of mind is one of your most priceless assets</a>, and if you want to optimize
    your state of mind, you have to invest in your mental health. No matter what you
    want to accomplish, whether it’s finishing your education, a relationship with
    the opposite sex, or starting a business, the pillar on which it is all built
    is your ability to manage your psychology. Without this one skill, you will always
    be at a disadvantage.</p><p>People often think that as you get more successful,
    this is less necessary. But one of the most telling things <a href="undefined">Sam
    Altman</a> said about the process of building a startup is that it gets worse,
    the more successful you become. The highs get higher, and lows get lower. A world
    in which you have no problems is a delusional reality. And if it weren’t for the
    issues, you’d stop learning and growing. Problems are ultimately just a pain in
    the ass form of education.</p><p>So how do you invest in your mental health?</p><ul><li><p>*<em>Therapy:
    *</em>In my four years at Berkeley, I only ever went to see a therapist once because
    I bought into this ridiculous narrative that therapy was only for crazy people.
    One of the major themes of my piece on what we should have learned in school but
    never did was managing your psychology. When I found myself in a therapist office
    after a break up at the age of 36, I had one thought. “What the hell took me so
    long to get in here? I wish I’d done this years ago.” Therapy is one of the most
    worthwhile investments you can make in your mental health.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Meditation:
    *</em>Meditation is one of the most low-cost, high return investments you can
    make in your mental health. In as little as two minutes a day, you can reduce
    anxiety, increase happiness, and improve your ability to focus. And if that doesn’t
    convince you of its virtues, I was told by an Unmistakable Creative guest, that
    many billionaires credit their ability not to get rattled by market fluctuations
    to their meditation habit.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Medication: *</em>In our new age
    self-help world dictated by life coaches and internet celebrities, medication
    for mental health gets a bad rap. And it’s often got that wrap from people who
    have no direct experience dealing with depression. Personally, I’ve found it to
    make a huge difference in my life. That being said, I would consider it a last
    resort, something you do when nothing else is working.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Happiness
    is a Habit</strong></p><p>And habits require practice. You’re not going to write
    down a gratitude list once, and feel better over the long haul. You’re not going
    to exercise once and feel energized. This is why it’s worth considering things
    like <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/the-daily-routine-backed-by-science-that-will-make-you-a-happier-person-3f21810da130">this
    daily routine backed by science that will make you a happier person.</a></p><p><em>As
    part of my upcoming book launch, we’re putting together a series of free e-books.
    The first one is the Unmistakable Creative guide to health and happiness which
    you can <a href="https://unmistakablecreative.com/happiness">download here.</a></em></p><h2><strong>3.
    EDUCATION</strong></h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/0*KgzDnLkYiaiVyYFF."
    alt=""></p><p><em>The iPhone is a traveling university. It’s not cheap-but it’s
    way cheaper than an MBA. There are no tests at the end of the year, and you can
    pick your classes — Aubrey Marcus.</em></p><p>As a society, we tend to confuse
    learning with education. Education is a finite game. You complete a course of
    study, get a diploma, and get passed on to the next one. Learning, on the other
    hand, is an infinite game. It continues long after you finish your formal education.</p><ul><li><p>I’ve
    learned more from reading books than I ever did from my college degree.</p></li><li><p>I’ve
    learned more from building a business than I ever did from getting an MBA.</p></li></ul><p>By
    investing the right amount of time and resources, you can <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/give-yourself-an-informal-education-that-kicks-the-crap-out-of-your-formal-one-fa886abd8c59">give
    yourself an informal education that kicks the crap out of your formal one</a>.
    With the pace at which the world is changing, the ability to learn is going to
    be essential to our survival in the future.</p><h3><strong>Books</strong></h3><p>Books
    are wonderful in that they are low cost and produce an incredibly high ROI. You
    can buy them dirt cheap on Amazon, or check them out for free from your local
    library. So how exactly do you read more?</p><p>A couple of years ago a mentor
    of mine recommended that I read the 48 Laws of Power. If you’ve ever read any
    of Robert Greene’s books, you know they’re long, well researched and extremely
    detailed. They’re not the kind of books you can sit down and read in the afternoon.
    If I wanted to finish the book, I had to develop a system.</p><p>If I read two
    laws every day, I’d be done with the book in 24 days. After finishing the book,
    I applied a similar system to all other books I read, which has enabled me to
    read 100 books a year. Like any goal, the easiest way to read a book is to break
    it up into the smallest manageable parts. Even if you only read ten pages a day,
    if you do it consistently, you’ll easily develop a reading habit. This is my recommend
    prescription</p><p>1) Start by reading ten pages a day for a week</p><p>2) The
    next week read 20 pages a day</p><p>Eventually, you’ll find that you want to keep
    reading.</p><p><strong>Courses</strong></p><p>When it comes to online courses,
    what you put into them is what you’ll get out of them. If you’re a person who
    completes all the modules, does all the assignments, and takes advantage of access
    to the instructor you’ll get a substantial ROI on your course. The testimonials
    you see on Ramit Sethi’s sales pages are not from people who bought the course
    and didn’t do shit. They’re from people who followed through and took action.If
    you buy a course, and don’t do any of the assignments or go through the material,
    that’s not much different than flushing your money down the toilet.</p><p><strong>Podcasts</strong></p><p>These
    days there’s a podcast for just about everything you want to learn. Whether you
    want to learn a language, build a business, or just get inspired, there’s likely
    a podcast that will help. What I’ve learned from more than 700 people on the Unmistakable
    Creative has far outweighed the value of both my degrees. These are just a few
    of the things I’ve learned.</p><ul><li><p>I got an <a href="https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/the-neuroscience-of-goals-with-srini-pillay/">in-depth
    class from a Harvard Neuroscientist in how to accomplish personal and professional
    goals</a>.</p></li><li><p>I’ve learned <a href="https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/best-of-confessions-of-a-bank-robber-with-joe-loya/">how
    to change my story from a bank robber</a>.</p></li><li><p>I’ve learned how to
    <a href="https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/garrett-gunderson-moving-from-scarcity-to-abundance/">shift
    my mindset from scarcity to abundance</a> because of Garrett Gunderson.</p></li><li><p>I’ve
    learned about <a href="https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/nick-notas-foundation-meaningful-connections/">the
    foundations of a meaningful connection</a> from <a href="undefined">Nick Notas</a></p></li><li><p>I’ve
    learned <a href="https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/terri-cole-discovering-your-blueprint-to-love-and-boundaries/">how
    to create a blueprint for love and boundaries</a> from Terri Cole.</p></li></ul><p>And
    the list goes on and on.</p><h2><strong>4. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT</strong></h2><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/0*RBCsMhG0vDLjkJvR." alt=""></p><p><em>We
    can spend thousands of hours practicing until we master a skill or we can convince
    a world-class practitioner to guide our practice and cut the time to master significantly
    — <a href="undefined">Shane Snow</a></em></p><p>When I look back at the early
    part of my career and the many jobs I’ve been fired from, there’s one thing I
    wish I’d done. And that was invested in my professional development. If you’re
    serious about having a thriving career, you have to invest in your professional
    development.</p><p><strong>Coaches and Mentors</strong></p><p>In his recent TED
    Talk, the prominent surgeon and author Atul Gawande talked about hiring a coach.
    After years of practicing medicine, one thing became apparent to him. There was
    a point at which people stopped getting better at what they do. So he hired one
    of his old medical school professors to coach him during surgery. Despite how
    long he has been practicing medicine, his professor found room for improvement.</p><p>If
    you’ve watched the TV show Billions, you know that Bobby Axelrod has a performance
    psychologist on staff at his hedge fund. At first, it seems ludicrous that a hedge
    fund would have this person on staff. But given the amount of money at stake,
    a one percent difference in performance could make a MASSIVE dent in your bottom
    line.</p><p>Personally, I think every organization should have a peak performance
    coach/psychologist on their staff. Just because someone is a good manager, it
    doesn’t necessarily mean they are a good coach. This is why people like Michael
    Gervais and Todd Herman are so in demand.</p><p>If you want to become great at
    something, and you want to accelerate your progress, hire a coach. I’ve written
    before about the lifelong ROI of coaches and mentors.</p><ul><li><p>When my business
    partner Brian hired Jeremy miner as his sales coach, he managed to get more than
    a 25x return on his investment and develop skills that he’ll utilize for the rest
    of his life.</p></li><li><p>Recently, I had the good fortune of attending Pete
    Vargas’ Stage Execution workshop, which was all about how to build a system for
    getting more speaking gigs. It was one of the most expensive investments I’ve
    ever made in my career. But, it turned out that what almost every testimonial
    said was true. It would have taken me a year to do what I got done in two days.</p></li><li><p>When
    <a href="undefined">Ryan Holiday</a> writes a book (which usually shows up in
    the mail after you’ve finished reading his previous one), he hires an editor outside
    of the publisher. But that editor does far more than edit. He’s effectively a
    coach.</p></li></ul><p>Most people want to find a mentor without necessarily having
    to pay for it. If that’s the case, I recommend you read <a href="https://ryanholiday.net/finding-a-mentor/">this
    piece on finding a mentor</a> by Ryan Holiday. However, it’s worth keeping in
    mind that when you pay for something, you have more skin in the game. When you
    have more skin in the game, you’re going to be much more motivated to get a result
    from your investment.</p><p><strong>Mastermind Groups/Personal Board of Directors</strong></p><p>In
    one of his recent podcasts, Seth Godin referenced a Mastermind group that he and
    Chip Conley were part of while they were in business school. They would meet once
    a week in a room at the Anthropology building on the Stanford Campus. I don’t
    think it’s a coincidence that both Seth and Chip have been incredibly successful
    in their careers.</p><p>Another way you could do this is to form what is known
    as a personal board of directors. This is something I learned about from a Tim
    Ferriss podcast guest. The parameters are quite simple.</p><p>1) Pick a person
    outside your industry who you look up to</p><p>2) Ask if they would be willing
    to meet with you once or twice a year.</p><p><strong>Conferences and Events</strong></p><p>Attending
    conference is rarely about the content of the event. The value of a conference
    is ultimately in the relationships that are formed from it. As a byproduct of
    attending a conference, I’ve managed to get new sponsors for the Unmistakable
    Creative, met amazing podcast guests and more. After having attended some high
    ticket events like Archangel, what I can tell you is that the caliber of the people
    in the room always varies based on the cost of the event. It’s not a coincidence
    that some of the most successful entrepreneurs always seem to be at the same events
    together.</p><p><strong>A Body of Work</strong></p><p>I’ve said before <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/why-a-body-of-work-has-greater-long-term-value-than-a-resume-a9d0a0fa5c4c">a
    body of work is far more valuable than your resume</a> or your GPA. AS <a href="undefined">Chris
    Sacca</a> has famously said “your GPA only matters to people who have no other
    reason to find you interesting. Building a body of work gives people a reason
    to find you interesting and is a low-cost, high ROI investment in your professional
    development. When I was in college, it used to take thousands of dollars and weeks
    to build a website. Today, thanks to companies like <a href="undefined">Squarespace
    Inc.</a> , you can build a beautiful website in minutes for less than $20 a month.</p><h2><strong>5.
    Your Environment</strong></h2><p>Whether it’s the space you live or work in, the
    clothes you wear, and the car you drive, of all the investments you could make,
    the one you make in your environment will have the highest ROI.</p><blockquote><h1>You
    can’t upgrade one environment and not have it change the others. If you change
    one environment, it will create a ripple effect on every other environment.” —
    Jim Bunch</h1></blockquote><p>The four investments mentioned above are ultimately
    investments in your environment. And your physical environment is the low hanging
    fruit, so let’s talk about how you change that.</p><p><strong>Where You Work/Where
    You Live</strong>: The space in which you work and live has a big impact on everything
    from the way you feel to your day to day behavior. If it is chaotic and cluttered,
    you’ll be more prone to distraction. If it doesn’t inspire you, it will drain
    you.</p><p><strong>Your Car:</strong> You don’t have to drive a fancy or expensive
    car. But if you keep your car immaculate, you’ll notice a big difference in how
    you feel. Remember, every environment is connected.</p><p><strong>Your Clothes/Physical
    Appearance</strong>: Changing the way you dress is one of the fastest ways to
    change the way you feel. Think about how you feel when you’ve showered, shaved,
    had a haircut, and put on your best threads. When it comes to clothes, my philosophy
    is quality over quantity. You buy less stuff, it looks better, and it lasts longer.
    And thanks to companies like <a href="http://www.stitchfix.com">Stitchfix</a>
    you basically have the equivalent of a personal stylist available from your iPhone
    every month.</p><h2><strong>INVESTMENTS DISGUISED AS EXPENSES</strong></h2><p>Sometimes
    investments are disguised as expenses. For example, I spent a decent chunk of
    change on some noise canceling headphones. I know that listening to music when
    I’m writing makes a big difference in my ability to focus. Because I get paid
    to write books, my noise cancellation headphones are an investment in my career.</p><p>I
    come up with my best ideas for new content when I’m either surfing or snowboarding.
    Every year I buy a season pass and take multiple snowboarding trips. I also try
    to take an international surf trip at least every other year. Since these are
    my major sources of inspiration, they aren’t expenses as much as they are investments.</p><p>Last
    year, when I visited my friend Mike Harrington in Colombia, I was stuck on the
    opening to my new book. We ended up watching a documentary about Daft Punk, which
    inspired the opening story for the book. Not a bad return on investment for cashing
    in my points on a credit card.</p><blockquote><h1>Because our life is a series
    of interconnected systems, what appears as an expense in one area of your life
    becomes and investment in another.</h1></blockquote><p>When you invest in each
    of these five areas, you feel better, look better, have better relationships and
    accomplish far more, both professionally and personally.</p><h2>Are you struggling
    with managing your time and attention?</h2><p>I’ve put together a list of interviews
    with productivity experts who can teach you how to master your focus. Just <a

    alt="Photo: *Alejandro Cordón/Flickr*"><em>Photo: *Alejandro Cordón/Flickr</em>*</p><p><em>This
    story is part of the <a href="https://humanparts.medium.com/internet-time-machine/home">Internet
    Time Machine</a>, a collection about life online in the 2010s.</em></p><p>About
    a year ago, I found pictures of myself, naked, on the internet.</p><p>I hadn’t
    put them there, I hadn’t consented to have them posted, and I definitely hadn’t
    been prepared for what I read in the comments: Violent and cinematic descriptions
    of rape and abuse juxtaposed against my open mouth and thigh-highs and undone
    bra. My face was clearly and fully visible. I wouldn’t have seen them at all if
    a friend hadn’t tipped me off, the link embedded in a carefully neutral email
    that I appreciated later for its lack of assumption about what I was supposed
    to feel. “You look sexy! Do you know about this?”</p><p>I was 22 in the photos.
    I was posed and smiling for the camera. I’d certainly consented to have them taken
    by a friend, who did my hair and makeup, and perched me on a wooden stool to get
    the best angles. The stool broke at one point and we laughed about it.</p><p>When
    the pictures were taken, I’d already let go of the fantasy of posting them anywhere:
    The anonymity of my AOL chatroom childhood was long gone, replaced by Google image
    search and linked accounts. I shared some of the photos with a few people I trusted.
    I was old enough to comprehend consequences, but not old enough to accept my part
    in avoiding them. Apparently, I’m still not — nor will I ever be — because I refuse
    to accept that I was even remotely at fault for what happened.</p><p>About 20
    NSFW photos of me taken during that shoot were stolen from my computer by a guy
    I knew, a guy I considered a friend, a guy I felt safe around. I found out later
    that he’d put them in a folder on his desktop, alongside numerous other folders
    labeled with the names of numerous other women that he knew. I still don’t know
    what was in those folders. Probably some photos pulled from Facebook, probably
    sometimes more. I called a few of the women and left it up to them what steps
    to take. You can only do so much.</p><p>He posted mine on a site specifically
    for revenge porn and “obtained” (read: stolen) photos, full of drunk girls, sleeping
    girls, girls of questionable age. I’m much more a Gayle Rubin feminist than a
    Catharine MacKinnon one, but the comments written underneath my body made me sick
    to my stomach.</p><p>They were words I might’ve melted to have texted to me or
    mumbled into my hair by a boy I’d chosen with a liberal arts degree and nice hands
    — words like “slut” and “defile” and “slap” and “hard” and “tight.” Context is
    everything. Here those words weren’t mine, weren’t asked for, or enjoyed. They
    weren’t for me.</p><p>After I saw the thread online I felt panicked, then numb,
    then miserable, then afraid. I didn’t know what I was supposed to do. The immediate
    and urgent need seemed to be figuring out who did it, and collecting a confession.
    I was right on the first guess. He wrote me a long and rambling nonapology as
    only a straight white guy can do, full of justification and short on insight.</p><p>I
    had this ridiculous vision of myself in a courtroom, sweating under lights and
    answering questions about whether I’d ever enjoyed rough sex, ever enjoyed being
    watched, ever owned a webcam, ever had an abortion. In the almost-year since this
    happened, revenge porn stories are everywhere, but at the time I felt alone.</p><p>I
    called my friends. I tried being somber, I tried joking, I tried asking for advice.
    I told my mom. I kept waiting to hear the words I thought I might deserve: “You
    flirted with him, didn’t you? Maybe he thought you wanted him to do it. Doesn’t
    your computer have a password?” And, most of all, those awful, useless words we
    hear so often: “Why would you take naked pictures of yourself, anyway?” To the
    credit of everyone I love, I didn’t hear those questions. I heard sympathy and
    support and a clear indication that I was the victim of a crime.</p><p>I went
    to a lawyer who quoted me a retainer that was out of my price range to instigate
    a civil suit, which seemed to be a legal kind of blackmail in which we would try
    to collect money from him (or really, since he didn’t have any, his parents).
    It didn’t feel right. I didn’t want money, I wanted for it not to have happened,
    and nobody could give me that.</p><p>I toyed with the idea of reporting it to
    the police, but at the time the pictures had been stolen I’d been living in a
    different state. I called the police precinct there but they seemed confused and
    skeptical and wanted me to come in. I’d read enough horror stories about <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/how-police-still-fail-rape-victims-97782/">the
    way sexual assault victims are treated</a> to decide that I didn’t want to go
    to the police. Also, I’d have to give them the screenshots.</p><p>Sometimes, when
    I was just about to fall asleep or wake up, I thought about forgiving him. I thought
    about what he wanted when he used my pictures that way, how much he must have
    needed the attention and the admiration of the other messed-up awful assholes
    who lurk on those forums thinking we deserve what we get. I thought about how
    lonely he must have been and how bad he might’ve felt about himself afterward,
    but then I always came back to the comments and I just couldn’t find forgiveness.</p><p>I
    memorized the comments and replayed them while showering, while getting dressed,
    while grocery shopping, while having lunch. I thought that for the rest of my
    life I would remember this as the “before” time. The last time I bought limes
    before I filed the lawsuit. The last time I ate carrot cake before I became The
    Girl Who Was Naked On The Internet.</p><p>A week passed, and then a month passed,
    and then another, and sometimes I felt angry and sometimes I cried but mostly
    I felt stuck. I started to imagine that maybe if I waited, it would just go away.
    That I would just become another one of tens of millions of girls who are naked
    on the internet. Some professionally, some for fun, some for art, some against
    their will, some without their knowledge. In the end I didn’t do anything, and
    eventually, the link became inactive. What was my page is now a blank sea of white.</p><p>Of
    course the pictures aren’t gone. They’re still out there, somewhere, distributed
    innumerably. They could come back at any time. This will never not have happened.</p><p>It’s
    true that in writing this I might be making myself even more vulnerable than he
    made me, that I might be increasing the likelihood of being found someday with
    my 22-year-old legs spread apart. It’s possible that the comments on this piece
    will hurt me further. But I can’t seem to find it in me to regret having the pictures
    taken.</p><p>No, I don’t want or deserve to have identifying information linked
    to them, because I value my personal safety. Yes, I’m publishing this piece anonymously,
    more to protect my family, friends, employers than for any other reason. But I
    refuse to be ashamed of the pictures themselves, of having taken them, or for
    any of my ambivalent and complex desires.</p><p>I will not tell my female friends,
    my little sister, my nieces, or my daughters never to smile for the camera without
    their clothes on. I won’t tell them never to take a selfie. I won’t tell them
    that enjoying your own body and the attention you get for it makes you dirty,
    stupid, slutty, classless, or pathetic. I won’t tell them never to trust the boys
    they like. I won’t tell them that every compliment comes at a price. I won’t tell
    them that it’s possible to police their image online, and that if their photos
    are shared without their consent, it’s their own fault.</p><p>Ten years from now,
    I hope that we’ll talk about that point of view as dismissively as the way we’ve
    begun to talk about abstinence-only sex education and victim-blaming as applied
    to rape. We’ll recognize that online, as in the physical world, the responsibility
    of safety must lie on the person doing the threatening. We’ll stop scolding teenage
    girls for sending pictures to their boyfriends, who disseminate them or use them
    for blackmail years later. We’ll stop using euphemisms like “scandal” and “leak”
    to describe a violation, a crime with a defined victim, an act of violence. We’ll
    place the blame where it belongs.</p><p>Maybe we’ll even recognize that, contrary
    to the fabled belief, our souls aren’t lost or damned when we’re captured on film.
    That for a woman to be seen naked, preserved in time, should never ruin her life
    or end her career or hurt her family. That if she’s of age and wanted to be seen
    that way by those she chose, to shape her image, to show off the parts of her
    body she adores and values, we should do nothing but celebrate it. It’s in the
    comments section where you’ll find the shameful part.</p><p><em>This post originally

    alt=""></p><p>“Good evening ladies and gentlemen, we’re about to begin our descent
    into Sydney. Please fasten your seatbelts and place your trays in the upright
    position. Local time is 8:42pm and a humid 27 degrees. Our flight crew wishes
    you a Happy New Year, and we hope you fly with us again in 2025.”</p><p><em>Screeech</em>.
    You’ve landed. Time to relax those butt cheeks.</p><p>It was only this morning
    you booked this flight, and now you’re on the other side of the planet. <em>Amazing</em>.
    You’re nervous but excited to visit Australia for the first time. One week to
    explore the city and five weeks on a new design project. When that project match
    showed up in your feed you claimed it in two seconds. You’ve already earned 24,000
    $design in the <a href="http://peerism.org/">peerism</a> economy.</p><blockquote><p>Ping.
    “Need a room?”.</p></blockquote><p>You hadn’t booked any accommodation yet. “Yes
    please”, you respond.</p><blockquote><p>“Just out the front, number 420”.</p></blockquote><p>You
    giggle, then follow the augmented directions leading to a sleek driverless hotel
    room. It’s about the size of a mini bus but without the seats, steering wheel
    and engine. A giant transparent panel stretching the length and height of the
    vehicle greets you on approach. The panel opens and you step inside.</p><p>Inside
    is everything you’d expected. On the left, a couch seat that folds into a queen-sized
    bed with the push of a button. To the right, a small kitchenette with electric
    stove, running water, sink, microwave and bar fridge. Behind that is the detachable
    bathroom module with toilet, shower and wash basin.</p><blockquote><p>“Hi there,
    welcome home. Hungry?”</p></blockquote><p>“I could go some pad thai and a beer
    thanks”, you respond.</p><blockquote><p>“That’ll be here in 6 minutes. Want a
    quick tour of the city?”</p></blockquote><p>“Nah early one tonight. Let’s checkout
    Bondi beach tomorrow”, you say.</p><p>Your room begins driving itself towards
    Bondi and a live map displays on one of the side panels. You sit back and relax
    with some Netflix on the other side panel. Exactly 6 minutes later, a drone lands
    on the roof and lowers your order through a compartment in the ceiling. If you
    need to order any package you simply ask the room and a drone arrives; it even
    does laundry!</p><blockquote><p>“Arriving at Bondi Tower 7”.</p></blockquote><p>You
    look up at a lego-like modular skyscraper reaching high above the moonlit clouds.
    Your room docks with an electric skate and is elevated thirty stories up before
    slotting into a window-facing position. One of the side panels opens smoothly
    to reveal a large adjoining living room module.</p><p>Extra modules are optional
    and can be requested ondemand: an extra bed, private gym, spa, snackbar, office
    and more. On various levels of the tower are cafes, restaurants, retail stores,
    entertainment areas, communal kitchens, laundromats, a gym and even a cinema.
    Luxury living at $30 per night.</p><p>You fall asleep as your driverless hotel
    room recharges itself ready to take you on an extensive tour of the city and beaches
    tomorrow. Your six week experience will be personalized to your precise ondemand
    preferences including invites to local communities, events and interest networks.</p><blockquote><p>“Goodnight”.</p></blockquote><p><img

    of Car Manufacturing</h2><p>The image above is a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Q4JRFA8SJno">screenshot</a>
    of the thousands of new, unsold cars sitting at a dock in a town named Sheerness
    in the United Kingdom. This is one of <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-05-16/where-worlds-unsold-cars-go-die">hundreds
    of locations</a> where new cars sit empty and unused. And while auto manufacturers
    typically keep a 60 day supply, US manufacturers hit a record high of over <a
    href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/gm-has-a-huge-supply-of-unsold-cars/ar-AAofFfZ">4
    million unsold vehicles</a> in their inventory in 2016.</p><p>The issue of <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overproduction">overproduction</a> is a common
    crisis in Capitalism where more goods are produced than there are customers to
    consume them. In a free market this should result in prices dropping until the
    excess supply lowers to meet demand. But what typically happens is that manufacturers
    either <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/02/AR2010070203990.html">artificially
    restrict supply</a> or resort to simply <a href="https://fashionunited.com/news/fashion/h-m-accused-of-burning-12-tonnes-of-new-unsold-clothing-per-year/2017101717884">destroying
    the unsold goods</a>.</p><p>Vehicle manufacturing faces a unique challenge with
    oversupply because the production lines are very expensive to initially setup
    and very expensive to stop. When a vehicle production line is down it costs <a
    href="https://www.manufacturing.net/article/2006/03/22000-minute-manufacturing-problem">$22,000–50,000
    per minute</a> in lost revenue and wage costs. So you can bet that if a particular
    car model isn’t selling, they’ll continue to produce until the next year’s model.</p><blockquote><h1>The
    inevitable reality of ondemand self-driving cars poses a huge looming existential
    risk to the entire auto industry.</h1></blockquote><p>With nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/281134/number-of-vehicles-in-use-worldwide/">1.3
    billion vehicles</a> on the planet and more than 94 million new cars rolling off
    the production lines each year, the auto industry looks rather similar to a runaway
    <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer">AI paperclip maximizer</a>;
    consuming vast resources to sell thousands of various car models, which we then
    <a href="http://www.reinventingparking.org/2013/02/cars-are-parked-95-of-time-lets-check.html">park
    idle for 95% of the time</a>.</p><p>However if ondemand driverless vehicles come
    to fruition then your $10 Uber ride suddenly becomes a sub-$1 ride anywhere in
    the city. At that point the appeal of owning a car will diminish for most of the
    population, thus creating a massive oversupply of unwanted human-driven vehicles.</p><p>Given
    the forecasts of <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/04/the-number-of-cars-worldwide-is-set-to-double-by-2040">2
    billion vehicles on the roads by 2040</a>, and considering driverless vehicles
    need only be idle while recharging, we can roughly calculate that <strong>only
    100 million ondemand driverless vehicles will be required to replace all 2 billion
    human-driven vehicles</strong>.</p><p>In other words, when every auto manufacturer
    begins producing the high-demand self-driving cars <strong>it will take just one
    year to reach oversupply</strong>.</p><p>How and to where will auto manufacturers
    pivot to stay alive?</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4000/1*ZhAL4aIrPesLFfxOkb_Swg.png"

    key concept to grasp with driverless cars is that they truly redefine all of our
    assumptions and preconceived notions. Combustion engines are replaced by two small
    electric motors, the dashboard and steering wheel are unnecessary, and safety
    features are redundant when the cars don’t crash.</p><p><strong>Driverless vehicles
    are simply rooms</strong> sitting atop an all-electric drivetrain and rechargeable
    battery pack with a few extra visual, laser or radar sensors.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*aPiXForILincx_vgyGymgQ.png"

    moving parts</a> compared to the 1500 in an average internal combustion engine
    vehicle. As such it’s predicted that by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/14/electric-vehicles-will-soon-be-cheaper-than-regular-cars-because-maintenance-costs-are-lower-says-tony-seba.html">2025
    all new vehicles produced will be 100% electric</a> and cost much less than the
    cheapest combustion engine vehicles sold today.</p><p>This opens endless possibilities
    to re-imagine vehicles as moving rooms able to cater to a <a href="https://automobility.ideo.com/moving-together/personal-storage">vast
    array</a> of human experiences and activities:</p><ul><li><p>the driverless office</p></li><li><p>the

    bedroom</p></li><li><p>the driverless bathroom</p></li><li><p>the driverless cafe</p></li><li><p>the

    need not be used in isolation either. <a href="http://www.next-future-mobility.com/">They</a>
    <a href="https://www.pixmoving.com/">can</a> <a href="https://www.osvehicle.com/">be</a>
    dynamic, modular and interconnected with other driverless rooms via an ondemand
    request. Tap a button or speak a request, and moments later you can have a bathroom
    or gym module drive itself to your location and autonomously connect to the office
    module you’re currently working from.</p><p>When auto manufacturers rapidly meet
    the 100 million vehicle demand for driverless ondemand transport, they will inevitably
    <strong>pivot operations to manufacture driverless modular rooms</strong> that
    cater to specific human experiences. Any auto manufacturer that fails to pivot
    will cease to exist.</p><p><em>Edit [5 days later]: Toyota is pivoting to become

    alt=""></p><h2>Lego Skyscrapers + Decentralized City</h2><p>If we assume the technological
    and economic drivers propel our reality towards driverless modular rooms, then
    we’ll inevitably require these to stack vertically in skyscrapers within cities.
    The forces of inertia will always remain, so we wouldn’t expect people to want
    to be constantly moving.</p><p>Ondemand driverless rooms will definitely offer
    the option of going to sleep in one city and waking up in another, or requesting
    add-on modules while in transit to a destination. But as more people adopt this
    way of moving and living in a city, we’d ideally prefer to reduce the number of
    lanes on roads, reduce the number of parking spaces and reduce the environmental
    footprint.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*xZX2pCzyzF2qwNWPQsXuvA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The best way to achieve this is to route the driverless rooms through
    <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/">tunnels</a> under the city while in transit,
    and to stack the rooms vertically when stationary. While in transit the rooms
    can connect to other modules like train carriages, and while stationary the rooms
    can connect on all sides.</p><p><strong>Immense vertical skyscrapers can autonomously
    lift these driverless rooms</strong> and their passengers hundreds of meters up,
    where they’re slotted into position before the wall panels open to reveal other
    connected room modules.</p><p>The image to the left is a <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/05/19/pod-vending-machine-haseef-rafiei-3d-printed-housing-modular-homes-mini-living-movies/">pod
    vending machine concept</a> by designer Haseef Rafiei which fantastically conveys
    the vision, though in a fairly industrial architectural design. Imagine a similar
    tower with a modern and luxurious design for driverless hotel rooms and apartments.
    Various levels could include restaurants, nightclubs, retail stores and entertainment.</p><blockquote><h1>What’s
    fascinating about this idea is that driverless hotel rooms are truly no different
    to driverless apartment rooms.</h1></blockquote><p>In today’s reality we think
    of hotels as expensive accommodation intended for a few overnight stays. Hotels
    and Airbnb accommodations are able to charge expensive fees due to their fixed
    and high-demand locations within the city.</p><p>By decoupling accommodation and
    the physical location, we decentralize housing and empower the individual to instantly
    switch to alternative locations. If Bondi Tower 7 is charging a $50 overnight
    fee while Bondi Tower 36 is charging a $10 overnight fee, then your room can haggle
    on your behalf and relocate to the cheapest location that remains within your
    preferences.</p><p>In fact these driverless rooms and “parking” towers can leverage
    blockchain <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/technology">technology</a> to
    <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30998361">remove the human landlord</a>
    altogether. Inexpensive, all-electric driverless rooms can roll off the production
    lines at today’s rate of <a href="http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/features/car-culture/two-born-every-minute-inside-nissans-sunderland-factory-car-february-2016/">one
    to two cars per minute</a> and immediately begin housing and transporting humans.</p><p>The
    driverless rooms could own themselves, manage their finances and schedule their
    own maintenance autonomously via smart contracts. Once they’ve paid-off their
    construction costs, they can offer their services at <strong>rental fees just
    enough to cover their low operating costs, but at zero profit</strong>.</p><p>And
    if we scale this vision of the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/future">future</a>
    out further, why not build entire cities from driverless modular rooms? Beginning
    with a flat and solid surface we could instruct these rooms to behave as building
    blocks which self-assemble into skyscrapers, parks, bridges and everything you
    expect to see in a city.</p><p>Decentralized modular cities could adapt to optimize
    for perfect living conditions that maximize the happiness and creativity of all
    inhabitants.</p><h3>If you enjoyed this, you’ll love my post on <a href="https://medium.com/@nathanwaters/driverless-van-homes-comfort-freedom-below-0-living-costs-part-2-75b5ff4a431a">driverless

  :content: '<p>7 steps to stay focused on the user when designing with ML</p><p><em>By
    Josh Lovejoy and Jess Holbrook</em></p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*-OtRjI8AyOMXGUmK0gv69A.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>Machine learning (ML) is the science of helping computers discover
    patterns and relationships in data instead of being manually programmed. It’s
    a powerful tool for creating personalized and dynamic experiences, and it’s already
    driving everything from Netflix recommendations to autonomous cars. But as more
    and more experiences are built with ML, it’s clear that UXers still have a lot
    to learn about how to make users feel in control of the technology, and not the
    other way round.</p><p>As was the case with the mobile revolution, and the web
    before that, ML will cause us to rethink, restructure, displace, and consider
    new possibilities for virtually every experience we build. In the Google UX community,
    we’ve started an effort called “<strong>human-centered machine learning</strong>”
    (HCML) to help focus and guide that conversation. Using this lens, we look across
    products to see how ML can stay grounded in human needs while solving them in
    unique ways only possible through ML. Our team at Google works with UXers across
    the company to bring them up to speed on core ML concepts, understand how to integrate
    ML into the UX utility belt, and ensure ML and AI are built in inclusive ways.</p><p>If
    you’ve just started working with ML, you may be feeling a little overwhelmed by
    the complexity of the space and the sheer breadth of opportunity for innovation.
    Slow down, give yourself time to get acclimated, and don’t panic. You don’t need
    to reinvent yourself in order to be valuable to your team.</p><p>We’ve developed
    seven points to help designers navigate the new terrain of designing ML-driven
    products. Born out of our work with UX and AI teams at Google (and a healthy dose
    of trial and error), these points will help you put the user first, iterate quickly,
    and understand the unique opportunities ML creates.</p><p>Let’s get started.</p><h2>1.
    Don’t expect Machine learning to figure out what problems to solve</h2><p>Machine
    learning and artificial intelligence have a lot of hype around them right now.
    Many companies and product teams are jumping right into product strategies that
    start with ML as a solution and skip over focusing on a meaningful problem to
    solve.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*1amLc8Z6dlYZRCBvA39Vng.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>That’s fine for pure exploration or seeing what a technology can
    do, and often inspires new product thinking. However, if you aren’t aligned with
    a human need, you’re just going to build a very powerful system to address a very
    small — or perhaps nonexistent — problem.</p><p>So our first point is that you
    still need to do all that hard work you’ve always done to find human needs. This
    is all the ethnography, contextual inquiries, interviews, deep hanging out, surveys,
    reading customer support tickets, logs analysis, and getting proximate to people
    to figure out if you’re solving a problem or addressing an unstated need people
    have. Machine learning won’t figure out what problems to solve. We still need
    to define that. As UXers, we already have the tools to guide our teams, regardless
    of the dominant technology paradigm.</p><h2>2. Ask yourself if ML will address
    the problem in a unique way</h2><p>Once you’ve identified the need or needs you
    want to address, you’ll want to assess whether ML can solve these needs in unique
    ways. There are plenty of legitimate problems that <em>don’t</em> require ML solutions.</p><p>A
    challenge at this point in product development is determining which experiences
    require ML, which are meaningfully enhanced by ML, and which do not benefit from
    ML or are even degraded by it. Plenty of products can feel “smart” or “personal”
    without ML. Don’t get pulled into thinking those are only possible with ML.</p><p><img

    “attached” to pop a reminder when you may have forgotten an attachment. Heuristics
    work great here. An ML system would most likely catch more potential mistakes
    but would be far more costly to build.</strong></p><p>We’ve created a set of exercises
    to help teams understand the value of ML to their use cases. These exercises do
    so by digging into the details of what mental models and expectations people might
    bring when interacting with an ML system as well as what data would be needed
    for that system.</p><p>Here are three example exercises we have teams walk through
    and answer about the use cases they are trying to address with ML:</p><blockquote><h1>Describe
    the way a theoretical human “expert” might perform the task today.</h1><h1>If
    your human expert were to perform this task, how would you respond to them so
    they improved for the next time? Do this for all four phases of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix">confusion
    matrix</a>.</h1><h1>If a human were to perform this task, what assumptions would
    the user want them to make?</h1></blockquote><p>Spending just a few minutes answering
    each of these questions reveals the automatic assumptions people will bring to
    an ML-powered product. They are equally good as prompts for a product team discussion
    or as stimuli in user research. We’ll also touch on these a bit later when we
    get into the process of defining labels and training models.</p><p>After these
    exercises and some additional <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/resources/">sketching
    and storyboarding</a> of specific products and features, we then plot out all
    of the team’s product ideas in a handy 2x2:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*KwrGfG_0ivojLfbPsVMIZQ.png"
    alt="Plot ideas in this 2x2. Have the team vote on which ideas would have the
    biggest user impact and which would be most enhanced by an ML solution."><em>Plot
    ideas in this 2x2. Have the team vote on which ideas would have the biggest user
    impact and which would be most enhanced by an ML solution.</em></p><p>This allows
    us to separate impactful ideas from less impactful ones as well as see which ideas
    depend on ML vs. those that don’t or might only benefit slightly from it. You
    should already be partnering with Engineering in these conversations, but if you
    aren’t, this is a great time to pull them in to weigh-in on the ML realities of
    these ideas. Whatever has the greatest user impact and is uniquely enabled by
    ML (in the top right corner of the above matrix) is what you’ll want to focus
    on first.</p><h2>3. Fake it with personal examples and wizards</h2><p>A big challenge
    with ML systems is prototyping. If the whole value of your product is that it
    uses unique user data to tailor an experience to her, you can’t just prototype
    that up real quick and have it feel anywhere near authentic. Also, if you wait
    to have a fully built ML system in place to test the design, it will likely be
    too late to change it in any meaningful way after testing. However, there are
    two user research approaches that can help: using personal examples from participants
    and Wizard of Oz studies.</p><p>When doing user research with early mockups, have
    participants bring in some of their own data — e.g. personal photos, their own
    contact lists, music or movie recommendations they’ve received — to the sessions.
    Remember, you’ll need to make sure you fully inform participants about how this
    data will be used during testing and when it will be deleted. This can even be
    a kind of fun “homework” for participants before the session (people like to talk
    about their favorite movies after all).</p><p>With these examples, you can then
    simulate right and wrong responses from the system. For example, you can simulate
    the system returning the wrong movie recommendation to the user to see how she
    reacts and what assumptions she makes about why the system returned that result.
    This helps you assess the cost and benefits of these possibilities with much more
    validity than using dummy examples or conceptual descriptions.</p><p>The second
    approach that works quite well for testing not-yet-built ML products is conducting
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Oz_experiment">Wizard of Oz studies</a>.
    All the rage at one time, Wizard of Oz studies fell from prominence as a user
    research method over the past 20 years or so. Well, they’re back.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*doAy8yuUHlLo1JbO37jFNg.gif"

    reminder: Wizard of Oz studies have participants interact with what they believe
    to be an autonomous system, but which is actually being controlled by a human
    (usually a teammate).</p><p>Having a teammate imitate an ML system’s actions like
    chat responses, suggesting people the participant should call, or movies suggestions
    can simulate interacting with an “intelligent” system. These interactions are
    essential to guiding the design because when participants can earnestly engage
    with what they perceive to be an AI, they will naturally tend to form a mental
    model of the system and adjust their behavior according to those models. Observing
    their adaptations and second-order interactions with the system are hugely valuable
    to informing its design.</p><h2>4. Weigh the costs of false positives and false
    negatives</h2><p>Your ML system will make mistakes. It’s important to understand
    what these errors look like and how they might affect the user’s experience of
    the product. In one of the questions in point 2 we mentioned something called
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix">confusion matrix</a>.
    This is a key concept in ML and describes what it looks like when an ML system
    gets it right and gets it wrong.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*-QR9WF1n7jkzn4t1u57NNw.gif"
    alt="*The four states of a confusion matrix and what they likely mean for your
    users.*"><strong>The four states of a confusion matrix and what they likely mean
    for your users.</strong></p><p>While all errors are equal to an ML system, not
    all errors are equal to all people. For example, if we had a “is this a human
    or a troll?” classifier, then accidentally classifying a human as a troll is just
    an error to the system. It has no notion of insulting a user or the cultural context
    surrounding the classifications it is making. It doesn’t understand that people
    using the system may be much more offended being accidentally labeled a troll
    compared to trolls accidentally being labeled as people. But maybe that’s our
    people-centric bias coming out. :)</p><p>In ML terms, you’ll need to make conscious
    trade-offs between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall">precision
    and recall</a> of the system. That is, you need to decide if it is more important
    to include all of the right answers even if it means letting in more wrong ones
    (optimizing for recall), or minimizing the number of wrong answers at the cost
    of leaving out some of the right ones (optimizing for precision). For example,
    if you are searching Google Photos for “playground”, you might see results like
    this:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*JA6ide7VGzj_l4FD."
    alt=""></p><p>These results include a few scenes of children playing, but not
    on a playground. In this case, recall is taking priority over precision. It is
    more important to get all of the playground photos and include a few that are
    similar but not exactly right than it is to only include playground photos and
    potentially exclude the photo you were looking for.</p><h2>5. Plan for co-learning
    and adaptation</h2><p>The most valuable ML systems evolve over time in tandem
    with users’ mental models. When people interact with these systems, they’re influencing
    and adjusting the kinds of outputs they’ll see in the future. Those adjustments
    in turn will change how users interact with the system, which will change the
    models… and so on, in a feedback loop. This can result in “<strong>conspiracy
    theories</strong>” where people form incorrect or incomplete mental models of
    a system and run into problems trying to manipulate the outputs according to these
    imaginary rules. You want to guide users with clear mental models that encourage
    them to give feedback that is mutually beneficial to them and the model.</p><p><img

    example of the virtuous cycle is how Gboard continuously evolves to predict the
    user’s next word. The more someone uses the system’s recommendations, the better
    those recommendations get. Image from [*https://research.googleblog.com/2017/05/the-machine-intelligence-behind-gboard.html](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/05/the-machine-intelligence-behind-gboard.html)">*<em>An

    ML systems are trained on existing data sets, they will adapt with new inputs
    in ways we often can’t predict before they happen. So we need to adapt our user
    research and feedback strategies accordingly. This means planning ahead in the
    product cycle for longitudinal, high-touch, as well as broad-reach research together.
    You’ll need to plan enough time to evaluate the performance of ML systems through
    quantitative measures of accuracy and errors as users and use cases increase,
    as well as sit with people while they use these systems to understand how mental
    models evolve with every success and failure.</p><p>Additionally, as UXers we
    need to think about how we can get in situ feedback from users over the entire
    product lifecycle to improve the ML systems. Designing interaction patterns that
    make giving feedback easy as well as showing the benefits of that feedback quickly,
    will start to differentiate good ML systems from great ones.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2836/1*cD4Zc1XMRTDG6-oUMt7OdA.png"

    including why predictions may be inappropriate.</strong></p><h2>6. Teach your
    algorithm using the right labels</h2><p>As UXers, we’ve grown accustomed to wireframes,
    mockups, prototypes, and redlines being our hallmark deliverables. Well, curveball:
    when it comes to ML-augmented UX, there’s only so much we can specify. That’s
    where “labels” come in.</p><p>Labels are an essential aspect of machine learning.
    There are people whose job is to look at tons of content and label it, answering
    questions like “is there a cat in this photo?” And once enough photos have been
    labeled as “cat” or “not cat”, you’ve got a data set you can use to train a model
    to be able to recognize cats. Or more accurately, to be able to predict with some
    confidence level whether or not there’s a cat in a photo it’s never seen before.
    Simple, right?</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*ZtUs_9crXZqBg9O_Nw-A9A.gif"
    alt="*Can you pass this quiz?*"><strong>Can you pass this quiz?</strong></p><p>The
    challenge comes when you venture into territory where the goal of your model is
    to predict something that might feel subjective to your users, like whether or
    not they’ll find an article interesting or a suggested email reply meaningful.
    But models take a long time to train, and getting a data set fully labeled can
    be prohibitively expensive, not to mention that getting your labels wrong can
    have a huge impact on your product’s viability.</p><p>So here’s how to proceed:
    Start by making reasonable assumptions and discussing those assumptions with a
    diverse array of collaborators. These assumptions should generally take the form
    of “for ________ users in ________ situations, we assume they’ll prefer ________
    and not ________.” Then get these assumptions into the hackiest prototype possible
    as quickly as possible in order to start gathering feedback and iterating.</p><p>Find
    experts who can be the best possible teachers for your machine learner — people
    with domain expertise relevant to whatever predictions you’re trying to make.
    We recommend that you actually hire a handful of them, or as a fallback, transform
    someone on your team into the role. We call these folks “Content Specialists”
    on our team.</p><p>By this point, you’ll have identified which assumptions are
    feeling “<strong>truthier</strong>” than others. But before you go big and start
    investing in large-scale data collection and labeling, you’ll want to perform
    a critical second round of validation using examples that have been curated from
    real user data by Content Specialists. Your users should be testing out a high-fidelity
    prototype and perceive that they’re interacting with a legit AI (per point #3
    above).</p><p>With validation in-hand, have your Content Specialists create a
    broad portfolio of hand-crafted examples of what you want your AI to produce.
    These examples give you a roadmap for data collection, a strong set of labels
    to start training models, and a framework for designing large scale labeling protocols.</p><h2>7.
    Extend your UX family, ML is a creative process</h2><p>Think about the worst micro-management
    “feedback” you’ve ever received as a UXer. Can you picture the person leaning
    over your shoulder and nit-picking your every move? OK, now keep that image in
    your mind… and make absolutely certain that you don’t come across like that to
    your engineers.</p><p>There are so many potential ways to approach any ML challenge,
    so as a UXer, getting too prescriptive too quickly may result in unintentionally
    anchoring — and thereby diminishing the creativity of — your engineering counterparts.
    Trust them to use their intuition and encourage them to experiment, even if they
    might be hesitant to test with users before a full evaluation framework is in
    place.</p><p>Machine learning is a much more creative and expressive engineering
    process than we’re generally accustomed to. Training a model can be slow-going,
    and the tools for visualization aren’t great yet, so engineers end up needing
    to use their imaginations frequently when tuning an algorithm (there’s even a
    methodology called “Active Learning” where they manually “tune” the model after
    every iteration). Your job is to help them make great user-centered choices all
    along the way.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*D4Ykl-wS9nHpFY_ibnioGg.jpeg"
    alt="Work together with Engineering, Product, etc. to piece together the right
    experience."><em>Work together with Engineering, Product, etc. to piece together
    the right experience.</em></p><p>So inspire them with examples — decks, personal
    stories, vision videos, prototypes, clips from user research, the works — of what
    an amazing experience could look and feel like, build up their fluency in user
    research goals and findings, and gently introduce them to our wonderful world
    of UX crits, workshops, and <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/">design
    sprints</a> to help manifest a deeper understanding of your product principles
    and experience goals. The earlier they get comfortable with iteration, the better
    it will be for the robustness of your ML pipeline, and for your ability to effectively
    influence the product.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>These are the seven points we
    emphasize with teams in Google. We hope they are useful to you as you think through
    your own ML-powered product questions. As ML starts to power more and more products
    and experiences, let’s step up to our responsibility to stay human-centered, find
    the unique value for people, and make every experience great.</p><h3>Authors</h3><p>Josh

  :title: Self-Driving Trucks Are Going to Hit Us Like a Human-Driven Truck
  :content: '<p>Self-Driving Trucks Are Going to Hit Us Like a Human-Driven Truck<center></p><h3>The
    imminent need for basic income in recognition of our machine-driven future</center></h3><p>Late
    last year, I took a road trip with my partner from our home in New Orleans, Louisiana
    to Orlando, Florida and as we drove by town after town, we got to talking about
    <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/10829791/Google-very-actively-working-on-self-driving-cars-project.html">the
    potential effects self-driving vehicle technology</a> would have not only on truckers
    themselves, but on all the local economies dependent on trucker salaries. Once
    one starts wondering about this kind of one-two punch to America’s gut, one sees
    the prospects aren’t pretty.</p><p>We are facing the decimation of entire small
    town economies, a disruption the likes of which we haven’t seen since <a href="http://guardianlv.com/2013/08/ghost-towns-and-memories-of-missouris-route-66/">the
    construction of the interstate highway system itself bypassed entire towns</a>.
    If you think this may be a bit of hyperbole… let me back up a bit and start with
    this:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*FAOTYaCoYpUhjiAe3sjofA.png"
    alt="Source: [NPR](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2015/02/05/382664837/map-the-most-common-job-in-every-state?)"><em>Source:
    <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2015/02/05/382664837/map-the-most-common-job-in-every-state?">NPR</a></em></p><p><strong>This
    is a map of the most common job in each US state in 2014.</strong></p><p>It should
    be clear at a glance just how dependent the American economy is on truck drivers.
    According to the American Trucker Association, <a href="http://www.alltrucking.com/faq/truck-drivers-in-the-usa/">there
    are 3.5 million professional truck drivers in the US</a>, and an additional 5.2
    million people employed within the truck-driving industry who don’t drive the
    trucks. That’s 8.7 million trucking-related jobs.</p><p>We can’t stop there though,
    because the incomes received by these 8.2 million people create the jobs of others.
    Those 3.5 million truck drivers driving all over the country stop regularly to
    eat, drink, rest, and sleep. Entire businesses have been built around serving
    their wants and needs. Think restaurants and motels as just two examples. So now
    we’re talking about millions more whose employment depends on the employment of
    truck drivers. But we still can’t even stop there.</p><p>Those working in these
    restaurants and motels along truck-driving routes are also consumers within their
    own local economies. Think about what a server spends her paycheck and tips on
    in her own community, and what a motel maid spends from her earnings into the
    same community. That spending creates other paychecks in turn. So now we’re not
    only talking about millions more who depend on those who depend on truck drivers,
    but we’re also talking about entire small town communities full of people who
    depend on all of the above in more rural areas. With any amount of reduced consumer
    spending, these local economies will shrink.</p><p>One further important detail
    to consider is that truck drivers are well-paid. They provide a middle class income
    of <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Transportation-and-Material-Moving/Heavy-and-tractor-trailer-truck-drivers.htm">about
    $40,000 per year</a>. That’s a higher income than <a href="http://www.whatsmypercent.com/">just
    about half</a> (46%) of all tax filers, including those of married households.
    They are also greatly comprised by those without college educations. Truck driving
    is just about the last job in the country to provide a solid middle class salary
    without requiring a post-secondary degree. Truckers are essentially the last remnant
    of an increasingly impoverished population once gainfully employed in manufacturing
    before those middle income jobs were mostly all shipped overseas.</p><p>If we
    now step back and look at the big national picture, we are potentially looking
    at well over 10 million American workers and their families whose incomes depend
    entirely or at least partially on the incomes of truck drivers, all of whom markedly
    comprise what is left of the American middle class.</p><p>So as long as the outlook
    for US trucking is rosy, we’re fine, right?</p><h3>The Short-Term Job Outlook
    of the American Trucker</h3><p>The trucking industry expects to see <a href="http://www.alltrucking.com/faq/truck-drivers-in-the-usa/">21%
    more truck driving jobs by 2020</a>. They also expect to see an increasing shortfall
    in drivers, with over 100,000 jobs open and unable to find drivers to fill them.
    Higher demand than supply of truckers also points to higher pay, so for at least
    the next five years, the future is looking great for truck drivers. The only thing
    that could put a damper on this would be if the demand for truck drivers were
    to say… drive off a sharp cliff.</p><blockquote><h1><em>That cliff is the self-driving
    truck.</em></h1></blockquote><p>The technology already exists to enable trucks
    to drive themselves. Google shocked the world when it announced its self-driving
    car it had already driven over 100,000 miles without accident. These cars have
    since driven over <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/the-view-from-the-front-seat-of-the-google-self-driving-car-46fc9f3e6088">1.7
    million miles and have only been involved in 11 accidents</a>, all caused by humans
    and not the computers. And this is <em>mostly within</em> metropolitan areas.</p><blockquote><p>“And
    as you might expect, we see more accidents per mile driven on city streets than
    on freeways; we were hit 8 times in many fewer miles of city driving.” — <em>Chris
    Urmson, director of Google’s self-driving car program</em></p></blockquote><p>So
    according to Google’s experience, the greater danger lies within cities and not
    freeways, and driving <em>between</em> cities involves even fewer technological
    barriers than within them. Therefore, it’s probably pretty safe to say driverless
    freeway travel is even closer to our future horizon of driverless transportation.
    How much closer? It has <em>already</em> happened.</p><blockquote><h1><strong><em>On
    May 6, 2015, the first self-driving truck hit the American road in the state of
    Nevada.</em></strong></h1></blockquote><p><center><iframe width="560" height="315"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdSRUG4KTPA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p><p>Self-driving
    trucks are no longer the future. They are the present. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/05/worlds-first-self-driving-semi-truck-hits-road/">They’re
    here</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“AU 010.” License plates are rarely an object of attention,
    but this one’s special — the funky number is the giveaway. That’s why Daimler
    bigwig Wolfgang Bernhard and Nevada governor Brian Sandoval are sharing a stage,
    mugging for the phalanx of cameras, together holding the metal rectangle that
    will, in just a minute, be slapped onto the world’s first officially recognized
    self-driving truck.</p></blockquote><p>According to Daimler, these trucks will
    be in a decade-long testing phase, racking up over a million miles before being
    deemed fit for adoption, but the technology isn’t even anything all that new.
    There’s no laser-radar or LIDAR like in <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/14/5716468/i-took-a-ride-in-a-self-driving-car">Google’s
    self-driving car</a>. It’s just ordinary radar and cameras. The hardware itself
    is already yesterday’s news. They’re just the first ones to throw them into a
    truck and allow truckers to sit back and enjoy the ride, while the truck itself
    does all the driving.</p><p>If the truck needs help, it’ll alert the driver. If
    the driver doesn’t respond, it’ll slowly pull over and wait for further instructions.
    This is nothing fancy. This is not a truck version of KITT from Knight Rider.
    This is just an example of a company and a state government getting out of the
    way of technology and letting it do what it was built to do — <strong>enable us
    to do more with less</strong>. In the case of self-driving trucks, one big improvement
    in particular is fewer accidents.</p><blockquote><p>In 2012 in the US, 330,000
    large trucks were involved in crashes that killed nearly 4,000 people, most of
    them in passenger cars. About 90 percent of those were caused by driver error.</p></blockquote><p><strong>That’s
    like <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/911-death-statistics/">one and a half
    9/11s</a> yearly. Human-driven trucks kill people.</strong></p><p>Robot trucks
    will kill far fewer people, if any, because machines don’t get tired. Machines
    don’t get distracted. Machines don’t look at phones instead of the road. Machines
    don’t drink alcohol or do any kind of drugs or involve any number of things that
    somehow contribute to the total number of accidents every year involving trucks.
    For this same reasoning, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/11/21/would-air-travel-be-safer-without-pilots-steve-jurvetson-thinks-so/">pilots
    too are bound to be removed from airplanes</a>.</p><p><strong>Humans are dangerous
    behind the wheel of anything.</strong></p><p>Robot trucks also don’t need salaries
    — salaries that stand to go up because fewer and fewer people want to be truckers.
    A company can buy a fleet of self-driving trucks and never pay another human salary
    for driving. The only costs will be upkeep of the machinery. No more need for
    health insurance either. Self-driving trucks will also never need to stop to rest,
    for any reason. Routes will take less time to complete.</p><p>All of this means
    the replacement of truckers is inevitable. It is not a matter of “if”, it’s only
    a matter of “when.” So the question then becomes, how long until millions of truckers
    are freshly unemployed and what happens to them and all the rest of us as a result?</p><h3>The
    Long-Term Job Outlook of the American Trucker</h3><p>First, let’s look at the
    potential time horizons for self-driving cars. Tesla intends to release a software
    update <em>next month</em> that will turn on “autopilot” mode, immediately allowing
    all Tesla Model S drivers to be driven between <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/19/8257933/tesla-model-s-autopilot-release-date">“San
    Francisco and Seattle without the driver doing anything”</a>, in Elon Musk’s own
    words. The cars actually already have the technology to even drive from “parking
    lot to parking lot”, but that ability will remain unactivated by software.</p><p>Tesla-driven
    humans won’t be able to legally let their cars do all the driving, but who are
    we kidding? There will be Teslas driving themselves, saving lives in the process,
    and governments will need to catch up to make that driving legal. This process
    is already here in 2015. So when will the process end? When will self-driving
    cars conquer our roads?</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*kg2IBv4Rah6It0-u9_B4mA.png"

    2020</strong> we’re talking more autonomous drive capability. It’s going to be

    all of these estimates together, and we’re looking at a window of massive disruption

    is no turning the wheel in prevention of driving off this cliff either. Capitalism
    itself has the wheel now, and what the market wants, the market gets. Competition
    will make sure of it. Tesla and Google are not the only companies looking to develop
    autonomous vehicles. There are others.</p><p>A company named <strong>Veeo Systems</strong>
    is developing vehicles as small as 2-seaters to as large as 70-seat buses, and
    will be testing them <a href="http://observer.com/2015/03/self-driving-cars-will-be-in-30-u-s-cities-by-the-end-of-next-year/">in
    30 US cities by the end of 2016</a>.</p><blockquote><p>At 25 to 40 percent cheaper,
    the cost to ride the driverless public transit vehicles will be significantly
    less expensive than traditional buses and trains… The vehicles are electric, rechargeable
    and could cost as low as $1 to $3 to run per day.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-14/apple-said-to-be-working-on-electric-car-to-challenge-tesla">**Apple
    is also developing its own self-driving car</a>.**</p><blockquote><p><em>The project
    is code-named Titan and the vehicle design resembles a minivan, the Wall Street
    Journal reported… Apple already has technology that may lend itself to an electric
    car and expertise managing a vast supply chain. The company has long researched
    battery technology for use in its iPhones, iPads and Macs. The mapping system
    it debuted in 2012 can be used for navigation…</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/03/technology/innovationnation/uber-self-driving-cars/index.html">**And
    Uber is developing its own self-driving car</a>.**</p><blockquote><p><em>Uber
    said it will develop “key long-term technologies that advance Uber’s mission of
    bringing safe, reliable transportation to everyone, everywhere,” including driverless
    cars, vehicle safety and mapping services.</em></p></blockquote><p>It’s this last
    one that fully intends to transform the transportation landscape. Uber is going
    all-in on self-driving vehicles to the point it wants to <a href="http://citypaper.net/uberdriver/">entirely
    eliminate car ownership</a> as a 20th century relic.</p><blockquote><p>Travis
    Kalanick, the CEO and founder of Uber, said at a conference last year that he’d
    replace human Uber drivers with a fleet of self-driving cars in a second. “You’re
    not just paying for the car — you’re paying for the other dude in the car,” he
    said. “When there’s no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere
    becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.” That, he said, will “bring the cost below
    the cost of ownership for everybody, and then <strong>car ownership goes away</strong>.”</p></blockquote><p>That’s
    the potential of self-driving cars —<a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-rise-of-automated-cars-will-thousands-of-jobs-and-n-1702689348">**
    the outright extinction of car ownership</a>**. And with that, the elimination
    of entire industries built up around the existence of car ownership like: mechanics,
    car washes, parking, valets, body shops, rental companies, car insurance, car
    loans, and on and on. Even hugely expensive and capital intensive mass-transit
    infrastructure projects like streetcars and light rail can be dropped in favor
    of vastly cheaper on demand robotic “<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-self-driving-cars-could-solve-new-yorks-traffic-woes-2014-6">transportation
    clouds</a>”, and all those construction and maintenance jobs right along with
    it.</p><p>Big players are already in the game. There are huge savings to be found,
    huge profits to be created. Higher quality and safety is assured. Driverless vehicles
    are coming, and they are coming fast.</p><p>But again, what about <strong>trucks</strong>
    specifically?</p><p>Any realistic time horizon for self-driving trucks needs to
    look at horizons for cars and shift those even further towards the present. Trucks
    only need to be self-driven on highways. They do not need warehouse-to-store autonomy
    to be disruptive. City-to-city is sufficient. At the same time, trucks are almost
    entirely corporate driven. There are market forces above and beyond private cars
    operating for trucks. If there are savings to be found in eliminating truckers
    from drivers seats, <em>which there are</em>, these savings will be sought. It’s
    actually really easy to find these savings right now.</p><p>Wirelessly linked
    truck platoons are as simple as having a human driver drive a truck, with multiple
    trucks without drivers following closely behind. This not only saves on gas money
    (<a href="http://www.peloton-tech.com/about/">7% for only two trucks together</a>),
    but can immediately eliminate half of all truckers if for example 2-truck convoys
    became the norm. There’s no real technical obstacles to this option. It’s a very
    simple use of present technology.</p><p>Basically, the only real barrier to the
    immediate adoption of self-driven trucks is purely legal in nature, not technical
    or economic. With self-driving vehicles currently only road legal in a few states,
    many more states need to follow suit unless autonomous vehicles are made legal
    at the national level. And Sergey Brin of Google has estimated this could happen
    <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/10829791/Google-very-actively-working-on-self-driving-cars-project.html">**as
    soon as 2017</a>**. Therefore…</p><blockquote><h1><em>The answer to the big question
    of “When?” for self-driving trucks is that they can essentially hit our economy
    at *</em>any time*<em>.</em></h1></blockquote><h3>The Eve of Massive Social and
    Economic Disruption</h3><p>Main Street USA has already taken a big hit, <a href="https://medium.com/basic-income/how-we-can-transform-americas-broken-economic-system-to-work-for-everyone-ddba38fc328a">and
    increasingly so</a>, over the past few decades. Manufacturing has been shipped
    overseas to areas where labor is far cheaper because costs of living are far cheaper.
    Companies like Walmart have spread everywhere, concentrating a reduced labor force
    into one-stop shopping facilities requiring fewer total workers than what was
    needed with smaller, more numerous, and more widely spread Mom &amp; Pop type
    stores. Companies like Amazon have even further concentrated this even further
    reduced labor force into automated warehouse centers capable of obviating stores
    entirely and shipping directly to consumers.</p><p>All of the above means fewer
    ways of securing employment in fewer places, while commerce has become more geographically
    concentrated and access to money has become increasingly shifted away from the
    bottom and middle of the income spectrum towards the top.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Ecuvog60xd45Uu3m2Yoe5g.png"

    and that money not spent on wages and salaries instead stays in the hands of owners

    on today’s towns similar to the effects the freeways themselves had on towns decades
    ago that had sprung up around bypassed stretches of early highways. When the construction
    of the interstate highway system replaced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_66">Route
    66</a>, things changed as drivers drove right on past these once thriving towns.
    The result was <strong>ghost towns</strong> like <a href="http://www.rd.com/slideshows/ghost-town-pictures/view-all/">Glenrio,
    Texas</a>.</p><blockquote><p>With the patience that carved the Grand Canyon over
    eons, nature reclaims Glenrio, where the clock stopped with the bypass of Route
    66. The replacement of Route 66 with a four-lane superhighway that allowed motorists
    to zip past rather than wander through ultimately allowed Glenrio to decline.</p></blockquote><p>With
    self-driving cars and trucks, here again we face the prospect of town after town
    being zipped past by people (if even present) choosing to instead just sleep in
    their computer-driven vehicles. Except this time, there is no new highway being
    made for businesses to relocate closer to and new towns to emerge along. This

    labor is increasingly unnecessary and even economically unviable compared to machine

  :title: Illustrating a more human brand (part 1)
  :content: "<p>Illustrating a more human brand (part 1)</p><h3>The history of Dropbox
    brand illustration</h3><p>For years before I joined the Dropbox illustration team,
    I assumed the Dropbox illustrators had it easy. I imagined talented people getting
    to make great work for an organization that believed deeply in the power of illustration.
    I mean, what could be chiller than drawing all day? To a casual observer, it’s
    easy to take for granted the pioneering role Dropbox has played in brand illustration.
    But over the last ten years, there have been a handful of times when illustration
    as a Dropbox hallmark has been in jeopardy. It took nearly eight years of speaking
    up in meeting rooms and drafting late night email essays to fight for illustration’s
    power. This is because illustration has long existed at ground zero of Dropbox’s
    identity crisis: are we consumer or enterprise? Do we speak to those audiences
    in different ways? It’s a historic tension that still hovers over our illustrators
    today.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3600/1*dGPuAQHrBS0WkEvbiM5w7Q.jpeg\"
    alt=\"Illustrating a human brand by Brandon Land\"><em>Illustrating a human brand
    by Brandon Land</em></p><p>In December 2016, I received the honor of leading the
    Dropbox illustration team. My first goal has been to understand the decisions
    that were made to cement Dropbox’s artistic legacy. As the illustration team looks
    forward to evolving and pushing the brand forward, I think it’s important that
    we understand the legacy and carry it with us while we advance. In preparation
    for this historical recollection, I had the pleasure of interviewing some of the
    influential creative minds that helped define and prove illustration’s heavyweight
    status. Through these interviews, I found a powerful story about taking giant
    leaps of faith against opposing ideas and data to prove the power of illustration.</p><h2>In
    the beginning, fast and cheap win</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*jTt9TDR5vFF7qfy1.png\"
    alt=\"*First illustration drawn for Dropbox by Jon Ying*\"><strong>First illustration
    drawn for Dropbox by Jon Ying</strong></p><p>Illustration at Dropbox comes from
    very humble beginnings. Jon Ying, who does not consider himself an illustrator,
    drew a piece for a blog post about some bugs they were working on. The image portrayed
    a stick figure chasing after a bug with the intent to smash it to oblivion, and
    it sparked an intensely debated existential question for the company. Who are
    we? Should we be just like all the other respectable companies and play it safe?
    Or should we try something interesting and make a statement? The decision to publish
    the stick figure wasn’t easy, but it was an important decision. Users can be fickle.
    If they didn’t trust that Dropbox was going to take care of their needs, they
    were out. The drawing could actually cost the company. However, Jon believed simple
    universal drawings connected on a human level and inspired empathy when things
    might not be working right. He believed it could even help retain customers through
    some tough times.</p><blockquote><h1>“I made a drawing for an email campaign sent
    to people that recently downgraded from Dropbox Pro. The image we made was a weeping
    PC with a thought bubble with a broken heart inside. People started writing in
    and tweeting to apologize for hurting us by leaving. Many even resubscribed.”
    –Jon Ying</h1></blockquote><p>In the early days of a company, these decisions
    can become hard to untangle, as it’s often two heartfelt, passionate beliefs pitted
    against each other. This decision was hashed out in an absurdly unconventional
    way. It took a long, drawn-out Dance Dance Revolution battle between the two founders.
    It lasted 23 hours straight. No sleeping. No eating. No bathroom breaks. No mercy.
    Ok, not really — it was actually just a meeting, but in that meeting, co-founder
    Arash Ferdowsi passionately fought for Jon Ying’s vision. He believed Jon was
    on to something. After all, in the early days, Jon worked in customer support.
    He was the most connected to the users, and Jon was damn good at connecting with
    an audience at a universally human level.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Sz6UkEw6WAEiWQlr.png\"

    alt=\"Keep your files safe by Jon Ying\"><em>Keep your files safe by Jon Ying</em></p><p>Arash
    and Jon’s passionate vision was met with extreme doubt. There were just no data
    or examples to support that the style would be a good decision. At face value,
    what Jon Ying was asking was pretty nuts. If you can think back to nearly a decade
    ago, no one was using illustration in brands like Dropbox, especially not stick
    figure comics. Drew Houston (CEO and co-founder) had good reason to think it was
    a silly idea. But that’s the thing: it <em>was</em> a silly idea. It didn’t take
    itself too seriously. It wasn’t beholden to corporate trends or best practice
    marketing and sales knowledge. It thumbed its nose at being put in a box.</p><p><img

    alt=\"Illustration by Jon Ying\"><em>Illustration by Jon Ying</em></p><p>What
    the style did have, however, was a well-reasoned argument for why it would work.
    Jon’s solution worked well for the biggest realities Dropbox was facing at the
    time. The product was young, it went down almost daily in 2008, and the team needed
    a quick and easy way to communicate with customers in a way that felt like there
    were humans working on the problems. At the time, Dropbox couldn’t afford an illustrator,
    and there was a need for a lot of communication at the time. Jon explains, “There
    actually wasn’t much inspiration or thought that went into the early day illos.
    They were in many ways driven by necessity, chance, then reflection.” In those
    days, debate about using stick figure drawings often resolved itself through the
    classic engineer’s agreement: try it, and if the data didn’t support it, they
    wouldn’t do it again. Fortunately for us, people really responded to Jon’s work.
    They even went so far as to take time out of their days to email about the drawings.
    It was a hit!</p><blockquote><h1>“Dropbox’s brand thinking at the time was, should
    we try doing the gradienty bullshit every other 2008 tech company is doing? No,
    it’s lame. Should we try hiring a full-time illustrator? No, we’re poor. Should
    we just stick with this style for now? Yeah, Jon seems to draw clever stuff, it
    works with the product experience, and we can keep paying Jon the same money for
    doing two jobs. What a schmuck.” –Jon Ying</h1></blockquote><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2780/1*KC_CBsFfn-5NsTlSqlCnrg.png\"
    alt=\"Psychobox illustration by Jon Ying\"><em>Psychobox illustration by Jon Ying</em></p><p>As
    the need for illustration grew, one of the next challenges was to draw something
    for the 404 page. This would be the first introduction of illustration inside
    the actual product. The only problem was that Jon didn’t have any drawing supplies
    other than plain ol’ pens. Arash decided the two of them would go to the Walgreens
    downstairs and buy some art supplies. They picked out some colored pencils and
    drawing paper, and <em>voilà</em>, the Dropbox aesthetic was born. Jon drew a
    version of the Dropbox logo <em>à</em> <em>la</em> Escher, and it was a big hit
    internally. However, despite internal praise, there was another roadblock for
    Jon to overcome. Creating silly drawings on the blog or in emails is one thing.
    But putting them in the product? That’s crazy talk! Convention was loud and clear
    that this color pencil drawing of insanity was an unprofessional approach. 404
    pages are a moment of frustration, and Jon was making a joke? The challenge had
    to be raised again: “Do we want to be a company that does this kind of crazy stuff?”</p><blockquote><h1>“The
    early days were all about irreverence. It worked for our users, but perhaps more
    importantly, it attracted the type of employees we wanted at the time. An illustration
    of a raptor, eagle, and shark was used on our jobs page. Many of our early hires
    went on to say ‘your jobs page was different from every other one out there, and
    I saw myself being a part of what you were trying to do.’” –Jon Ying</h1></blockquote><p>At
    this point, you probably see a pattern here. A desire to be innovative or different
    will always meet its counter argument to do what is expect and tested. This debate
    will go on in every company throughout time. However, Jon wasn’t disheartened
    by the debate, and he didn’t take his initial wins for granted. He understood
    illustration would be continually on the chopping block, so Jon took every chance
    he could to build meaning and value around the work that he did. “We weren’t simply
    being irreverent for irreverence’s sake,” Jon remembers. “There were other factors
    of familiarity and approachability that we wanted to capture. A kind of a ‘you
    can do it, too’ spirit we wanted the user to feel.”</p><p>As the style progressed,
    one of the main components of meaning for the work was to connect with people
    in a more personal way. Jon started to build a means of conversation within his
    work by using Easter eggs in the product. These little moments of discovery made
    people say, “Oh, that’s clever.” And more importantly, it invited them to think,
    “I’m clever for getting their reference. I relate to the people who work at Dropbox.”
    Jon had started building relationships and friendships with people through his
    art. There were even times when strangers literally walked up to Dropbox employees
    on the street and gave them a hug. That type of relationship was traditionally
    considered impossible to create with a company.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2798/0*cMUIRI3cqxkuN0tI.png\"
    alt=\"Version history by Jon Ying\"><em>Version history by Jon Ying</em></p><p>Jon’s
    philosophy didn’t just stop at an emotional connection. He also built out a philosophy
    for the thinking behind the work. Jon wanted Dropbox’s users to understand the
    imaginative journey one must take to build this type of product, and how hard
    Dropbox employees worked to make it a reality. Dropbox needed users’ trust, and
    that meant sharing a piece of Dropbox’s culture with them. To do that, Jon devised
    a fantasy world where metaphor and pop culture collided to put a fun spin on what
    was ultimately an extremely boring concept — cloud storage. When the need arose
    to communicate about version history, Jon could use a DeLorean from <em>Back to
    the Future</em>. When talking about mobile capabilities, Jon would show characters
    enjoying life with all their files in a kite. He crafted compelling reasons around
    the use of illustration, so illustration would be in a solid position the next
    time it was second-guessed.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/0*U_wxCRpQ4FRptGmL.png\"
    alt=\"Illustration by Jon Ying\"><em>Illustration by Jon Ying</em></p><p>Jon contributed
    many conceptually interesting illustrations, but he is the type of guy who loves
    to take a new thing head on. Soon enough, he became involved in too many parts
    of the company to keep up with the illustration work needed. It was time to hire
    some new talent. In a serendipitous series of events, Dropbox had recently contracted
    <a href=\"http://ryanputn.am/\">Ryan Putnam</a> to build out a design/illustration
    system for their <a href=\"http://rypearts.com/portfolio/dbx/\">big DBX event</a>.
    His work was amazing, and Dropbox decided to bring Putnam on board to help with
    the giant mountain of work. This is the beginning of what has fondly been referred
    to as the “Putnam era.”</p><h2>Systemizing aesthetics and the feedback process</h2><p><img

    conference by Ryan Putnam</em></p><p>Dropbox was growing very quickly. The product
    was a budding success, and the need for talent was massive. If you’ve never been
    part of a small company that’s rapidly growing, let me take a minute to describe
    it to you. It’s insanity. Every task, job, problem, success — it’s all brand-new
    to everyone involved. The entire company is making educated guesses while taking
    on responsibilities they never thought they’d be able to effectively help out
    on. This type of growth is a key component to the revolutionary success of the
    tech industry. People aren’t afraid to make mistakes. They’re encouraged to move
    fast and learn quickly what does and doesn’t work. The tough part managerially
    is that everyone’s opinion on everything is valid. For illustrations, this makes
    for a lot of, “We’ll know it when we see it.” That means every illustration becomes
    a monumental effort of meandering through the darkness. Illustration transforms
    from a delightful part of the brand to a battle zone of opinions. This is the
    chaos that quickly started to manifest around the time Ryan Putnam joined the
    team.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*dTAwvEt0DwTkvJhVcXz7UA.png\"

    a generalist, which was perfect for Dropbox at the time. He designed and illustrated
    for products, marketing needs, blogs, internal comms, etc. The sheer volume and
    variety of the design work needed was pretty staggering. Putnam needed to move
    quickly, so he leaned on an illustration style he was most comfortable with. Putnam’s
    style was warm and approachable. It was a logical evolution for the Dropbox brand,
    but at the same time, designers <a href=\"http://byalicelee.com/\">Alice Lee</a>
    and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/house\">Allison House</a> were also creating
    illustrations in their own styles. There was a moment in time where work was made
    in any style an artist wanted. There was minimal oversight because there was so
    much to be done. If it felt good enough, it made it through. There was a lot of
    talented people creating great work. But as it turns out, that’s not a sustainable
    model for a brand. If anything goes with the illustration, then anything also
    goes with the feedback, and chaos started to take root.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Oyqw1tTwdcX5Vl4d.png\"

    once had a focused point of view, it was starting to jump all over the place.
    It started to seem like an afterthought as opposed to something deeply integrated
    into the company’s DNA. Putnam understood that if an illustration system lacks
    a strong point of view, then everyone and their dog will impose their uninformed
    opinions. This was causing chaos where a single piece of feedback could set projects
    back or even derail them completely.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*juT4WmqwzpGFESR-.png\"

    alt=\"*Illustration brand guidelines by Putnam*\"><strong>Illustration brand guidelines

    to be systemized, or it was going to be replaced. He dedicated his tenure at Dropbox
    to building a guide for how illustration was created and measured. This included
    a specific point of view on how the company gave feedback about illustration.
    It turns out that a lot of meetings go into educating people about brand best
    practices. Like, a gross amount. And on top of those meetings, Putnam and the
    team still had to get their actual design work done. At this point, Putnam started
    walking the same path that Jon Ying had to pave in the beginning. To ensure illustration’s
    place in the brand, they had to work twice as hard.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*O6nAllSNveMb3LWR.png\"

    exploring an aesthetic system that could be scalable as they hired new designers.
    He understood that in order to scale their team, a foundation needed to be created
    for illustrators to work on top of. Dropbox brought in illustrator/designers <a
    href=\"http://zachiszach.tumblr.com/\">Zach Graham</a>, <a href=\"http://justinpervorse.com/\">Justin
    Pervorse</a>, and <a href=\"http://lindaeliasen.com/\">Linda Eliasen</a> to help
    scale the design language. Ultimately, Zach and Putnam dedicated their focus to
    creating an updated brand style that honored Jon Ying’s style while also evolving
    it into a more refined digital style. They created an easy-to-replicate system
    of using objects to tell stories. Often the objects had smiles. Zach jokes, “At
    one point, I think everything had a smile.” People tend to give a nostalgic self-aware
    laugh at the smile period. There was a real mandate for the illustrations to convey
    delight. There was a lot of delight. \U0001F600</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/0*U8XcE8hMP65XpPAS.png\"
    alt=\"Illustrations by Ryan Putnam and Zach Graham\"><em>Illustrations by Ryan
    Putnam and Zach Graham</em></p><p>The emerging system was working. They started
    scaling it out to other products and pressure testing it as a broader language.
    Putnam was able to build a precedent for the work that served as common ground
    for feedback and furthered illustration’s role in the company. This was a major
    win for the company’s ability to understand and communicate ideas through illustration.
    There was one big issue, though. Through the process of systemization, the style
    had lost a key component. It lost its whimsical, conceptual nature. Where Jon
    Ying once strove to never show a folder or file, the style now was primarily object-based.</p><p><img

    and illustrations for Dropbox’s now retired product Carousel.\"><em>Design and
    illustrations for Dropbox’s now retired product Carousel.</em></p><p>The contrast
    between a more objective style and purely conceptual pieces is very interesting.
    In Jon’s days, the product was very conceptual. The user’s stuff was now in the
    cloud. People didn’t even know what “the cloud” was. It was brand-new, and the
    company needed to sell why this was something worth moving toward. It was closer
    to a lifestyle connection. Whereas during the Putnam era, people understood the
    cloud, but they needed to understand the practical uses of Dropbox. This meant
    that mentally connecting one’s environment to Dropbox was helpful in showing its
    usability. But ultimately, one or the other wasn’t good enough for the team. They
    constantly thought about what was working and how to take it to the next level.</p><h2>Proof
    of concept</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/0*F5Fwlz-1nuwb9wi4.png\"
    alt=\"Access denied illustration by Zach Graham\"><em>Access denied illustration
    by Zach Graham</em></p><p>While Dropbox was growing rapidly, new hires were brought
    in from a variety of other successful companies. Leadership got deeper and wider,
    and illustration had a new crop of people to prove itself to. The new illustration
    system was working, but so much changes quickly in startups. They have to zig
    and zag constantly. This meant new hires across the company could only use what
    they had learned from other companies to inform what should happen at Dropbox.
    After all, they were hired for their past successes. The only problem was that
    Dropbox wasn’t like any other company. The people that joined Dropbox wanted to
    work there because it has a certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em>, but they had a hard
    time translating that internal culture to how the brand should sit in the world.
    The company had gone full circle, and illustration was up for another round of
    “survive the chopping block.” Some believed deeply that it was time for Dropbox
    to feel more in line with what other companies were doing. The problem was that
    most companies relied heavily on pictures of boring people just looking at their
    phones in a work scenario. Lame!</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*QQf_VCoySU2NYR7j-HUEUQ.png\"
    alt=\"Fish bowl illustrations by Zach Graham\"><em>Fish bowl illustrations by
    Zach Graham</em></p><p>Illustration had to step up its game. It had to serve as
    an emotional connection that far outweighed what other companies were doing with
    photography. One chance to prove that emotional power arose with the need to create
    a “please don’t downgrade” page. The illustration appeared when users wanted to
    downgrade from a paid plan to the free plan. Dropbox needed something to help
    users understand they get a whole lot of bang for their buck. Zach explains, “I
    wanted to figure out how to make people feel guilty without being an asshole.
    At that time there were smiley faces on everything, and I didn’t want to do that.
    I didn’t want to draw a file crying. It wasn’t going to work.” Zach came up with
    the idea of two differently sized fishbowls. He portrayed the concept of space
    without connecting it to files at all. He wanted you to remember how sad your
    pet would be if they were in a cramped space. You don’t want to be the type of
    person that lives in a cramped space, right? Apparently, people can really relate
    to the emotions of a fish, because it convinced people not to click that final
    “Yes, I’m sure” button. Some say this illustration saved the company millions
    of dollars. Others say, “Whoa, cool, people say it was that much?” Either way,
    I wasn’t able to track down the actual statistic for its success, but its impact
    on the future of illustration was quite significant.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Uzhm6QugUWYAxUQV.jpg\"
    alt=\"*Illustration about building on top of Dropbox by Zach Graham*\"><strong>Illustration
    about building on top of Dropbox by Zach Graham</strong></p><p>While the fishbowl
    pieces served as the sacrificial lamb on the chopping block, the big debate about
    if we should move away from illustration roared on. Illustration had proven itself
    useful in certain battles, but there was still the question of whether it was
    the right tool to win the war. “The sentiment was that the company needed to grow
    up,” Zach recalls. “I agreed with that sentiment. We did need to grow up. But
    illustration can be conceptually sophisticated, and that’s what I was interested
    in.”</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2256/0*pUO-dUeCbl8hsoaO.png\"
    alt=\"*Illustration by Zach Graham*\"><strong>Illustration by Zach Graham</strong></p><p>At
    the time, it was difficult to find the right answer between both sides. Although
    there was a tighter system for understanding illustration, there was no clear
    way for other parts of the org to understand what brand was or how it should be
    approached. There wasn’t a brand team at the time. There was just a pool of designers
    working on pretty much everything. While Zach’s conceptual illustrations were
    still proving their worth on the growth and monetization side, it started to become
    clear that there needed to be a defined process for making brand decisions. The
    contrasting ideas about illustration’s worth were not going to solve themselves.</p><blockquote><h1>“What
    we saw that marketing didn’t see yet was that illustration was starting to become
    really popular in brands, and as it was emerging, people were already ripping
    off what we are doing. It was obvious that we were doing something right. So we
    wanted to push that.” –Zach Graham</h1></blockquote><p>Every pillar of the company
    had specific needs, and there wasn’t a clear path for anyone to work alongside
    brand experts to create meaningful work for those needs. They didn’t understand
    that a brand’s major power was that it could make hard-to-understand concepts
    relatable at a gut level. Without brand, decisions boiled down to the hard numbers
    and research coming from marketing and finance. It’s hard to beat those numbers
    with a mere, “Trust me, this will work.” It’s easy to blame one side or the other
    for the rough patch in the relationship, but really both sides were 100 percent
    right in what they were trying to do. They all wanted what was best for Dropbox.
    The real problem was that there was no organizational structure around how they
    could build a brand correctly. Perhaps even more importantly, there wasn’t anyone
    dedicated to educating people about the long-term powers of the brand as a whole.</p><blockquote><h1>“In-the-moment
    decisions often have a disproportionate impact on the future. Drew could’ve said
    no to psychobox. Ryan Putnam could’ve not drawn the cupcake. We could’ve gone
    with colored geometry over broken line. We could’ve switched 100 percent to photos.
    But maintaining our illustrations’ essence is a deliberate tradeoff we’ve fought
    for, because it’s the closest proxy in our brand for the wonder and joy people
    feel when they accomplish things with Dropbox.” –Jon Ying</h1></blockquote><p>As
    with all good two-part stories, I must end part one with a cliffhanger. Will our
    illustrative do-gooders be able to find a better way of working? Is illustration
    at Dropbox doomed? Tune in next time as I tell the tale of the creation of the
    brand studio, demanding bosses, and a whole lot about the conception of our modern-day
    Dropbox illustration style. There might even be Razor scooter battle on the stage
    of the SF Opera! I guess you’ll have to wait and see…</p><p><em>Update: Still

  :title: Why “Don’t Worry About Money, Just Travel” Is The Worst Advice Of All Time
  :content: '<p>Chelsea Fagan<em><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dbl90/">D.
    Zampiron</a></em></p><p>I have an internet acquaintance that I’ve been following
    on social media for a little over two years now, an all-around nice, smart girl
    who blogs and does odd jobs and has recently decided to go back and get a Master’s.
    In Europe. For a degree that, by all reasonable accounts, is probably not going
    to lead to a great job. And she knows this, I think, because she talks about it
    as “an opportunity to learn and expand her mind,” more than any sort of preparation
    for a future career. Which is fine, but the truth of the matter is that she is
    able to enjoy such freedom — to be a wanderer of sorts who enjoys travel, study
    for the sake of study, and long conversations over good dinners — because she
    comes from a good bit of wealth and, if not subsidized entirely, never has to
    worry about her safety net. She won that particular bit of genetic lottery, and
    it’s useless to begrudge her the freedom that fate bestowed on her.</p><p>But
    it <em>is</em> useful — important, even — to begrudge her the attitude that comes
    with it, one that is all too prevalent amongst young people who do not have to
    worry about the foundations of their future financial security: This idea that
    you *must *travel, as some sort of moral imperative, without worrying about something
    as trivial as “money.” The girl in question posts superficially inspiring quotes
    on her lush photos, about dropping everything and running away, or quitting that
    job you hate to start a new life somewhere new, or soaking up the beauty of the
    world while you are young and untethered enough to do so. It’s aspirational porn,
    which serves the dual purpose of tantalizing the viewer with a life they cannot
    have, while making them feel like some sort of failure for not being able to have
    it.</p><p>It’s a way for the upper classes to pat themselves on the back for being
    able to do something that, quite literally, anyone with money can buy. Traveling
    for the sake of travel is not an achievement, nor is it guaranteed to make anyone
    a more cultured, nuanced person. (Some of the most dreadful, entitled tourists
    are the same people who can afford to visit three new countries each year.) But
    someone who has had the extreme privilege (yes, privilege) of getting out there
    and traveling extensively while young is not any better, wiser, or more worthy
    than the person who has stayed home to work multiple jobs to get the *hope *of
    one day landing a job that the traveler will assume is a given. It is entirely
    a game of money and access, and acting as though “worrying about money” on the
    part of the person with less is some sort of trivial hangup only adds profound
    insult to injury.</p><p>I was able to travel, and even though I paid for my life
    abroad with my own work, it was still a result of a healthy amount of privilege.
    I was from a middle-class family who I did not need to support or help financially,
    I knew that I could always slink back to their couch if things didn’t work out,
    and I had managed to accrue a bit of savings while living at home for the few
    months before I left. There are millions of people who have none of these things,
    and even if they wanted to pay for travel on their own, would simply not be able
    to because of the responsibility or poverty they lived with. For even my modest
    ability to see the world, I am eternally grateful.</p><p>And what’s more, I understand
    (perhaps even better after having traveled a good amount) that nothing about your
    ability or inability to travel means anything about you as a person. Some people
    are simply saddled with more responsibilities and commitments, and less disposable
    income, whether from birth or not. And someone needing to stay at a job they may
    not love because they have a family to take care of, or college to pay for, or
    basic financial independence to achieve, does not mean that they don’t have the
    same desire to learn and grow as someone who travels. They simply do not have
    the same options, and are learning and growing in their own way, in the context
    of the life they have. They are learning what it means to work hard, to delay
    gratification, and to better yourself in slow, small ways. This may not be a backpacking
    trip around Eastern Europe, but it would be hard to argue that it builds any less
    character.</p><p>Encouraging that person to “not worry about money,” or to “drop
    everything and follow their dreams,” demonstrates only a profound misunderstanding
    about what “worrying” actually means. What the condescending traveler means by
    “not worrying” is “not making it a priority, or giving it too much weight in your
    life,” because on some level they imagine you are choosing an extra dollar over
    an all-important Experience. But the “worrying” that is actually going on is the
    knowledge that you have no choice *but *to make money your priority, because if
    you don’t earn it — or decide to spend thousands of it on a trip to Southeast
    Asia to find yourself — you could easily be out on the streets. Implying that
    this is in any way a one-or-the-other choice for millions of Americans is as naive
    as it is degrading.</p><p>Everyone needs to forge their own path to financial
    independence and freedom. And perhaps you are lucky enough that your path involves
    a lot of wandering around, taking your time, and trying a bunch of new things
    — because you know that security will be waiting for you at the end of the rainbow.
    That’s fine, and there is no need to feel guilt or shame over your privilege,
    if only because it’s unproductive and helps no one. But to encourage people to
    follow your very rare path, because you feel it is the only way to spiritual enlightenment
    or meaning, makes you an asshole. It makes you the person who posts vapid “inspirational”
    quotes that only apply to a tiny percent of the population who already has all
    the basics covered. And God forbid anyone who needs the money actually *does *follow
    that terrible advice, they won’t be like you, traipsing around South America and
    trying degrees for fun. They will, after their travels are over, be much worse
    off than when they started. And no souvenir keychain is going to make that reality
    sting any less.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*3wopkvEHHT88TI4LYtvjrQ.png"

    or with family or old mates from Denmark.</p><p>What allowed me to change and
    prosper was the freedom to grow apart and lose touch with people. It’s hard to
    change yourself if you’re stuck in the same social orbit. There’s a gravitational
    force that pulls you into repeating the same circular pattern over and over again.
    Breaking out of that takes tremendous force.</p><p>In real life, this force is
    mercifully thrust upon you at critical moments for self-discovery and evolution.
    You leave university, and you automatically lose touch with most of the people
    you knew there. It’s not an affront to anyone that this happens. It doesn’t take
    any effort. Everyone accepts that it’s a natural process.</p><p>But Facebook changed
    that. It stunted this natural, gentle process of growing apart and losing touch.
    Now the default is to stay connected with everyone you’ve ever friended forever.
    And to break that connection, you have to actively sever it. Something most people
    don’t like doing, and don’t like having done to them, so it generally doesn’t
    happen.</p><p>Knowing that everything you share will be seen by all these people
    from your past quietly. moderates what you actually share. Becoming someone else
    entails experimenting and failing with new styles and ideas. Not a lot of people
    are so keen to premiere such vulnerable stages of their evolution in front of
    an audience that expects them to be that same person they always were forever.
    I know I wasn’t.</p><p>Neither was I interested in constantly living in the past
    with images and sharing from people whom a natural process would have seen me
    lose that touch with. It felt suffocating on both a conscious and unconscious
    level. Connected in the sense that an anchor is to a boat. A literal drag.</p><p>So
    I pressed the red button and nuked all these synthetic connections from Facebook’s
    orbit in one go.</p><p>It was liberating.</p>"

  :title: 'Microsoft CEO Says Data Privacy is a Human Right: The Week in Data Privacy
    and Transparency'
  :content: '<p>In this week’s data privacy news, the CEO of Microsoft urges tech
    companies to focus on data privacy, Mark Zuckerberg announces Facebook’s data
    privacy timeline, Data443 releases an innovative data security product, and more.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*3LqLYiaDccFlpXN00SGIDg.png" alt=""></p><h3><strong>Microsoft
    CEO Satya Nadella speaks out about data privacy</strong></h3><p>In a keynote address
    this past Thursday, Nadella voiced his support for privacy as a “human right.”
    He focused on three major elements: privacy, cybersecurity and AI ethics. He cited
    EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as a model form of legislation.
    This nod follows a similar sentiment from Apple CEO Tim Cook, who championed the
    legislation at a talk this month as well. Nadella urged companies to see common
    citizens and small businesses as the most vulnerable to cyber threats, and tasked
    them with using their power to protect them.</p><p>“We need to use our collective
    prowess and power to protect these most vulnerable of populations, and it requires
    not just our industry but also nation states to be part of that,” he said. His
    final note touched on the importance of regulating AI as the impressive technology
    continues to develop. The need for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/01/microsoft-ceo-tech-companies-need-to-defend-privacy-as-a-human-right.html">ethical
    standards</a> around artificial intelligence is becoming dire, and it’s the responsibility
    of massive tech companies like Microsoft and Apple to reckon with the consequences
    of this innovation.</p><h3><strong>Mark Zuckerberg sees major privacy updates
    coming in 2019</strong></h3><p>In a third-quarter earnings call with analysts,
    Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly claimed that some much-needed privacy
    updates are coming in 2019. “A few years ago, Facebook was very behind where it
    needed to be,” Zuckerberg said. “We started a three-year roadmap through the end
    of 2019 to get our systems to the level where we think we should be at — systems
    that can flag information that we think might be problematic to a much larger
    security and review team.” He went on: “But we are up against sophisticated adversaries
    and threats will continue to evolve.” He reassured them by saying that the company
    is getting better and better at detecting threats and eliminating them.</p><p>More
    specifically, Zuckerberg claimed that the platform has flagged several groups
    from Russia and Iran who have been using social media to sway elections and encourage
    political and social divisions in the U.S., the UK and elsewhere. But he cited
    the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgoldsmith/2018/10/30/facebook-ceo-sees-privacy-security-milestone-in-2019/#693a2aab534b">massive
    growth</a> of Facebook users as the key issue moving forward. Facebook had 2.27
    billion monthly average users in September. It’s estimated that more than 2.6
    billion people now use Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, or Messenger each month.</p><p><img

    Flickr."><em>Via Flickr.</em></p><h3><strong>New security product from Data443
    is a major step forward</strong></h3><p>Data443 released version 1.43 of ClassiDocs
    last week, which is a huge advancement for data privacy tech and GDPR compliance.
    The system uses a Data Repository Owner Identification technology to securely
    manage data, and help businesses comply with GDPR in a number of ways. “Data privacy
    and GDPR response continue to drive IT spending worldwide,” said Jason Remillard,
    founder of Data443. “And these factors are just as important if not more so for
    the vast number of companies that use cloud services to manage and conduct their
    business. Our mission has always been to deliver industry-leading cybersecurity
    products that empower organizations to solve real-life data challenges.”</p><p>Companies
    are expected to spend $124 billion worldwide on information security products
    and services in 2019, and a large portion of that spending is to ensure GDPR compliance.
    And as cloud services become more and more popular, that market increases to an
    estimated $300 billion-plus by 2021. The adoption of cloud services is the way
    of the future, but it increases the need for sophisticated security. <a href="https://martechseries.com/analytics/data-management-platforms/privacy-and-regulations/data443-advances-data-privacy-gdpr-response-newest-classidocs-release/">The
    newest version</a> of ClassiDocs is certainly one of the most comprehensive solutions
    to the problem yet.</p><h3><strong>Bitcoin turns ten years old</strong></h3><p>On
    October 31st, Bitcoin officially turned ten years old. Satoshi Nakamoto first
    submitted the Bitcoin whitepaper to a small cryptography mailing list, and the
    rest was history. CCN created a brief history of the world’s first cryptocurrency,
    and here are some of the highlights:</p><ul><li><p>On January 3, 2009, the first
    block was mined by Nakamoto. Bitcointalk.org, where Nakamoto engaged in important
    discussions, came to life.</p></li><li><p>Mt. Gox, an early exchange, was founded
    in 2010. At some point, however, a bug in the code allowed the exchange to lose
    millions of dollars, which was covered up, essentially turning the site into a
    ponzi scheme.</p></li><li><p>In 2011, the world’s first dark web market called
    the Silk Road went online and chose Bitcoin as its medium of exchange.</p></li><li><p>In

    and all cryptocurrencies.</p></li></ul><p>This is just a <a href="https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-turns-ten/">brief

    Update:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3600/1*58geH1GUB444wfD1G7NY6g.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p><em>Author’s Note, 10/2/2016: The original version of this essay
    appeared in May 2016. I revised this essay in August when <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html?_r=1">Donald
    Trump talked about the “2nd Amendment people” with regard to stopping Hillary
    and/or the Supreme Court</a>. I revised it again today in order to reflect the
    situation we face now, very close to this election. These revisions reflect not
    only the unfolding history we’ve seen over the past several months but my own
    personal evolution on various views as I’ve read more, seen more, volunteered
    more with <a href="http://emilyslist.org/pages/entry/our-mission">Emily’s List</a>
    and, most importantly, listened more. — SB</em></p><p>This is for anybody incorrectly
    claiming that Hillary and Trump are one and the same; telling everybody they won’t
    vote at all; or talking about how they’re going to vote for a third party candidate.
    This essay may not apply to you personally, but you may still find it entertaining
    or educational or what have you. At any rate, here we go.</p><p>Hello. My name
    is Sara Benincasa. I’m an <a href="http://SaraBenincasa.com/books">author</a>
    and a <a href="http://SaraBenincasa.com/events">comedian</a>. That does not mean
    that everything I write is supposed to be amusing. I have a master’s degree in
    teaching from Teachers College at Columbia University. I am an alum of the AmeriCorps
    program. I volunteer with <a href="http://emilyslist.org">Emily’s List</a>. I
    was born and raised in New Jersey. I was Catholic for most of my life. I am a
    registered Independent. I am a feminist and a Democrat. I am a union member. I
    live and work in a small rented apartment in Los Angeles. I have curly hair. I
    was not paid to write this (are you aware you’re on a free website that anyone
    can join? This is a longform platform co-founded by some of Twitter’s co-founders).</p><p>I
    tell you these things to display my interests, my background, and my allegiances
    first and foremost. You will undoubtedly infer some biases based on what I’ve
    said above. You may be right and you may be wrong. What I can say for sure is
    I am not an expert in politics and I am not paid by any campaign. If you did not
    know that before, you do now. And if this essay makes you angry, well, you’re
    just angry at another American with an opinion. Lord knows I’m never going to
    run for public office.</p><p>If you still intend to vote for Donald Trump, you
    can go elsewhere. I’m not going to change your mind. You are willfully ignorant.
    Not stupid. That would be understandable. You are devoted to your ignorance, in
    the face of all evidence to the contrary. You are racist and sexist and you most
    likely hate a lot of people and spend a lot of time telling yourself and everyone
    else, very loudly, that you are a good person. You may also claim to follow Christ.
    Your vision of God is a lie. Also, you have at least two cousins and probably
    a child or two who is incredibly embarrassed by what you say and what you believe.
    This essay is not for you. I’m also not going to read your victorious or angry
    comment. Your opinion, forged in a mix of rage and entitlement, does not matter
    to me. I would help you if you were bleeding in the street and I will vote for
    expansions to programs that will benefit you, and you will take advantage of these
    programs because you are ultimately a hypocrite. Go whack off to the 1999 Playboy
    porno in which your candidate of choice appeared. It’ll be fun.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*41G4ebYpnvAdP6ve2m3C3g.gif"

    I assume is decent and good at heart (I know this is the Internet so that’s a
    generous assumption, but let’s proceed in a spirit of hope here) to vote for Hillary
    Clinton in November. Not because you love Hillary (or Bernie, for whom I would’ve
    campaigned and voted with great enthusiasm if he’d gotten the nomination, and
    not just because I instinctively adore and respect cranky Jewish elders.) Not
    because you love the two-party system (I don’t! Do you? That’s weird! We deserve
    better!) But because we’re dealing with brass tacks reality here, not our dreams.</p><p>No,
    I don’t assume you’re sexist just because you wanted to vote for Bernie as your
    nominee in November. Of course not. I voted for a man, Barack Obama, in 2008 and
    2012. In 2008, I could’ve voted for the ticket with a man and a lady running on
    it. Instead, I voted for the one with two dudes. Does that make me sexist? Sheer
    foolishness. So let’s set that aside.</p><p>I know many good and decent people,
    men and women, <a href="http://time.com/3636430/cisgender-definition/">cis</a>
    and trans, plus <a href="http://genderqueerid.com/gq-faq">genderqueer</a> folks,
    who wanted to vote for Bernie, or for Hillary, or for Jill, or for ALMOST anyone
    but Trump. Yes, Bernie Bros are real. Yes, Hillary people can be annoying. Yes,
    any folks can be awful. I love dudes too! Sometimes ladies also! Sometimes folks
    who don’t conform to gender! Anyway, read on.</p><p>When I was a tiny baby woman
    of 20, I loved Michael Moore’s assertion that Gore and Bush 2 were THE SAME, DAMMIT.
    I loved this because he was funny and smart, this Michael Moore, in my opinion.
    I still dig Michael Moore, though not in an idolatrous way, because I have put
    away most childish things like blind devotion to anyone who says something that
    sounds good but does not bear up to actual analysis. He is a wonderful filmmaker
    and storyteller with whom I do not always agree. He has evolved and so have I.
    And I’m not blaming Michael Moore for Gore losing. He’s an artist. He had an opinion!
    I’m just setting the scene so you can see where I was at in 2000, at age 19 and
    20.</p><p>Other people who I thought were funny and smart and sensible loved Ralph
    Nader, too! Especially this one girl I knew with expensive dreadlocks (yes she
    was white, you silly billy, but you knew that already!) I thought Nader sounded
    great! I recognized he would never ever win the general, so I advocated for Gore.
    But still, this Nader was a delight! Also he made sure we had seatbelts! Were
    you aware? History is fun!</p><p>Then Bush 2 won. Sure, we can talk about corrupt
    Florida and the Supreme Court decision in Bush v. Gore that effectively handed
    Bush the presidency. But imagine a world in which we don’t even get to the Supreme
    Court and in which hanging chads in Florida don’t matter because Gore has such
    a clear and definitive margin of victory.</p><p>Imagine we’re in 2000 and enough
    folks show up to the polls and vote for Gore. He’s CLEARLY and irrefutably way
    ahead of the guy from Texas from the big wealthy family dynasty.</p><p>He wins.</p><p>We
    get a President Gore in 2001, on 9/11 and beyond.</p><p>Quite a nice dream. But
    it’s not what happened.</p><p>In reality, some of us swallowed the lie that Bush
    and Gore were mostly the same. And it is a lie. (And by the way, what’s true is
    that Hillary and Bernie are mostly the same. <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/upshot/the-senate-votes-that-divided-hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders.html?_r=1&referer=http%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com">They
    voted the same way 93% of the time when they were both in the Senate.</a>)</p><p>Anyway,
    then we got President George W. Bush.</p><p>Remember No Child Left Behind? Oh,
    how fun it was to contend with that gem of legislation a few years later when
    I was teaching in the public high school system. Remember abstinence-only education?
    Of course you do; it’s how you had your first child. And your second. They’re
    so cute now!</p><p>And NCLB is just one example. Just one. You pick your own.
    Gore would not have been perfect at all, by any means. But he would’ve been different
    than Bush. I venture to guess that the liberal science nerd from TN who to this
    day <a href="https://www.algore.com">still deeply cares about climate change </a>would’ve
    been a tad bit better.</p><p>My point is this: don’t throw your vote away because
    your ego and your “personal brand” says you’ve got to feel the [fill in the blank
    thing that sounds great but will not lead to the Democrats actually winning the
    presidency in November 2016.] Especially not when Bernie himself, at heart a pragmatist,
    has thrown his support behind Hillary Clinton repeatedly, in public, and is working
    just like Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden and Barack Obama and Michelle Obama to
    defeat Donald Trump, the guy who brags about not paying his taxes.</p><p><center><iframe

    video is it wasn’t set to “Jock Jams ‘98” which I feel we can all agree is a missed
    opportunity.</p><p>Okay, Donald Trump again. Who is he? Oh, he’s a lot of guys.
    <a href="http://WomenCanStopTrump.com">The guy who calls women pigs and dogs.</a>
    The guy who appeared in a porno film yet touts himself as the right choice for
    evangelical Christians (and I’m not anti-porn, I’m anti-hypocrisy. Plus, that
    porn looked stupid.) <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-paris-hilton_us_57ee9373e4b024a52d2ea629?">The
    guy who checked out 12 year old Paris Hilton but “isn’t into that” (don’t worry)
    but yeah, he watched her sex tape.</a></p><p>And remember when Donald Trump talked
    about people murdering Hillary Clinton and/or Supreme Court justices? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0">That
    happened.</a> He locked down the coveted Dylann Roof demo and the rest of his
    base is whatever’s left on the bottom of the chili pot at 7/11 after they empty
    it out at the end of the day — it had potential once (truly delicious potential,
    even!) but congealed into encrusted goo fit only for the least discerning rats.
    If you’re still on his sinking ship, you are culpable and complicit.</p><p>Anyone
    who has worked in domestic violence or with survivors knows that “jokes” or “offhand
    remarks” or “implications” about shooting a lady are not to be dismissed but are
    giant red flags. When I was a teenager volunteering at a women’s crisis center,
    I visited a safe house in my home county for women who needed round-the-clock
    protection from men. The workers there kept a close tab on any comments or “jokes”
    the ex-husbands or ex-boyfriends made or passed on via a friend to the woman in
    question regarding murder. That’s when we’re talking about one man with a gun.
    In this case, we’re talking about a man who is the de facto leader of an army
    of White Walkers with guns.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vW7Vui9XJWDMLW7ejlywxw.png"
    alt="10/10 this dude would vote for Trump."><em>10/10 this dude would vote for
    Trump.</em></p><p>Make your choice and deal with the consequences.</p><p>I get
    it if it makes you feel really good personally to have voted for Bernie in your
    state’s primary. He has many good things to say! He’s done some lovely stuff!
    He is smart and amazing and I admire him a great deal.</p><p>Sadly, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/jill-stein-gary-johnson-foreign-leaders-228899">Dr.
    Jill Stein doesn’t seem very sensible or wise or kind</a>. Trust that I’m always
    biased in favor of a women who is a strong leader and I wanted to see her as an
    important voice in this campaign season but she disappointed the hell out of me
    and a lot of other folks, too. <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/210549/friends-dont-let-friends-vote-for-jill-stein">She
    actually seems like a carnival barker who just wants to get on TV and eventually
    get her deal with whatever speakers bureau picks her up.</a> Kind of like how
    Trump will be selling out midsize amphitheaters in abandoned amusement parks for
    the rest of his life, and how FOX News will give him his own TV show next year.
    Kind of like that, but with the veneer of progressivism.</p><p>Let’s remember
    that when we vote for a Democrat at any level of government in the United States,
    we also vote for the party platform. The DNC platform is vastly superior to the
    GOP platform. You can sure as hell in part credit Bernie and his supporters with
    successfully pushing it to the left. It’s the most progressive platform of any
    major party in American history, in fact. <a href="https://www.demconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Democratic-Party-Platform-7.21.16-no-lines.pdf">Read
    it.</a> It’s really good. And not boring like I thought it would be. It’s real
    and relevant and important. It affects my life, so that’s not boring. (And it’s
    got a table of contents so you can just skip to the parts that most interest you.)</p><p>The
    hard truth is that even if it makes you feel good and brave and strong and different
    to stay home from the polls because you don’t like Hillary or don’t agree with
    things that she has done or said, you are effectively defaulting to Donald Trump.
    I know you’re not actively voting for him, but you are one less vote to widen
    the margin between her and a monster. You’re one less voice actually saying in
    a meaningful way, through a real vote, “Never, ever, ever Trump.” I think about
    2000 and it scares me very much, indeed. There are older people — not just the
    ones in this video — who think of an earlier time and get even more scared than
    I or perhaps you can even imagine.</p><p><center><iframe width="560" height="315"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cKuNveXwmwo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p><p>A
    very angry (straight and white) man once said to me, “I won’t be bullied into
    voting for Hillary.” Dude, nobody is bullying you. It isn’t bullying you to tell
    you harsh truths that don’t fit with what your t-shirt or your bumper sticker
    says.</p><p>But you’re still voting third party, huh, dude? You say you’re “voting
    your conscience”? Nah. You’re voting your ego. A real conscience would want the
    best possible option for the most people in the United States. Even the people
    who don’t look like you or talk like you or make the same amount of money as you.
    Even if the current Democratic nominee wasn’t your favorite, or close to it.</p><p>A
    woman once commented on something I wrote, “I won’t be shamed into voting for
    Hillary.” Ma’am, who is shaming you? (Also, who even are you? I have no idea.)
    Am I out here calling out citizens by name who’ve expressed a desire to vote for
    Jill Stein or Gary Johnson? No. If you feel shame when you read my clear points
    about why a vote for Hillary is the right choice this year, maybe it’s because
    you know in your heart I’m right and you’re embarrassed that you’re afraid to
    admit you changed your mind. Shame is a useless emotion if it does not inspire
    better action in future. I didn’t magically put that shit in your heart. You’re
    projecting.</p><p>And let’s be clear that I’m not voting for Hillary JUST because
    I think she’s more electable. I admire many things about her, too. Too many to
    list all of them here, in fact! But I can say her work ethic, her steady temperament,
    her experience in traveling to 120 countries, her consistent advocacy for equal
    pay for women, her longtime devotion to a real family leave policy, her commitment
    for healthcare for all American kids (not just now, but way back in the ’90s and
    even before then), and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/us/politics/hillary-clinton-speech.html">her
    advocacy for Americans with disabilities</a> and for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/clinton-just-made-a-very-important-announcement--and-hardly-anyone-is-talking-about-it/2016/08/31/5379ddfe-6ef5-11e6-9705-23e51a2f424d_story.html?utm_term=.82935cef4940">folks
    with mental illness</a> — well, all these things excite me and give me hope.</p><p>And
    there are things I do not like. Things that bother me about her. Honestly I’d
    love to see her get elected so I can hold her feet to the fire on real shit instead
    of defending her against false accusations of calling folks basement dwellers,
    something she never did. Here’s that real quote, by the way:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*wy7E7QN2HCO2yXJ9kGhChQ.png"

    It’s never gonna happen. But as long as you get to spit lies and live in your
    fantasy world, I get to live in mine.</p><p>I don’t know Hillary personally. I
    don’t know Bernie personally. I don’t know Donald personally. This is not about
    being a political fangirl or fanboy (I save my fangirling for Doctor Who and 1980s
    and ‘90s games from Sierra Online and obviously Luke Cage, among other worlds
    I love) or doing what will make my friends (most of whom love either Bernie or
    Hillary, nearly all of whom are voting for Hillary) happy.</p><p>This is what
    I think is right for my country in the pragmatic long run where feelings cool
    and your angry or elated reaction to this post is but a mere memory and you and
    I and everyone we know has to actually contend with the policies enacted by our
    president.</p><p>Our president, yours and mine, is either going to be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html">Donald
    Trump, a man who was sued by the Justice Department in the 1970s for having his
    employees write C (for “Colored”) on the applications for housing in the buildings
    he owned</a> (and then he hired Roy Cohn of McCarthyism and “Angels in America”
    fame to defend him)…or…</p><p>Or Hillary Clinton. What was she doing at the same
    time Trump was keeping black people from homes? Read the New York Times article
    <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/28/us/politics/how-hillary-clinton-went-undercover-to-examine-race-in-education.html">“How
    Hillary Clinton Went Undercover to Examine Race in Education”</a> and find out.</p><p>Ask
    yourself: is my ego and my need to be “right” in my own mind and at the Thanksgiving
    dinner table greater than my respect for and compassion for the actual people
    who would suffer terribly under a GOP presidency and the Supreme Court for the
    next 10 to 40 years?</p><p>Because these people are all around you. And you are
    one of them, too.</p><p>Sometimes you make the best choice and you still don’t
    love it. But this is real life. Who ever told us it would be easy?</p><p>We ought
    to have a system in which two parties are not dominant. It’d be great to have
    more than two viable candidates for president. Can you magically make that happen
    by November 8? No? Cool. I also am not a time-bending, reality-shaping wizard.
    Let’s deal with what we’ve got.</p><p>Don’t vote Green.</p><p>Don’t vote Libertarian.</p><p>And
    don’t stay home.</p><p>Vote Democrat. <em>At least</em> at the top of the ticket.</p><p>You
    don’t like Hillary’s past support for military actions in the Middle East and
    other places abroad? Me neither, sometimes! Show me a U.S. president who has never
    made a decision that led to the deaths of innocents at home or (more likely) abroad
    and I will show you a lie. In what world is the leader of any country a saint?
    Saints don’t exist. Saints are a lie we tell ourselves to pretend we can achieve
    perfection here on earth.</p><p>We cannot.</p><p>And if you think that’s an endorsement
    of policies that kill innocent people, you are sorely in need of a course in reading
    comprehension. We can and we should work to effect change in imperialist United
    States foreign policy but I assure you that positive change is not going to come
    from a Donald Trump presidency. This is a man who thinks that Vladimir Putin,
    a dictator who we can safely assume has okayed the murder of journalists, is a
    great guy. A role model, even. (Fun fact: Jill Stein had dinner with him. That
    is a thing that happened.)</p><p>Given our two choices, a Donald Trump is not
    the right one to command the most military power of any leader in the Western
    world.</p><p>Did it surprise you that I, an avowed and enthusiastic Hillary Clinton
    supporter, expressed criticism of my candidate’s history above? Well, I believe
    that if you cannot look critically at your candidate, you will not look critically
    at your President. And that makes you a cult member and a parrot, which is really
    an unkind thing to say about a parrot.</p><p>In the real world, sometimes you
    do not get all of the candy. Sometimes you get a little bit of the candy and that
    is better than getting a pile of actual flaming garbage. Don’t just think about
    yourself. Think about the people who will be affected by the policies of the next
    president, as well as the people who will be affected by the Supreme Court. Unless
    your politics is just about whatever T-shirt you wear, in which case you really
    ought to get more into football.</p><p>You think this is condescending? I think
    it’s frank, honest truth.</p><p>Pretend I’m sitting across from you at a table
    and we’re both drinking something we like and I’m making direct eye contact with
    you in a nonthreatening manner. (I’m five foot two and I’m not very strong or
    terrifying, I assure you.) I’m not your mother, regardless of your opinions about
    her (and neither is Hillary Clinton, it bears mentioning). I’m not your friend.
    I’m just a woman with an opinion. If that scares you, it should. We are mighty.</p><p>Your
    assertion that you can’t in good conscience vote for Hillary is an insult to me
    and women and queer folks and all the people who benefit and even have a chance
    to thrive under Democratic policies. It is an absolute insult. I don’t know if
    you’ve ever had the idea framed to you this way. Consider it, for a moment. You
    can discard it in a minute if you like. But consider it.</p><p>You’d consign us
    to 4 years of Trump and two or three decades of a disgusting, vile Supreme Court
    so you can brag to your friends about how morally superior you are?</p><p>Nope.</p><p>I
    believe you can be better than that. I believe you can go into that booth and
    vote for Hillary. I never need to know about it. You can pretend you didn’t, if
    that’s what passes for social currency in your group or makes you feel better
    for some reason inside yourself.</p><p>You know what a real progressive does?
    They <em>progress</em>. They move forward. Inch by inch, or mile by mile. They
    evolve. They act.</p><p>So please vote for the <a href="http://www.emilyslist.org/candidates/gallery/senate">nine
    pro-choice women Democrats</a> running for Senate seats around the country (three
    of these candidates are women of color.)</p><p>And please vote for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>I
    am not pleading with you. I am simply asking, adult to adult, for all of us.</p><p>And
    I’m not asking you to like it.</p><p>I’m just asking you to do it.</p>'

  :title: Human-Centered Design Should Consider All Humans
  :content: '<p>Human-Centered Design should consider <em>all</em> humans.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6000/1*8HFpmFX69xDTlxOnltaPiw.jpeg" alt="Photo:
    gilaxia/E+/Getty Images"><em>Photo: gilaxia/E+/Getty Images</em></p><p>I remember
    listening carefully to the presentation on the redesign, trying hard to bite my
    tongue and keep my comments until the end. I was still shy, I still felt new,
    and I was battling a serious case of imposter syndrome. It was probably a dumb
    question, anyway. I shouldn’t ask it.</p><p>Easier said than done. I felt the
    question permeating through every fiber of my being, reverberating in my mind
    until it was the only thought I had.</p><p>“Did you get anyone else’s insight
    on this project? Was it just you all? Have you considered how that might be limiting
    at all?”</p><p>For about three seconds, I was relieved that someone asked this
    question. Then, I realized that person was me. Six white faces turned to look
    at me inquisitively. One woman, who looked extra offended, spoke next. She said
    a lot of things, but the crux of it was a lesson in what it means to be a designer.</p><p>“Design
    is about putting yourself in the shoes of your user… that’s what being a designer
    is all about — human-centered design.”</p><p>Some context — this very homogeneous
    team of designers was working to solve one of the most significant challenges
    of our era: redesigning the online immigration system, namely the process by which
    people apply to become citizens of the United States. I can’t overstate how important
    it is to design this properly: it can singlehandedly skew one’s ability to be
    successful in this world.</p><p>Because their users? Terrified, non-English speaking
    immigrants with everything on the line. Families who don’t know the difference
    between a usability test and an interrogation. Mostly brown people. Mostly Spanish
    speakers. And many haunted with stories of separation, deportation, and devastation.
    I don’t need to remind you of the demographics of the designers in the room.</p><p>How
    could this group possibly believe the idea of human-centered design was enough
    of a qualification for them to design for a demographic so far removed from their
    own experiences without at least <em>acknowledging</em> this massive gap?</p><p>Especially
    for a demographic whose fate depended on it?</p><h2>#ffffff Privilege</h2><p>As
    designers, we find ourselves challenged by the need to understand <em>most</em>
    of our users. But what about those who rarely make it in the <em>most</em> bucket?
    The ones our affluent lifestyles tend to shield us from?</p><p>What about the
    single mom of three in Indiana, working two jobs to make ends meet, who just needs
    a to-do list app that she can access on the go? Or the young Black boy in Sanford,
    hesitant to don the hoodie your site is selling after he saw what happened to
    Trayvon Martin? Or maybe the dyslexic girl in El Paso, TX, who spends her evenings
    after school trying to learn English on the website you designed? These users
    often (and unfairly) carry the burden of using a product that was never designed
    for them in the first place.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/NaN/1*vtLrBgK9R1zxD7OAn1D4tA.png"
    alt="1 + 1 = 3. Photo: [Buro Millenial/Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/selective-focus-photo-of-man-using-laptop-1438081/)"><em>1
    + 1 = 3. Photo: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/selective-focus-photo-of-man-using-laptop-1438081/">Buro
    Millenial/Pexels</a></em></p><p>Lucky for them, you, the designer, swoops in,
    ready to solve these problems and empathy the hell out of them. You, like most
    designers, are often white, often conducting remote testing, and often too divorced
    from the environment that led the user to need your product in the first place
    to understand it. Your clipboard is in hand, your sterile, templated usability
    test is ready, and you begin checking task-success rates, speed of completion,
    and general comprehension.</p><p>If marginalized users I mentioned above even
    make it to the usability test— which they often don’t — well, then, you tell yourself
    it’s okay that they hesitated, didn’t understand, swiped instead of scrolled,
    and missed the CTA you and your team carefully architected for their eyes.</p><p>Every
    test has its outliers. And outliers don’t matter. Right?</p><h2>Why Does Any of
    This Matter?</h2><p>It matters because a recent study showed that Americans spend
    an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+hours+do+we+spend+a+day+looking+at+a+screen&oq=how+many+hours+do+we+spend+a+day+looking+at+a+screen&aqs=chrome..69i57j33.6509j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">average
    of 10 hours a day looking at their screen</a>. It matters because as designers,
    we are the architects of an experience that matters just as much as (if not more
    than!) the one we live and breathe.</p><p>We see it in the kids who learn how
    to swipe, pinch, and scroll before they learn how to turn the pages in an actual
    book, in the hands that forget the sensation of picking up a pen to write and
    can never seem to find paper nearby to jot an idea down on (who needs paper anymore?),
    and in the 13-second elevator ride that is too excruciating to experience without
    checking our five-inch digital anchors for a dose of excitement, validation, and
    distraction.</p><p>Our new realities fit into tiny screens and laptops, our emotions
    reduced to 30 variations of the heart emoji in iMessage, our entertainment reduced
    to Netflix, our conversation reduced to Twitter, our human connection reduced
    to Facebook, and so on. Even our meditation to get a break from it all happens
    on Headspace. <strong>Designers quite literally get to decide how we process everything
    from grief to hunger, and what people decide to do about it.</strong> The way
    we access information is rapidly changing, yes, but the way we process is changing
    alongside it.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Q2XYXLWhr70SWqIMxEgTFQ.png"
    alt="Literally 30, lol"><em>Literally 30, lol</em></p><p>There is, then, inherent
    and undeniable power and privilege in being able to shape these experiences for
    the rest of the world.</p><p>An <a href="http://www.nordes.org/nordes2017/assets/cases/nordes17a-sub1034-cam-i26_SONDERGAARD.pdf">article
    by Aarhus University</a> says it best:</p><blockquote><p>Design is an act of power,
    or a potential act of power; that is, how design stages people’s agency, the structures
    that impact people’s agency, and how designed objects themselves seek to perform
    agential power… designing (re)configures agency through the relations between
    the designer, the designed object, people and the context… Whether aware of it
    or not, designers bring values and belief systems into the design practice based
    on their position in the world, and this influences the design in a particular
    way. Arguing that designers influence their design is not a controversial argument
    to make, but when design deliberately engages with power, social change, and the
    political condition, it seems increasingly important that designers critically
    reflect on their agency and position.</p></blockquote><h2>Rethinking Human-Centered
    Design</h2><p>The woman in my story used human-centered design as a crutch to
    support her reasoning for why any person should be able to easily design for another’s
    (vastly different) experiences. She was able to do so because HCD is based in
    a word designers seem to throw around more and more these days: <em>empathy</em>.
    Taken to the extreme, if you believe you have enough empathy, no two people are
    too different — meaning you can design for anyone.</p><p>You could even design
    for someone you know nothing about because our baseline assumption is that human
    beings are fundamentally the same. And as I was reminded by a mentor today, cognitively,
    we are. We’re all more or less subjected to the same ergonomic and cognitive constraints.</p><p>*<em>But
    human beings are fundamentally *different</em>, too. *<em>Designing for shared
    experiences pre-supposes that most or even all experiences are shared, when they
    are often intrinsically different. While problem statements can be ubiquitous—</em>“How
    do we fix our cities? How do we increase productivity? How do we make healthcare
    accessible?”—*we experience the solutions to these problems quite differently.</p><p><img

    Mars/Pexels</a></em></p><p>Is your grief-processing app acknowledging how different
    cultures, religions, and age groups handle sadness and loss? Is your travel app
    designed to include safety tips for women traveling alone? Does your note-taking
    app have settings for people who are visually impaired, or who may need to record
    voice notes instead?</p><p>Or, less hypothetically — if facial recognition is
    making it easier for us to use our phones, does it <a href="https://gizmodo.com/can-we-make-non-racist-face-recognition-1827639249">recognize
    faces with darker skin tones</a>? When Nikon’s S630 cameras were released, did
    they <a href="http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1954643,00.html">assume
    all East Asians who were smiling were blinking</a> instead? When Apple released
    the oximeter feature on its Apple Watches, why <a href="https://thegrio.com/2015/05/01/apple-watch-dark-skin/">didn’t
    they work on people with dark or tattooed skin</a>? (Could it have anything to
    do with the fact that <a href="https://www.complex.com/life/2015/11/racist-technology/apple-watch">Apple
    tests its products with its executive team</a>, the top 10 of whom are all white?)</p><p>True
    implementation of human-centered design practices ensures designers are focused
    on how we are different just as much as on how we may be the same. These differences
    allow us to design for everyone by designing for accessibility, internationalization,
    varying levels of tech literacy, socioeconomic status, race, gender, sexual orientation,
    and more.</p><p>Where does that leave you?</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7842/1*oqsdhh9RJ0fNDztqE5-stQ.png"

    Responsibility of All Designers</h2><p>Can you design for someone you don’t know?
    You can, you have, you do, and you will. That part of designing will never go
    away. We have the real privilege of being able to help facilitate people’s lives
    the way we do.</p><p>But in the immortal words of Uncle Ben, God rest his soul:
    “With great power comes great responsibility.”</p><p>Knowing what we know about
    how little we know, it is our responsibility to constantly force ourselves to
    be introspective about the lens with which we observe the world, especially our
    users. It is our responsibility to approach the problems we have been appointed
    to solve with the humility they deserve, by acknowledging first and foremost that
    our perspective is as limited as the experiences we were afforded.</p><p>It is
    also our responsibility to consume information that challenges what we believe,
    to regularly check both the assumptions and the privileges that shape the products
    we build every day, and to meet our users where <em>they</em> are.</p><p>It is
    our responsibility to actively seek the “outliers” that seem to be shrinking data
    points in the metrics that define our work — data points that are often representatives
    of entire populations who never seem to make it to the whiteboard as a compelling
    enough reason to alter a design.</p><p>Most importantly, it is our responsibility
    to create diverse teams that are able to truly relate to, empathize with, and
    understand marginalized users. It is here that change will truly take root, and
    design will truly begin to not just be human-centered, but <em>all</em>-humans-centered.</p><p>I’ll
    leave you where Brian LaRossa left me in his brilliantly crafted <a href="https://designobserver.com/feature/privilege-centered-design/39602">essay</a>
    on privilege in design:</p><blockquote><p>It matters whom we observe. It matters
    how we imagine. It plots a course through the design process, a path that is wrought
    with consequence. If we only observe and imagine those who resemble ourselves,
    then what we call empathy is merely introspection. The majority of designers are
    white. There is a privileged ouroboros of customer empathy that leaves so many
    others out of the loop. Awakening to privilege is often framed as an irreversible
    process — like biting an apple. But “woke” is not a permanent state for those
    of us in the majority. Privilege is a poppy field. It’s impossible to witness
    the way your own snoring prevents others from sleeping. Still, we have an obligation
    to wrench our eyes open again and again, an obligation to look inclusively (not
    just internally), an obligation to empathize with the whole audience and imagine
    them with care, and an obligation to be sensitive to the margins around us. If
    we don’t succeed in holding ourselves responsible for meeting these baseline obligations,
    then the things we design will only serve to keep others like us asleep.“The Dreamers
    will have to learn to struggle themselves, to understand that the field for their
    Dream, the stage where they have painted themselves white, is the deathbed of
    us all.”— Ta-Nehisi Coates</p></blockquote><p><em>For more nonsense, follow me

    The Gathering is a fantasy card game by Richard Garfield, Ph.D. and Wizards of
    the Coast centered on a “color wheel” in which five distinct colors in a particular
    order represent five different flavors of magic. How this works in actual gameplay
    is irrelevant to this post, which instead exists to explore the <em>philosophy</em>
    of the MTG color wheel, and how that philosophy is a near-enough-to-be-thought-provoking
    match for reality.</p><p>Personalities, organizations, goals, and means can all
    be thought of in terms of the Magic colors they typify, allowing you to draw interesting
    connections, make surprisingly useful predictions, identify deficits and growth
    areas, and increase empathy. I claim that the Magic system, which was <em>designed</em>
    to be resonant and trope-y and archetypal, does a lot of the same good work that
    naming things does, and is a richer intuition pump than other popular wrong-but-usefuls
    like Enneagram or MBTI or chakras or the integral theory colors.</p><p>Below are
    the five colors of Magic: white, blue, black, red, and green.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3996/1*Z1EsZeDVHwsyX4K1WSkjDQ.png"

    seeks <em>peace,</em> and it tries to achieve that peace through the imposition
    of <em>order. *White believes that the solution to all suffering and unhappiness
    is coordination and cooperation and rules and restraint. The archetypal white
    organization would be a church, and a white dystopia would be a fascist regime
    such as the one in George Orwell’s *1984</em>, or a stagnant society like the
    one in Lois Lowry’s <em>The Giver.</em></p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*l2llQ_yQq2a8Rxr0rRIp_g.png"

    from pop culture include Brienne of Tarth from <em>Game of Thrones</em>, Ozymandias
    from <em>Watchmen,</em> Superman, McGonagall from <a href="http://hpmor.com">*Harry
    Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a>*, and Marge from *The Simpsons. *In
    the actual game of Magic, white cards are angels and knights and clerics and loyal
    steeds, healing spells and protective auras and laws that bind all parties equally,
    and anthems that strengthen all of your allies at once.</p><p>Victory for a white
    agent feels like brightness, purity, exaltation — a clean breeze sweeping across
    a high plain under a bright sun. Defeat feels like watching the corrosion creep
    forward, the great monuments crumble, or the enemy pouring over the gates, knowing
    that the goodness of the world is unraveling.</p><p><strong>Other words associated
    with white:</strong>* authority, compassion, community, contribution, fairness,
    happiness, honesty, justice, kindness, leadership, peace, religion, responsibility,
    security, service, trustworthiness, altruism, cleanliness, commitment, consistency,
    duty, conviction, courtesy, dedication, discipline, endurance, gratitude, honor,
    integrity, patience, poise, respect, teamwork, tradition, unity, valor, honor,
    formality, generosity, protectiveness, asceticism, authoritarianism, morality,
    fanaticism, intolerance*</p><p><em>~Extraversion+Agreeableness++Conscientiousness*–
    *Neuroticism*– — *Openness</em></p><p>A white agent, when presented with a decision
    or quandary, asks <em>what is the *</em>right *<em>course of action to take,</em>
    where “right” depends on their moral or cultural framework.</p><p><strong>Blue</strong>
    seeks <em>perfection,</em> and it tries to achieve that perfection through the
    pursuit of <em>knowledge.</em> Blue believes that things could be almost arbitrarily
    good if we could all just figure out the truth, and then apply that understanding
    to its fullest extent. The archetypal blue organization would be a university
    or a research lab, and a blue dystopia would be one in which efficiency were pursued
    without morals or limits<em>,</em> or in which intelligence were the sole axis

    Of the Simpsons, Homer is the one who best embodies the spirit of red. In Magic,
    red cards are goblins and pyromancers and dragons, Lightning Bolts that burn the

    a brawl or a love affair, the feeling of cresting a summit or having successfully
    ridden a wave. It’s feeling <em>alive.</em> Defeat for a red agent is correspondingly
    quiet, empty, and gray — being trapped by things you can’t even pinpoint, to rail

    to find in the role of the protagonist, but often crop up around the edges of
    a story. If green had a martial art, it would be aikido — a sort of bending, accepting
    formlessness backed by subtle power. Both Yoda from <em>Star Wars</em> and Guinan
    from <em>Star Trek</em> are green, as is Tom Bombadil from <em>Lord of the Rings.
    *Buffy (the vampire slayer) has other colors but moves toward green as she embraces
    her destiny and, on the more feral side, Wolverine from *X-Men *often acts from
    green. The centaur society in *HPMOR</em> is green, in that they had sworn not
    to set themselves against destiny, even if it meant the end of all things. Our
    last Simpson, Maggie, is green as well, but that’s got more to do with her age
    than her fundamental character. In the game, green cards are druids and sages,
    mighty monsters and howling wolves, auras that restore the natural order and regenerate
    the wounded, and bursts of magic that produce enormous, feral strength or quell
    entire battles.</p><p>Victory for a green agent feels peaceful, fertile, and balanced
    — a tired general retiring to his farm, a mother nursing her baby, a valley lush
    with growth now that the rains have come and the pestilence has passed. It’s solemn,
    but without sadness; joyful, but without ego. Defeat, on the other hand, feels
    like having no ground beneath your feet, like being cut off from your tribe and

    wisdom?</em></p><p>A world without white is a world of unreliability, with no
    scaffolds or handrails, no rules or recourse, no sense of fairness and no moral
    compass. White is the hard and durable skeleton of society, and without it, much
    of the cooperation and coordination that we rely and depend upon vanishes — even
    things like driving on a particular side of the road.</p><p>A world without blue
    is a world without curiosity, without investigation, without the nitpicking desire
    to get every cog into <em>just</em> the right place. More than any other color,
    blue represents what makes humanity <em>different</em> from other animals, other
    species — without it, we sink back into the present and lose our bridge to the
    future.</p><p>A world without black is a horror show of codependency, with all
    the inefficiencies of communist Russia and all of the insipid conformity of the
    town in <em>Footloose</em> or the society in <em>Equilibrium</em> or the people
    in the parable of the Emperor’s New Clothes. It’s a place where the sovereignty
    and nobility of the individual vanishes beneath the weight of the collective —
    it looks good at first, but without black, you lose the will to empire, the thirst
    for recognition, the desire to get ahead, the deep and personal wants that define
    and shape a person’s whole destiny. What’s left is pleasant, but there’s no soul
    at the core of it — nothing that burns with the hunger for something <em>more.</em></p><p>A
    world without red lacks a different sort of fire — it’s a world that has wanting,
    but no <em>passion…</em>only a base and selfish grasping, with no real spark behind
    it. It’s a world where the rules never change, where the assumptions are never
    questioned, a world without teenage love and modern art and violent protests and
    spur-of-the-moment adventures. Without red, everything moves in slow motion and
    everything has its temperature turned down — like an entire society that’s been
    sedated.</p><p>A world without green, on the other hand, is a world unmoored from
    reality and disconnected from its own history. It’s a world full of bold schemes
    that fail to pan out, disasters that take generations to build momentum but are
    noticed too late. It’s a world where everything is out of place — where nothing
    truly even <em>has</em> a place — a constant parade of divorces and suicides and
    famines and extinctions, where things like global warming and eugenics and welfare
    programs with misaligned incentives happen <em>all the time.</em> It’s a world
    where the qualities that people derive from Zen Buddhism, or from the contemplation
    of a sunset, or from a hike in the mountains, or from the embrace of a grandmother,
    or from the sermon of an ancestor, are all entirely absent. It’s a place where
    you eat and eat and eat, but you never feel truly <em>full.</em></p><p>In addition
    to being defined by goals and methods, the five colors also disagree with one
    another in meaningful ways. There are five central *conflicts *between colors
    on opposite sides of the wheel, which help to define them in contrast with one
    another.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3996/1*Yf59VVey9kS6yuHo5Cs41g.png"
    alt=""></p><p>White and black disagree about the relationship between the individual
    and the group. White prioritizes the group over the individual, and black does
    the opposite. The phrase “all for one and one for all” is white, whereas the spirit
    of individual sovereignty expressed in Ayn Rand’s philosophy is black. From white’s
    perspective, black is selfish and evil; from black’s perspective, white is naive
    and coercive.</p><p>Black and green disagree about the relationship between the
    individual and the surrounding environment. Green is the color of evolution and
    thriving, and believes in balance and evolved order, wanting to preserve the existing
    status quo. Black, on the other hand, sees only unclaimed resources waiting to
    be exploited. From green’s perspective, black is short-sighted and unbalanced;
    from black’s perspective, green is stagnant and irresolute. A black agent might
    try to create a strip mine; a green agent is more likely to build an animal sanctuary.</p><p>Green
    and blue disagree on questions of determinism and free will. Green believes that
    there is a niche for everyone, and that genetics and environment determine personality
    and potential. Blue believes in “tabula rasa,” and holds to the claim that anyone
    can become anything, given the proper nurturing, education, and opportunity. From
    green’s perspective, blue is hubristic and unwilling to hear the wisdom of the
    ages; from blue’s perspective, green is complacent and stuck in its ways.</p><p>(You
    may be noticing echoes of criticisms, such as blue and black each harboring similar
    dissatisfactions with green. This is a feature, not a bug; blue and black are
    *allies *and part of that alliance is a shared frustration with their common enemy.
    More on this below.)</p><p>Blue and red disagree about strategy. Blue believes
    that the best results will be achieved if you think carefully and let reason and
    logic carry the day, while red believes that it’s too easy to waste time and talk
    yourself in circles, and that you should instead follow your heart and listen
    to your gut. Blue sees red as impulsive and rash; red sees blue as repressed and
    unfeeling and unwilling to act.</p><p>Red and white disagree on questions of structure
    and commitment. Red is episodic, suspicious of rules and order because they constrain
    one’s ability to grow and change and freely choose. White is more diachronic,
    interested in finding the small compromises and sacrifices that will allow people
    to build trust and cooperate reliably. Where red sees cages, white sees scaffolds,
    and vice versa.</p><p>To understand what adjacent colors <em>agree</em> on, look
    at what they <em>both</em> disagree with their mutual enemy about.</p><p><img

    and blue are the enemies of red, which they see as unfettered and chaotic. White
    and blue both agree that <em>structure</em> is important — white because it reduces
    the risk of conflict, and blue because it makes possible deep investigation and
    long-term or delicate optimization. Jean-Luc Picard from <em>Star Trek</em> is
    an excellent example of a white/blue archetype, as is the political persona of
    Hillary Clinton.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3988/1*n-lB3OU1huCjwJgX-7ts-g.png"

    agent asks the question <em>how do we *</em>know** what’s right and good?*The
    whole concept of a “rationality technique” is extremely white/blue — the idea
    that we might create carefully defined, algorithmic heuristics for doing things
    better according to some outside standard is not one that other color combinations
    are likely to produce. Effective Altruism is also a white/blue movement, though
    it makes efforts to reach out to red (compassion) and black (taking the long view
    on self-interest).</p><p>Blue and black are the enemies of green, which they see
    as complacent and passive. Blue and black both agree on <em>growth mindset</em>
    — the idea that one is not defined by one’s origins or constrained to the role
    society has set. Blue/black characters are often intelligent, clever, arrogant,
    and aloof — notable examples include Odysseus from <em>The Odyssey</em>, Sherlock
    Holmes, Lex Luthor, and Quirinus Quirrell from <em>HPMOR</em>.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3988/1*tzoGuritHz7hrkJMqLvkCA.png"

    question <em>how can I *</em>best** achieve my goals? *It’s fair to describe blue/black
    as the combination of “enlightened self-interest,” which is why it’s not surprising
    to find it overrepresented in communities like LessWrong and Silicon Valley, which
    see themselves as attempting to disrupt the status quo for the better. Transhumanism
    is a fundamentally blue-black worldview, in opposition to the green imperative
    to accept death as a crucial and inevitable part of life.</p><p>Black and red
    are the enemies of white, which they see as invasive and tyrannical. Black and
    red both agree that <em>independence</em> is something to be fostered and defended
    — red in an attempt to avoid coercion or pressure, and black out of a desire for
    self-reliance and agency. Many black/red characters lean evil, such as the Joker
    from <em>Batman</em> and Voldemort from canon <em>Harry Potter</em>, but the combination
    can also be one of impishness or chaotic selfishness, as with Peter Pan, Deadpool,
    or Cap’n Jack Sparrow. Achilles from <em>The Iliad</em> is black/red, as is the
    political persona of Donald Trump and the protagonist of *The Fountainhead, *Howard
    Roark.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3988/1*-nFunhM6fAmvZiIgd_2mNw.png"

    question <em>how do I get what I *</em>want**? *Because of its dismissive attitude
    toward judgment and social mores, black/red is often the combination of endorsed
    hedonism and “live and let live.” The BDSM and kink communities are fundamentally
    black/red, for example, with many of their norms intended to facilitate the healthy
    expression of urges and desires that are delegitimized and disincentivized in
    broader society.</p><p>Red and green are the enemies of blue, which they see as
    icy, disconnected, and cerebral. Red and green both agree on the importance of
    <em>authenticity</em> — green from a place of wildness and immediacy, and red
    from a place of passion and self-actualization. Dionysian archetypes are red/green,
    as is Tinkerbell and the Hulk, and the parts of Wolverine that <em>aren’t</em>
    green are usually red. On the gentler side of things, Aang from <em>Avatar: The
    Last Airbender</em> is firmly red/green and is often torn between his innate red
    playfulness and the gravity and responsibility required of his green role and
    destiny.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3988/1*wU9CSRCKuRi5OkIv8688yQ.png"

    question <em>where am I now, and where should I go?</em> A real-life activity
    that embodies red/green is Circling (à la the Authentic Relating community), which
    in part emphasizes setting aside narratives and frames and just being <em>present</em>,
    in the moment, with yourself and other people.</p><p>Green and white are the enemies
    of black, which they see as selfish, short-sighted, and ultimately self-defeating.
    They both agree on <em>community</em> — that the whole can be greater than the
    sum of its parts, and that there are things larger than oneself that are worth
    sacrificing for. Hufflepuff House from <em>Harry Potter</em> is a green/white
    institution, and Akela from <em>The Jungle Book</em> is a green/white archetype.
    Other examples of people and characters in this space include Confucius, Jesus,
    Rufio from <em>Hook</em>, and Obi-Wan Kenobi (as played by Alec Guinness).</p><p><img

    for G/W in the game of Magic is “Selesnya.”)</em></p><p>A green/white agent asks
    the question <em>what’s fair and good? *Green/white institutions tend to be centered
    around compassionate endeavors, but if they go astray it’s in the direction of
    well-meaning lost purposes and wasted signaling — a lack of blue’s epistemic hygiene
    — rather than in the direction of cold, heartless efficiency or relentless pursuit
    of knowledge or the bottom line. They include institutions like the YMCA, Habitat
    for Humanity, Teach for America, the Lions’ Club, Meals on Wheels, the Boy Scouts
    and the Girl Scouts, and most small-town churches — basically any organization
    whose primary purpose is to foster the web of connection between people and to
    maintain the society’s culture. Some of the institutions above may lean in the
    direction of red or blue, but they’re *primarily</em> green/white.</p><p>In addition
    to serving as a foil for its enemies, each color can also serve as a bridge connecting
    its two allies. White ties together the orderly tendencies of green and blue,
    though green and blue disagree on <em>how</em> that order should come to be. Blue
    believes in careful planning, which both white and black would agree with. Black’s
    focus on personal agency and personal satisfaction rhymes with blue’s desire for
    perfection and red’s desire for freedom. Red’s spontaneity lies in a middle ground
    between green’s wildness and black’s ego-centrism. And green’s serenity ties into
    the fundamental belief that life is good, which is shared by both red and white.</p><p>Although
    the enemy colors are defined by their disagreement, they can also have a harmony
    of their own.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3996/1*jIuehOi_3wGUHXE-fqY7kQ.png"
    alt=""></p><p>The enemy colors white and black combine to form <em>tribalism</em>
    — the “us versus them” mentality<em>. *Think Don Corleone and the other gangsters
    from *The Godfather *— a strict system of codes and honor within the group, and
    almost total impunity with outsiders. Other fictional examples of white/black
    include the character Rorschach from *Watchmen *(who would probably also get along
    with the Punisher) and Magneto from *X-Men.</em></p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3988/1*PsVVDNmWwie8GWnGTCqEpQ.png"

    <em>who’s in my circle of concern? *In our own society, the two major political
    parties have *absolutely</em> become white/black in their motivations in recent
    years, with the most disappointing example being the Republican party’s unwillingness
    or inability to do anything about the excesses of the president. You can also
    see the white/black ingroup-outgroup dynamic in certain swaths of social justice
    culture — there are activists who implicitly hold a scarcity mindset and believe
    that social progress is largely a zero-sum game, and thus react poorly when other
    causes threaten to steal the spotlight and siphon off society’s attention, sympathy,
    and resources.</p><p>(Note that “tribalism” is more <em>a *thing that can describe
    the W/B philosophy than *the</em> thing. There’s variability in any specific framing
    of a given color pair. You can treat them as a perfect balance, or as one color
    tinged by the other, or as something more like “Color A scaffolded with Color
    B.” Rorschach, for instance, uses black methods to achieve white ends, whereas
    Machiavelli uses white methods to achieve black ends, and Harvey Dent/Two-Face
    from Batman simply switches back and forth between all-white and all-black.)</p><p>Blue
    and red taken together are the colors of creativity. Passion combined with perfection,
    freedom combined with investigation — blue/red is the pairing that most typifies
    wild artistry and mad science. Although Tony Stark from <em>Iron Man</em> started
    out blue/black, he ended up blue/red. Willy Wonka is also a blue/red archetype,
    as are Doc Brown from <em>Back to the Future</em> and Indiana Jones.</p><p><img

    mentality in today’s society. One need only remember how <a href="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAoUAAAAJGRlOWRjZDc0LWVlMDAtNGFjZC04YzBmLWQ4YjVjNmZmZTg1Nw.jpg">The

    blue/red at their core.</p><p>Black and green share a sense of <em>profanity *(by
    which I don’t mean anything to do with foul language, but rather the absence of
    the sacred and the clean). Black/green is the combination that gets down in the
    dirt with rot and filth and maggots and worms, the combination that embraces the
    cycle of life and death and rebirth. It’s Tyler Durden shouting at his minions
    *“You are not special; you are made of the same decaying organic matter as everything
    else; you are all a part of the same compost heap.”</em> It’s the beautiful products
    of evolution, and the fact that they clawed their way into existence through a
    billion generations of suffering and death. It’s necromantic magic and dank, fetid
    caves and the laughter of mad, inscrutable gods whose wrath and clemency are both
    beyond the need for justification. It’s being a program that screwed itself into
    existence running on a computer made of meat. It’s not caring about getting your
    hands dirty, because there’s literally no other way to get the job done.</p><p><img

    black/green agent asks the question <em>what costs must be paid to achieve the
    ideal? *Notable black/green characters are hard to come by, but they include Lilith,
    Bagheera from *The Jungle Book</em>, and Poison Ivy from <em>Batman.</em> Circe
    from <em>The Odyssey</em> is black/green, as are the eponymous Shrek and Frankenstein’s
    Monster. Both the Borg from <em>Star Trek</em> and the zombies of <em>The Walking
    Dead</em> are black/green antagonists. In our own society, certain branches of
    ecoterrorists and social justice activists are firmly in this class, and a lot
    of the actions taken by PETA seem to emerge from black/green motivations.</p><p>Meanwhile,
    red and white are the colors of <em>heroism</em> — of passion channeled through
    morality, and adherence to laws that may be higher than law. The best of warriors,
    soldiers, and vigilantes is red/white, as are heroes and martyrs. Examples include
    Daredevil, Robin Hood, and the Weasley twins from <em>Harry Potter *(Gryffindor
    is a red/white House), as well as V from *V for Vendetta *and Prince Zuko from
    *Avatar: The Last Airbender *(at least, near the end of their arcs)</em>.*Captain
    Kirk is red/white where Picard is white/blue, and Albus Dumbledore was red/white
    in his youth before his war with Grindelwald matured him.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3988/1*Oe7F1ekqrgL81R5v6pqBNQ.png"
    alt="(“Boros”)"><em>(“Boros”)</em></p><p>A red/white agent asks the question *what
    needs to be done? What would a good person do? *In the 2016 presidential race,
    Bernie Sanders was attempting to position himself as the red/white candidate in
    contrast to Clinton’s blue/white and Trump’s red/black, and there are strong red/white
    motivations in the people who continue to support his platform and push back against
    the current political status quo.</p><p>Lastly, blue/green is the combination
    of <em>truth seeking.</em> While they disagree strongly about what to <em>do</em>
    with understanding, both blue and green are deeply committed to seeing and understanding
    the world as it is, with blue pursuing knowledge and green striving for wisdom.
    The <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Tarski">Litany of Tarski</a>
    is a central expression of blue philosophy, while the <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Gendlin">Litany
    of Gendlin</a> is as green as it gets. Albus Dumbledore was blue/green in his
    old age, as was Uncle Iroh from <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender. *The character
    Morpheus from *The Matrix</em> played a blue/green role in the plot, and the dragon
    from <em>Grendel</em> was an omniscient blue/green foil for the title character.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3988/1*4XcGAXX6aY938CzHJ7Waeg.png" alt="(“Simic”)"><em>(“Simic”)</em></p><p>A
    green/blue agent asks the question <em>what do I not yet understand? *The two
    most available and resonant examples of blue/green mentality in our society are
    genetic engineering, and Gendlin’s Focusing. Genetic engineering is maybe the
    central case of “see what’s *there</em>, so that you can rearrange it to make
    it better.” And Focusing lies directly between Tarski and Gendlin, as people engage
    curiously and openly with what they already know and feel beneath the surface.</p><p>Just
    as enemy colors can agree, so too can adjacent, allied colors disagree, usually
    in ways that involve siding with their <em>other</em> allies. White and blue disagree
    about individual sovereignty, with white siding with green and blue siding with
    black. Blue and black disagree about the importance of systems and structures
    in a way that rhymes with the disagreement between white and red. Black leans
    more toward trickery and artifice and deception, along with blue, whereas red
    leans more toward guilelessness and being genuine, along with green. Red and green
    disagree over roles and destiny, with red wanting to buck the niche that green
    has ready for it, and green and white disagree over whether order ought be designed
    or evolved.</p><p>Note also that there’s nothing limiting color identities to
    one or two colors — Captain America, for instance, is (appropriately) red/white/blue,
    and Dr. Jekyll swaps from blue/red to red/green as he transforms into Mr. Hyde
    (or possibly blue/black/red to red/black/green). I myself am green/blue with a
    strong splash of red, though this post has largely been white in both motivation
    and execution (and thus a bit outside my comfort zone).</p><p>Often, a person
    who’s three colors won’t draw evenly from all three — for instance, someone who’s
    blue-black-red might identify heavily with blue-black’s growth mindset and red’s
    sense of presence and passion, but <em>not *particularly resonate with “creativity”
    or “independence.” But for the sake of argument, you could imagine a balanced
    trio as [the sum of its two-color connections] and [the absence of whatever the
    two remaining colors agree upon]. Some slightly cheesy and horoscope-y examples
    below (note that the cheesiness is *because</em> I’m trying to describe a general
    archetype, rather than pulling from specific subsets of each color as I would
    with a real, narrow example):</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3996/1*_-cUsXntkBTNfLVF-X8rLA.png"

    alt="“Bant”"><em>“Bant”</em></p><p>Hopefully it’s easy to see how slight tweaks
    to make one color more prominent or another less crucial can result in a <em>lot</em>
    of different “flavors.” Another important point is that, since each color is a
    large bucket and people are small and specific, a person who’s e.g. mono-red is
    not necessarily <em>less complex</em> than a person who’s e.g. green-blue. It
    just means that the red person drew <em>most</em> of their traits from that one
    bucket, whereas the multicolored person drew fewer traits from each of more buckets.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6000/1*zDW9H_6Ilf2VehtPdGXwRQ.png" alt=""></p><p>Beyond
    three colors, though, you start to lose the <em>point</em> of the color wheel,
    which is to serve as an intuition pump and a correlative, predictive archetype
    set. <em>All</em> people contain all five colors to one degree or another; <em>all</em>
    people are capable of acting from any combination. The point is not to say “Person
    X is red/white <em>and nothing else”</em> so much as it is to say “if we abstract
    away some of the detail at the tail ends of the graph, and treat Person X as if
    they’re a red/white archetype, how does that recontextualize our understanding
    of their behavior and motivations? What predictions does that allow us to make,
    about other traits they might have or how they’ll respond to various situations
    or stimuli?”</p><p>Obviously, it’s good to be able to paint with all the colors
    of the wheel, and to have in your own personal toolkit access to the strengths
    and perspectives of all five (just as it’s good to embody the virtues of every
    Hogwarts house, and to be able to access every chakra). But color identity isn’t
    about what you <em>can and can’t do,</em> it’s about where you <em>tend to live.</em>
    Rarely do you see someone who equally embodies each of four or five colors, even
    though <em>many</em> people are capable of embodying any, in a pinch.</p><p>If
    you want a system that captures someone’s <em>full</em> essence, with all of the
    nuance and detail — well, you’re out of luck; I don’t think that system exists.
    But certainly there are things that try, like Big 5 analyses and MBTI. The color
    wheel is a more limited tool <em>on purpose</em>, just like sorting people into
    Hogwarts Houses (where you <em>have</em> to pick one).</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3998/1*sQcpHoGupN6w7l9NzthoQg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Okay, that’s the color wheel. Now what do we <em>do</em> with it?</p><p>In
    essence: classify things, and then make predictions based on those classifications.</p><p>By
    tentatively assigning things a color label (whether that thing be a whole person
    or a particular endeavor or even just a specific sentence), you can boot up a
    set of associations that allow you to prioritize your search-and-predict algorithms.
    The claim isn’t that a person who exhibits one aspect of redness will <em>definitely
    exhibit</em> all of the others, it’s that the bucket “red” is robust and trope-y
    and resonant enough that one red trait is *decent circumstantial evidence *of
    the existence of others.</p><p>(It’s worth noting that the colors speak largely
    to <em>goals *and</em> means.* Traits like “good” or “evil” do not map to the
    color wheel, since every color has ways in which it can be either. Similarly,
    emotions like love and hate can crop up in every color, as can characteristics
    like compassion or gregariousness or elegance — the difference is in how people
    <em>respond</em> to those emotions and those characteristics. All of the colors
    can feel strong emotion, but red responds to them by <em>following</em> them,
    while blue responds to them by *investigating *them. All of the colors can be
    polite, but white does so out of pro-sociality, whereas black does so transactionally.)</p><p>This
    is where I get the greatest benefit from the color wheel, myself — in interpreting
    <em>how and why</em> people have the reactions they have to various stimuli, and
    in predicting <em>what they’ll do next.</em></p><p>For instance, I had a friend
    once who was suffering from a fairly serious bout of depression, to the point
    that they found themselves frequently having suicidal thoughts. Several of our
    mutual acquaintances had tried to help, in some fairly standard ways — they’d
    encouraged them to exercise regularly and try to repair their eating and sleeping
    habits, they’d tried to schedule regular visits to keep them company, and they’d
    asked them to commit to calling if things got particularly dark.</p><p>However,
    every single intervention just seemed to make things worse. My friend was chafing
    under every attempt to help, adding frustration and explosiveness to what was
    already a heavy emotional load.</p><p>What helped (for me) was connecting all
    of this anecdotal data to my prior, cached sense that this friend was <em>red.</em>
    Booting up my color wheel knowledge was a significant sense-making maneuver —
    suddenly, I had a <em>hypothesis *about what was going wrong. I realized that
    every attempted intervention had been orderly, structural — putting them on an
    exercise schedule, turning their life into a routine, forcing them into a *contract</em>
    that said that, in their most desperate and painful moments, they were <em>obligated</em>
    to pick up the phone and call — it was all white, white, white, white, white,
    and each new offer of help was like an additional bar being added to the cage.</p><p>The
    hypothesis generated a next action, too — I drove to their house, told them to
    get in my car, and started driving.</p><p>“Where are we going?” they asked.</p><p>“Dunno.
    Doesn’t matter. Any place you want to go?”</p><p>They were silent for a while.
    “Beach,” they said finally.</p><p>It’s not like this intervention fixed everything,
    of course. But it <em>did</em> make it better — that was a good day, for my friend,
    and in addition to the object level benefits of a day at the beach, I was able
    to <em>stop kicking them accidentally while they were down.</em></p><p>A white
    character who’s depressed is going to want to do exercise routines and contracts-to-call.</p><p>A
    blue one is going to want to talk it over and figure out exactly what’s wrong.</p><p>A
    black one is going to want to take action — to regain locus of control.</p><p>A
    red one is going to want fewer constraints, and permission to just <em>feel</em>.</p><p>And
    a green one is going to be looking for ways to let go of the pain. To make peace
    with the parts of the situation they’re not going to be able to change.</p><p>The
    key recognition is that <em>all of these ways of being are okay.</em> They’re
    all good, they’re all evolved and refined, they’re all adaptive and workable.</p><p>But
    they’re <em>different. *If you’re blue/green and you walk around implicitly believing
    that everyone else is, too, you’re going to be *confused *and *disappointed</em>
    at how everyone is just <em>regularly</em> screwing up, and how they don’t even
    <em>notice</em> it.</p><p>If you’re mono-black, you’re going to see Machiavellian
    machinations *everywhere, *and you may not be able to tell the difference between
    someone trying to manipulate you and someone who’s actually just being their genuine
    self.</p><p>If you’re super red, you’re going to be confused as hell when your
    longtime partner starts talking about wanting to get married. If you’re hardcore
    white, you may not even be able to <em>tolerate</em> polyamory.</p><p>It’s all
    about perspective, and interpretation, and inference, and connotation. If I see
    someone staunchly defending the status quo, I boost my credence in a label of
    <em>green-white.</em> If I see someone vigorously defending their autonomy and
    freedom and refusing to make solid commitments, I tentatively tag them <em>red-black.</em>
    And these models help me to relate to people better on their own terms — to more
    rapidly understand their goals and motivations, to more accurately contextualize
    their actions, and to know which facet of my *own *personality to turn toward
    them.</p><p>In the end, it’s all shorthand, and clear-opinions-lightly-held. Learning
    the color system doesn’t really give me <em>new</em> information — it’s just an
    intuition pump, an extra library imported to my script. But like a good library,
    it gets me places a *lot *faster, and enables a lot more quick function calls
    than doing the whole thing in straight code.</p><p>My last anecdote is about how
    the color wheel broke me out of writer’s block — I’d been stuck at the same point
    in my then-one-quarter-finished novel for almost a year when I came across this
    framework, and I immediately sat down to try to classify all of my characters
    (as MTG game designer Mark Rosewater often does on his <a href="https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/KbaJsfBtdpGv7EKbC/markrosewater.tumblr.com">blog</a>,
    where most of my understanding of this stuff comes from).</p><p>I was surprised
    to discover that, while I had an <em>immediate</em> stereotype about my second-
    and third-most important characters (red and white/blue/black, respectively) I
    had <em>no idea</em> what colors my main character was.</p><p>Thinking about it
    for an hour produced a decision (partly based on previous impressions, and partly
    <em>solidifying</em> and <em>crystallizing</em> those impressions) of green/blue,
    and I was off. I wrote thirty pages over the next two days, not to mention cleaning
    up a <em>bunch</em> of loose and random characterization.</p><p>There are other
    intuition pumps that do similar things for other people. Maybe I could’ve had
    the same breakthrough with word association or rolling dice or throwing darts
    at pictures of Robert Kegan. But of all the toy frameworks I’ve played with in
    my life, this is the one that keeps on giving. If I had to give you one, well
    — I didn’t <em>have</em> to, but this <em>is</em> the one I chose.</p><p><img

    do you see? Do you dream about concurrent odometry or horizontal plane detection?
    Do you fantasize about hot words and utterance capture? Probably not. Most likely,
    when you dream of the future, you imagine the places you can go, the things you
    can do, and the people you can be… just like you did when you were a kid.</p><p><center><iframe

    IDEO to find out what emerging technologies like Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality,
    digital assistant, and ephemeral apps (apps that you don’t have to download and
    install) may actually be good for. With the advent of these new technologies come
    infinite possibilities for their application. In this future, many things are
    possible, but what is useful and desirable? How will people integrate these technologies
    into their lives? When they think of what these technologies can do for them,
    what do they dream of? Where do they want to go? What do they imagine? Google
    was eager to find out.</p><p>Since humans are at the center of IDEO’s design work,
    we started by talking to people and asking questions about their hopes for the
    future of these technologies.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/1*rM73xoDs5G0ycitgQxJgSA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>We spoke to creators and stakeholders of these four technologies
    (experts, artists, and developers), as well as people ranging from elementary
    school kids to early adopters and technophobes. We held in-person conversations
    at IDEO San Francisco and got to know people over snacks and drinks. We had energetic
    and casual discussions — all to get inspired around the future.</p><p>We intentionally
    didn’t discuss specific brands, platforms, or features. Instead, we created design
    exercises that abstracted each of the technologies into something you could hold,
    draw on, imagine, and experience.</p><p>Here are highlights of what we heard:</p><p><center><iframe
    width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2EPtAmfJANQ" frameborder="0"
    allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p><p>Through these research sessions, we identified
    distinct promises each of these emerging technologies can uniquely offer:</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/1*WvUcObRhogt_dWYAFImqjA.png" alt=""></p><p>When
    considering what these technologies are good for, how they can fit into your business,
    or how you can get started with them, it’s easy to just focus on their current
    capabilities or shortcomings and make assumptions about their actual value to
    people. Instead, we should think about what they mean for people by using these
    promises to guide our work.</p><blockquote><h1>If we hope to create something
    of lasting value, we need to start with what people want — not just with what’s
    technically possible.</h1></blockquote><h2>What our research taught us about people’s
    hopes, wants, and dreams</h2><p>To get to what people are thinking and feeling,
    we need to get tangible and expressive. When you present people with a tangible
    concept that still offers room for input, they see potential and are open to sharing
    ideas. When you hand them something too polished, they look for flaws.</p><h3>Virtual

    people different scenes ranging from the mundane — like commuting on the subway,
    to the fantastical — like visiting Mars or flying over a city. We handed them

    also asked: how did you get here? What do you want to do here? Who would you like

    from the most influential geneticist of our time</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4800/1*e2s4UdIRFyi0GPsUKm6-vQ.jpeg"
    alt="Illustrations by [Bijou Karman](http://www.bijoukarman.com/)"><em>Illustrations
    by <a href="http://www.bijoukarman.com/">Bijou Karman</a></em></p><p>For a man
    playing God, George Church certainly looks the part. Over the past 45 years, the
    Harvard geneticist and his bushy white beard have published hundreds of papers
    and earned dozens of patents expanding our ability to read, write, and edit DNA,
    the code of life. He was among the first to apply the gene editing tool CRISPR
    to mammalian cells (he tied with his former postdoc). Church and his eclectic
    lab have pushed bioengineering in multiple directions, showing how it can be used
    to resurrect mammoths, eradicate malaria-carrying mosquitos, produce atmosphere-cleansing
    bacteria, and even detect bits of dark matter pelting us from space. He once stored
    70 billion copies of his book, <em>Regenesis</em>, in a drop of DNA the size of
    a period after translating it into the As, Ts, Cs, and Gs of DNA’s double helix.
    But we wanted to talk with Church about the future of humanity, and to that end,
    he mused on pig organs, dating apps, brains in a dish, and artificial intelligence.
    This conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p><h3><strong>Are
    you hopeful about humanity?</strong></h3><p>*<em>George Church: *</em>If you look
    out into space, so far all we see are dead rocks. I’m very concerned that that’s
    not a great alternative, and we need to do everything we can to preserve our species
    until we get some evidence that there’s something out there that’s as good. It’s
    not even clear that, if we disappeared, the apes or the squids would take our
    place. I guess more to your point, what are my odds that the species will make
    it 100 years? I just have no idea.</p><h3><strong>Lots of people want to extend
    their lifespans. What’s your approach to increasing longevity?</strong></h3><p>There
    are nine pathways, according to review articles. It would be naive to think that
    there is going to be one magic bullet, some simple food or drug or absence of
    food that’s going to do it by itself. One key pathway is the reduction of inflammation.
    There are anti-inflammatory proteins that can be delivered either locally or systemically.
    Another pathway is restoring function in mitochondria, the powerhouses of the
    cell. TFAM is an example of a protein that we’ve shown, if you increase it, you
    get high levels of a small molecule used by mitochondria. And as we age, there’s
    a shortening of telomeres, the DNA protecting the tips of chromosomes. TERT is
    the enzyme that adds base pairs to the end of chromosomes. So if that’s weak as
    you age, then you can add excess. The list goes on and on, and many of these have
    been shown to work in mice. I like the gene therapy approach.</p><blockquote><h1>As
    a technologist, I see things a few years before other biologists do, and certainly
    before the bioethicists do.</h1></blockquote><h3><strong>How do gene therapies
    work, and what else can they be used for?</strong></h3><p>Proteins and genes can
    be delivered intravenously to humans. If a particular protein is missing or damaged,
    you can either put that protein in or you can put the gene that codes for that
    protein in. There are about 2,000 gene therapies in clinical trials. A gene called
    RPE65 makes essential proteins in the retina, and mutations in this gene lead
    to vision loss in a condition called Leber congenital amaurosis, or LCA, but the
    gene can be replaced with gene therapy. There are other things you can do with
    gene therapy and protein therapy that aren’t necessarily fixing some mutation.
    You’ve got a very sophisticated machine, which is a protein, which you can engineer
    to do new things in the body. You can go through the human species and find rare
    individuals who have exceptionally interesting proteins. For example, you can
    find people who are highly exposed to HIV but don’t get AIDS, even without treatment.
    And you can find out why it is they don’t, and you can turn that into either a
    protein or a gene therapy.</p><h3><strong>Another approach to longevity is organ
    transplants for those who need them, but spare human organs are scarce. Where
    are you with modifying the pig genome to grow human-compatible organs?</strong></h3><p>We
    have begun trials in nonhuman primates of organs from engineered pigs. Some people
    say, “Oh, you shouldn’t do enhancement,” but the thing is we do enhancement all
    the time — to some extent, all aging reversal is enhancement. Vaccines are enhancement.
    Even though it’s hard to come up with a strong argument for enhancing a healthy
    human being, a lot can be said for enhancing an organ that’s going into an unhealthy
    human being, because you want that organ to be as good as it can be. You want
    it to be pathogen-resistant; you want it to be cancer-resistant. You might want
    it to be resistant to cryopreservation if you want to store the organ.</p><h3><strong>Have
    you experienced much ethical backlash from people who don’t like the idea of mixing
    species?</strong></h3><p>I’ve found that my worst critic is actually me, so I
    have a lot of backlash from George Church. And part of that is because as a technologist,
    I happen to see things a few years before even other biologists do, and certainly
    before the bioethicists do, so I get first dibs, in a way, on all the ways things
    can go wrong. Some of my colleagues worry that regulations are going to slow things
    down. I have never seen a regulation slow down my research. But I have seen fields
    slowed down by inadequate regulations. For example, there weren’t enough regulations
    in Europe on thalidomide, which caused miscarriages and severe birth defects,
    or in the U.S. on Vioxx, the painkiller that increased the risk of fatal heart
    attacks.</p><p>I’m also pro-discussion of things that are outside the FDA’s purview.
    They’re not responsible for economics and equity, making sure a particular treatment
    is available to all people of the world, for instance. I’ve spent a huge fraction
    of my career trying to bring down the price of technologies. The one that’s most
    dramatic is DNA sequencing. We brought that price down by 10 million-fold over
    the past 14 years, and I’m hoping that this year we’ll bring it down below zero
    dollars. Hopefully we’ll be paying people to get their genome sequenced.</p><h3><strong>You’ve
    said everyone should have their genome sequenced. Why?</strong></h3><p>Everyone
    should have the <em>ability</em> to get sequenced. We could save hundreds of billions
    of dollars, because about 5 percent of all babies are born with very severe genetic
    disorders. They die young, and there’s a lot of pain along the way and a lot of
    money spent.</p><h3><strong>The idea is that people would avoid marrying others
    whose genes would combine with theirs to produce sick babies?</strong></h3><p>The
    same carrier status, yeah. This has already been proven to work for a very small
    number of diseases in a very small population. Tay-Sachs disease, for example,
    was almost completely eliminated by matchmaking. So matchmaking isn’t even FDA
    regulated, and it’s not even medicine, but it’s extremely powerful in its medical
    consequences. And there’s almost no downside of matchmaking. You’re going to lose
    5 percent of the people on your social network that you would otherwise be considering
    as a mate.</p><blockquote><h1>I don’t think CRISPR is such a big deal.</h1></blockquote><h3><strong>Do
    you foresee people adding their genome sequences to dating profiles and setting
    them to automatically filter out genetically incompatible mates?</strong></h3><p>That’s
    totally feasible to do with software. Or you could text someone and say, “Hey,
    the software says we’re compatible. Would you like to go out and get some coffee?”
    It’s a little bit edgy, in the sense that you’re talking about procreating. Kind
    of a funny opening comment for a pre-date.</p><h3><strong>What’s the future of
    sequencing?</strong></h3><p>The next stage will probably be three kinds of sequencing.
    One is the lower-cost version of what we’re doing right now, which is fluorescent
    sequencing. The basic idea is you place your DNA under a microscope and add chemicals
    that attach to A, C, and G, and fluoresce with four distinct colors. A camera
    records which dots are in which order. Second, there’ll be fluorescent in situ
    sequencing, where we can actually see what the name of all the expressed genes
    are and where they’re located in a tissue section.</p><h3><strong>Like augmented
    reality?</strong></h3><p>It could be ordinary, just seeing it on your computer
    screen, but the point is right now we throw away that 3D information by just blasting
    open the cells and randomly distributing their guts on a slide. We could retain
    that information. You’re right, once we have that 3D information, you would need
    a way of visualizing it, and probably that would involve 3D imaging like virtual
    reality or augmented reality.</p><p>And the third one I think is very exciting:
    wearable sequencing, where the device is so small and so fast that it can almost
    keep up with where you are, and it can tell you whether the environment around
    you has allergens or pathogens, and maybe even identify the animals and people
    that are near you.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4000/1*7cJaAhLgx-Uk8QevDI_Nww.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><h3><strong>As for gene editing, you played a big role in the application
    of CRISPR to mammalian cells. Could you briefly explain what it is, and then talk
    about why it’s such a big deal?</strong></h3><p>Well, actually, let me start by
    saying I don’t think CRISPR is such a big deal. I <em>should</em> say it’s a big
    deal because I’ve probably personally profited from it more than anybody else
    on the planet, but there are about eight different ways of doing editing. CRISPR
    is just one of them. It’s a fairly small increment over the previous method, and
    all these other editing techniques still work. CRISPR is maybe a threefold improvement
    over the previous one in certain categories, and it’s worse in other categories.
    But there’s no question that the whole thing is a revolution.</p><h3><strong>How
    many startups are you part of now, and what’s the appeal of working with industry?</strong></h3><p>I’ve
    co-founded about 25 startups, and I’ve advised an additional similar number over
    the years, and some big companies as well. The attraction is that if you invent
    something in the academic ivory tower, you can publish it, but that doesn’t necessarily
    have any impact. A few other groups might read it. But to actually turn an invention
    into a fully debugged product and manufacture it at scale and make sure that it’s
    accompanied by adequate instructions and training, that really requires that you
    get it out of academia and into the real world via companies.</p><h3><strong>Some
    people are disgusted by the idea of messing with nature. For example, they don’t
    want to eat GMOs. Why?</strong></h3><p>In terms of GMOs, we want to draw red lines
    in the sand, but there’s a tendency before we understand things to draw those
    lines with the wrong criteria in mind. For example, I don’t think germline changes
    — changes made to embryos or eggs or sperm-producing cells that are transmitted
    over many generations — are the right place to draw a line. Or recombinant DNA—combining
    genes from different species.</p><p>If you change an A to a T or a C to a G or
    any of those things, that’s so close to what happens in nature that it’s almost
    impossible to tell the difference between a change that occurred due to CRISPR
    from one that occurred due to nature. It seems to me that we should be regulating
    the outcome, not how we get there. To me, I’m scared about GMOs, but I’m scared
    about plants being engineered the way they were throughout the history of agriculture,
    where you introduce thousands of random mutations, any one of which could be an
    allergen. I don’t think random is necessarily good. My experience with randomness
    is it tends to be bad. Engineering gives us a chance to ask whether a change is
    safe and effective.</p><h3><strong>Why is germline engineering the wrong line
    to draw in the sand?</strong></h3><p>You should say, what is it that we don’t
    want to happen in germline? If you have a genetic mutation in your family, the
    standard medical practice is to get an abortion or to use in vitro fertilization.
    Engineering sperm is potentially much safer than engineering embryos or even IVF
    and abortion.</p><h3><strong>You’re turning stem cells into human brain tissue
    in the lab. How far along are you?</strong></h3><p>The largest structures we’ve
    made are on the order of half a billion cells, which is larger than a mouse brain.
    It’s not really a macho size thing yet; it’s just exploiting the ability to get
    flow through capillaries. We can now get most of the major cell types of the brain.
    We can make oligodendrocytes, which wrap the myelin sheath that insulates neural
    connections. We can make endothelial cells, which is really critical, because
    if you don’t have endothelium, you don’t have capillaries. We’re trying to make
    larger, more complex organoids that have good blood flow.</p><h3><strong>And what
    are the applications?</strong></h3><p>There are three applications, in order of
    proximity: One is testing genetic variants. Does any particular mutation cause
    a particular brain dysfunction? We even have an Alzheimer’s model. If you take
    cells from late-onset Alzheimer’s patients and age-matched controls and use them
    to grow brain organoids, you can see how they develop differently. The second
    application is testing new drugs or new therapies. They could be electronic devices;
    they could be gene therapies. And then the third category is transplants.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*iJQsPAJyEaQrb8KA3xoGcg.jpeg" alt=""></p><h3><strong>What
    would be the use of a brain transplant?</strong></h3><p>The main use that’s been
    discussed so far is for Parkinson’s. Dopaminergic neurons die, leading to movement
    and motivational problems, and we’d like to replace them. But they could also
    be for cases of epilepsy. Any part of the brain where you can introduce some structure
    that’s capable of making new connections would be a plus. Another use is regeneration
    across breaks that normally would cause paralysis.</p><h3><strong>Okay, so we’re
    not talking about entire brain transplants. There’s a joke that the only organ
    that’s better to donate than to receive is the brain.</strong></h3><p>No, no,
    no, just pieces.</p><h3><strong>Might people add brain tissue for extra IQ points?</strong></h3><p>For
    it to be used in healthy people, it has to be exceptionally safe. But I could
    imagine that being quite safe.</p><blockquote><h1>I think doing experiments on
    humanlike artificial intelligence would be unethical.</h1></blockquote><h3><strong>Are
    there applications of these brain organoids to artificial intelligence?</strong></h3><p>Oh,
    that’s the fourth category. The human brain is pretty far ahead of any silicon-based
    computing system, except for very specialized tasks like information retrieval
    or math or chess. And we do it at 20 watts of power for the brain, relative to,
    say, 100,000 watts for a computer doing a very specialized task like chess. So,
    we’re ahead both in the energy category and in versatility and out-of-the-box
    thinking. Also, Moore’s law is reaching a plateau, while biotechnology is going
    through super-exponential growth, where it’s improving by factors of 10 per year
    in cost/benefit.</p><h3><strong>Currently, computers have a central processing
    unit (CPU), often accompanied by specialized chips for particular tasks, like
    a graphical processing unit (GPU). Might a computer someday have an NPU, or neural
    processing unit — a bit of brain matter plugged into it?</strong></h3><p>Yeah,
    it could. Hybrid systems, such as humans using smartphones, are very valuable,
    because there are specialized tasks that computers are very good at, like retrieval
    and math. Although even that could change. For example, now there’s a big effort
    to store information in DNA. It’s about a million times higher-density than current
    silicon or other inorganic storage media. That could conceivably in the future
    be something where biological systems could be better than inorganic or even hybrid
    systems.</p><h3><strong>At what size should we think about whether lab brains
    deserve rights?</strong></h3><p>All of these things will at some point be capable
    of all kinds of advanced thinking. I think doing experiments on humanlike artificial
    intelligence would be unethical as well. There’s this growing tendency of computer
    scientists to want to make them general purpose. Even if they’re what we would
    call intellectually challenged, they would have some rights. We may want ways
    of asking them questions, as in a Turing test, but in this case, to make sure
    we’re not doing something that would cause pain or anxiety.</p><h3><strong>Will
    we ever develop into something that calls itself a new species? And could there
    be branching of the species tree?</strong></h3><p>It’s a little hard to predict
    whether we’ll go toward a monoculture or whether we’ll go toward high diversity.
    Even if we go toward high diversity, they could still be interbreedable. You look
    at dogs, for example. Very high diversity, but in principle, any breed of dog
    can mate with any other dog and produce hybrid puppies. My guess is that we will
    go toward greater diversity and yet greater interoperability. I think that’s kind
    of the tendency. We want all of our systems to interoperate. If you look into
    big cities, you’re getting more and more ability to bridge languages, to bridge
    cultures. I think that will also be true for species.</p><h3><strong>Do you think
    your greatest contribution to humanity will be something you’ve done, or something
    you’ve yet to do?</strong></h3><p>Well, I hope it’s something I have yet to do.
    I think I’m just now getting up to speed after 63 years of education. Aging reversal
    is something that will buy me and many of my colleagues a lot more time to make
    many more contributions, so you might consider that a meta-level contribution,
    if we can pull that off. The sort of things we’re doing with brains and new ways
    of computing could again be a meta thing. In other words, if we can think in new
    ways or scale up new forms of intelligence, that would lead to a whole new set
    of enabling technologies.</p>'

    Hitler welcomed by supporters at Nuremberg. Photo: Hulton Archive/Getty Images"><em>Adolf
    Hitler welcomed by supporters at Nuremberg. Photo: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</em></p><p>Carl
    Jung once made the tragically accurate statement that Hitler was akin to the mouthpiece
    of the German people’s collective unconscious.</p><p>It is more common to think
    — as well as nicer to think — that Hitler was simply a madman run amok on Germany
    and that his influence alone spoke for all of Nazism’s crazed, manic, and ruthless
    aspects. “He was evil,” people say, their eyes widened, their heads shaking in
    disbelief, and they leave it at that.</p><p>And while it is certainly true that
    Hitler was an evil man, this cannot account for the whole of the frenzy that swept
    Germany at the time. It conveniently goes unmentioned that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/02/19/emergency-powers-helped-hitlers-rise-germany-has-avoided-them-ever-since/">while
    he wasn’t elected in a direct national vote</a>, Hitler came to power in a constitutional
    manner. A sizable portion of the nation had rallied behind him completely by their
    own accord. Hitler’s Nazi party had long been in the making, first coming into
    the picture shortly after the first World War, but it wasn’t until the 1930s that
    membership really started to climb. Hitler’s vision for Germany was different
    from the looser politics of his predecessors, and it was arresting — undeniably
    galvanizing. The strength of this vision eventually dampened the will of other
    political parties as more and more people fell under the spell of Nazism. That
    said, it is not sufficient to pile all explanations for the rise of Nazism on
    a single, deceased man and to bemoan such a tragedy as a shameful pocket of history
    that simply “cannot be comprehended.”</p><p>I don’t think that’s true at all;
    I think most of us don’t want to understand it because in doing so, we might have
    to face some uncomfortable truths about the dark parts of ourselves and humanity
    at large. (But more on this later.)</p><p>Crippled by the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true-story-reichstag-fire-and-nazis-rise-power-180962240/">aftermath
    of WWI</a>, the Germans were weak and apathetic, societally a bit disbanded. They
    were robbed of the intense fervor of war almost overnight, and what arrived in
    its place was humiliation; a crushing defeat. They were a proud people, and this
    sort of merciless crumpling of their honor bred resentment—resentment that festered
    in the souls of the nation’s individuals.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*WETtFQyAgxJtK8Rc4tMOfQ.jpeg"
    alt="Photo: © Hulton-Deutsch Collection/CORBIS/Corbis/Getty Images"><em>Photo:
    © Hulton-Deutsch Collection/CORBIS/Corbis/Getty Images</em></p><p>Economic ruin
    and chaos only exacerbated that hopelessness. It is important to remember that
    Hitler did not invent, but rather capitalized on, all the nationwide resentment
    that fueled the Nazis gaining power and plowing over Europe in the coming decade(s).
    It is, if you put yourself in their shoes, quite easy to imagine how the German
    people could have become bitter and vengeful when the rest of Europe after WWI
    had gutted the entire country of their savings, their well-being, and their sense
    of national honor.</p><p>Hitler merely channeled those emotions that had been
    brewing under the surface of the mass psyche in an exploitative manner that, as
    we know, led to wretched calamity. If anything, Hitler preyed on what the masses
    wanted rather than using brute force to get people to subscribe to his vision.
    He shrewdly served as a placeholder for national resentment and positioned himself
    as the national voice accordingly — amplifying, coalescing, and clarifying, and
    channeling this resentment into a veritable, formidable movement.</p><p>The Germans
    wanted two things at this crucial juncture in history: They wanted revenge, but
    they also lusted after structure. Structure has long been a particular feature
    of the so-called German identity — historically speaking, order, rigidity, and
    efficiency have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/08/weekinreview/germans-find-order-is-just-their-speed.html">stalwart
    cultural values</a>. Post-war Germany lacked order and was too disillusioned to
    practically and successfully collect their revenge and channel it without the
    help of a fervent, charismatic leader.</p><p>That such an extremist movement arrived
    on the front lines of the German political scene and was allowed to completely
    restructure the nation is telling. The Germans were so eager for a new, robust
    identity that an overwhelming majority essentially sacrificed themselves to the
    Nazi ideal. This ideal was mediated through a variety of organizations (think
    Hitler Youth or the Women’s League, for example). Proper German politics, artistic
    taste, scholarly pursuits, and even child-rearing practices became heavily circumscribed.
    All this to say, the bridge to a new society was narrow. And those that did not
    <a href="https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/go-in-depth/germany-1933-democracy-dictatorship">comport
    with the Nazi ideal</a> weren’t going to make it across that bridge.</p><p>Citizens
    laid down their individual identities at the feet of Hitler, sacrificing themselves
    for the Third Reich’s collective identity. In many cases, their moral consciences
    proved hardly resilient to the repugnant aspects of Nazism and thus, were effortlessly
    overrun. (And that should be a warning to us all.)</p><p>Such is the inherent
    danger of strongly identitarian ideologies, particularly when the people in question
    do not have durable, self-aware identities themselves and a certain moral culpability
    to match.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*9qRTW35XADQz5bEIFFX0kw.jpeg"

    Troopers and SS Men, carrying swastika banners, as 120,000 persons at the tenth
    Nazi party Congress. Photo: Bettmann/Getty Images</em></p><p>Strong undercurrents
    of obedience, duty, and conformity ran through German culture, along with a kind
    of Prussian puritanism. Germans believed in the superior ideals of hardening themselves
    to the world and carrying out duty above all else. Nazism intensified this strict
    and rigid culture, engendering paranoia among the people. Paranoia, it should
    be noted, is an aspect of every totalitarian society because it is a check for
    conformity, a subtle means of control. And thus, in Nazi Germany, individual identity
    was often obliterated both horizontally (via conformity) as well as vertically
    (via the authoritarian call to national duty above all else).</p><p>What is so
    chillingly remarkable about Nazism’s success was that it flipped the conventional
    political script. Instead of espousing promises, like most political figures and
    movements attempt to do, Hitler promulgated demands.</p><blockquote><h1>Imbued
    with a revolutionary and transcendent sense of purpose, they were blind to the
    hijacking of their minds.</h1></blockquote><p>He did not address the public from
    the podium, lavishing them with lofty promises of this or that, so much as he
    called upon the German people to throw themselves into the Nazi effort for the
    sake of their homeland. And they did. <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/03/how-nazi-propaganda-encouraged-the-masses-to-co-produce-a-false-reality.html">It
    was unprecedented, a profound psychological feat</a>. The response he gained from
    the people was fevered and enthusiastic. He spoke to them with religious-style
    charisma, and they gave him their souls!</p><p>The kind of collective demands
    made of the German community in this era must have been very psychologically satiating.
    Indeed, all indications suggest many Germans welcomed this grafting of purpose
    onto their lives with open arms. Imbued with a revolutionary and transcendent
    sense of purpose, they were blind to the hijacking of their minds.</p><p>Hitler
    did not so much have to “win people over” with political schmooze and intellectual
    persuasion. No, he acted as the emotional underbelly of the German people writ
    large. Subsequently, Germany transformed into a veritable Nazi war machine and
    all of daily life became <a href="https://medium.com/lessons-from-history/the-tragic-success-of-nazi-propaganda-8f6a04926592">inundated
    with Nazi politics</a>. Society was absolutely stricken by the power of politics.
    Anything else — moral concerns, original thinking, opposing opinions — had been
    intimidated into hiding.</p><p>What strikes me as a bit haunting about Nazism,
    in particular, is that so much of the nation willingly identified with this extremist
    system that carried out ethically contemptuous deeds. They believed in it exuberantly
    and of their own volition. (Which is to say, not purely out of state coercion,
    as in many other authoritarian systems.)</p><p>What, then, does that tell us about
    the human condition? Perhaps that we are more easily overcome by a vigorous ideology
    that gifts us with purpose than we’d like to think. There are ways to prevent
    this, and grounding yourself strongly in your own moral identity is a significant
    one.</p><p>In applying these revelations to the present, if so many of us feel
    purposeless in our daily lives, are we not more susceptible to this sort of thing?
    Even more so if we’re ineffectual and lackadaisical and don’t have strong personal
    belief systems? A society is in profound danger if the people that constitute
    that society do not have a healthy individuality coupled with a moral identity
    and a vigilant self-awareness.</p><p>And so, here is my somewhat challenging final
    question: Why do you think Nazism happened? How could an entire nation be caught
    up in such a collective frenzy, and how could they do such evil things in good
    conscience? How do they go along with it? The answers lie in confronting the dark
    recesses of the human condition.</p><p>Decades removed from this catastrophe,
    people automatically feel inclined, with a weary sigh and a confused shake of
    their heads, to lament, “I just don’t understand.” It’s as if they’re some exemplar
    of unsullied human morality that fundamentally can’t comprehend the dark, destructive
    impulses that threaded through Nazism 80 years ago. What does that really mean
    — not understanding?</p><blockquote><h1>If you can’t recognize the monstrous part
    hidden inside of you and subsequently tame it, who’s to say you won’t become a
    monster yourself?</h1></blockquote><p>There’s reason to be skeptical of people
    that trot out this line too frequently; it’s very telling if they do. “I don’t
    understand” is not a satisfying answer at all to these quandaries. And it’s not
    even an answer; it’s a nonanswer. It’s a refusal to engage with anything even
    mildly distressing about the catastrophic and evil impulses in humanity.</p><p>Nobody
    wants to believe that if they lived in 1930s Germany they would have been swept
    into the Nazi movement themselves. Nobody wants to entertain that notion! They
    step away from it, they’re taken aback, suddenly their reasoning abilities escape
    them; they cannot coexist with this question, so they throw it out the window
    as oh-so-conveniently indecipherable. (Granted, not all of those in Germany at
    the time did fall under the spell, but the majority did and many eventually joined
    the cause though they at first <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveforbes/2016/03/01/why-they-stuck-with-hitler/#19054b916797">were
    adamantly against it</a>.)</p><p>If you can’t recognize the monstrous potential
    hidden inside of you and subsequently tame it, who’s to say you wouldn’t become
    swept up in such a fray? It’s a perfectly absurd thing, if you think about, to
    hypothetically insinuate that you have no capacity to comprehend the evil things
    mankind has done. Who are you to think you’re immune from that? You’re human,
    so you’re guaranteed to carry some fiber of evil inside of you, and if you can’t
    accept that, who are you, God himself? If you sit still long enough and honestly,
    carefully, think — think, that is, not impulsively judge — I believe you would
    understand. There’s a capacity for evil in everyone and, frankly, an appetite
    as well; the timeline of history itself is already flagrant evidence of this.</p><p>Aleksandr
    Solzhenitsyn famously said, “The line dividing good and evil cuts through the
    heart of every human being.” Though we may not want to face this haunting truth,
    it is reality. And we will do ourselves more damage if we avoid awareness of this
    notion and neglect to recognize this part of ourselves in our private, individual
    minds. Humans have the frightening capability to become very dangerous creatures
    indeed. Better for us to tame that nature individually than to be manipulated
    by someone or something into wreaking havoc on history’s stage.</p>'

  :title: How to Activate Extreme Self-Confidence and Destroy Chronic Anxiety and
    Fear
  :content: '<p>How to Activate Extreme Self-Confidence and Destroy Chronic Anxiety
    and Fear</p><p>When I was growing up, I had virtually no self-confidence.</p><p>A
    chronic stutter had convinced me to keep my mouth shut; better not speak at all
    than speak and get laughed at.</p><p>Heavy pornography usage had eroded my ability
    to connect with people; I would frequently make huge conversational gaffs when
    I’d try to hold a conversation. “<em>Look out, huge butt coming through!</em>”
    I cackled stupidly as a girl I liked walked past me to her seat during a football
    game.</p><p>Do you ever just want to go back in time and…repeatedly smack your
    face with your shoe?</p><p>Most people don’t have high self-confidence. A life
    lived for others and no real effort to improve has left them wildly insecure,
    full of self-doubt and confusion.</p><p>The solution is confidence and self-belief.
    But these aren’t innate gifts, as most people might think. Motivational speaker
    David Schwartz once wrote:</p><blockquote><h1><em>“All confidence is acquired,
    developed. No one is born with confidence. Those people you know who radiate confidence,
    who have conquered worry, have acquired their confidence, every bit of it.”</em></h1></blockquote><p>If
    you want to activate extreme self-confidence and finally eliminate chronic worry
    and anxiety, you need to build it yourself.</p><p>Here’s how.</p><h2>Trade Your
    Mediocre Behaviors For Those of Successful People</h2><blockquote><p>“The key
    to becoming world-class in your endeavors is to build your performance around
    world-class routines.” -Darren Hardy</p></blockquote><p>Most people constantly
    practice mediocre, substandard routines and behaviors.</p><p>There is a distinct
    difference between how successful and unsuccessful people operate. They think,
    speak, and carry themselves very differently.</p><p>Successful people with high
    self-confidence weren’t just born that way — they became that way. NYT Best-Selling
    author Grant Cardone once said, “<em>Success is not something that happens to
    you, it’s something that happens because of you and the actions you take.</em>”</p><p>Success
    and self-confidence must be grown, nurtured, and trained. Anyone from any background,
    regardless of upbringing/social class/ability can cultivate this skill.</p><p>It
    requires deliberate and intentional training, though. Like any skill, it’s grown
    over time. Those who put in the work, get the results.</p><blockquote><h1>To produce
    extraordinary results, you don’t need an unlimited budget; you just need a better
    tool kit.” -Tim Ferriss</h1></blockquote><p>If you want to have the type of confidence,
    focus, and charisma that enables you to achieve your ideal lifestyle, you need
    to model your behavior on others who’ve already succeeded.</p><p>Want 100% financial
    independence? Find a mentor who’s already done it.</p><p>Want to own your business?
    There are dozens of incredible people who teach how to do it online, for free.</p><p>Want
    a strong, healthy body? I think you see where I’m going with this.</p><p>Trade
    in your outdated and unhelpful actions with the actions a successful person would
    do.</p><p>There are people, *right now, *living the life you want. Read their
    stuff. Buy their courses. Follow their instructions.</p><p><strong>If you want
    a different life, you need to do things differently.</strong></p><blockquote><p>“One
    of the greatest turning points in my life occurred when I stopped casually waiting
    for success and started to approach it as a duty, obligation, and responsibility.”
    -Grant Cardone</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/13440/0*U0dCsLdlc7Vsksgf."

    While You Feel Fear</h2><blockquote><p>“Act while you feel fear rather than waiting
    until you feel unafraid.” -David Richo, How to Be An Adult</p></blockquote><p>The
    world’s top salespeople still dread picking up their phone sometimes.</p><p>The
    world’s most accomplished athletes still get nerves before big games. Bill Russell,
    one of the greatest players in NBA history (winner of 11 championships in 13 years)
    often vomited before big games due to nerves and anxiety.</p><p>When asked about
    how he felt when he released a movie, legendary film director Martin Scorcese
    made this remark:</p><blockquote><h1>“If you don’t get physically ill seeing your
    first rough cut, something is wrong.”</h1></blockquote><p>The world’s top performers
    act while they are afraid.</p><p><strong>Don’t wait until the fear is gone. Act
    while you feel fear.</strong></p><p>I remember being in love with this cute girl
    in middle school. I barely spoke a word to her in class. I was terrified of rejection,
    of stuttering over my words if I revealed my feelings.</p><p>On the <em>last</em>
    day of school, I was determined to tell her. I can still remember how profoundly
    terrified I was as I walked up to her group of friends (why are girls always surrounded
    by an army of friends!) and I nervously asked if I could speak with her alone.</p><p>I
    told her I liked her, and asked if she’d be my girlfriend.</p><p>She said yes.
    I think we awkwardly hugged, and that was it.</p><p>The ending isn’t important
    (we didn’t speak to each other all vacation, and then she broke up with me through
    her friends when school started, OK?).</p><p>But if I had waited until I didn’t
    feel afraid? I would have <em>never</em> talked to her. I would have regretted
    it for years.</p><p>Author Mark Manson once joked, “<em>How do you get rid of
    ‘runner’s block?’ You go for a f</em>cking run.*”</p><p>If you’re scared of something,
    the easiest way to gain confidence is, well…just do it.</p><p>There are some <em>phenomenal</em>
    writers and authors out there that we’ve never heard of — they’re too scared to
    publish. As writer <a href="undefined">Jon Westenberg</a> once wrote: <strong><em>“You
    just have to outrun everyone who doesn’t have the guts to publish their work.”</em></strong></p><p>Act
    while you feel fear. Even if you get unceremoniously dumped, you’ll feel better
    and better.</p><h2>Seek Problems, Don’t Avoid Them</h2><blockquote><p>“One of
    the major differences between successful and unsuccessful people is that successful
    people look for problems to resolve, whereas the latter make every attempt to
    avoid them.” -Grant Cardone</p></blockquote><p>What happens when you avoid problems?</p><p>You
    develop a bad reputation for dumping your work onto somebody else. Your personal
    integrity is chipped away. Fear and anxiety begin brewing; “<em>Will this come
    back to haunt me later?</em>” you wonder. Your peace of mind is lost.</p><p>But
    what happens when you decide to seek problems?</p><p>You become someone with the
    sterling reputation of a “problem-solver.” You attract respect and admiration.
    “<em>The world gives to the givers and takes from the takers,</em>” Adam Grant
    wrote in his book, *Give and Take. *You become someone people trust. Help naturally
    flows to problem-solvers — even if you don’t succeed!</p><p>The reason most people
    struggle with self-confidence is because they’ve proven to themselves over and
    over that they “can’t do it.” They’ve tried eating healthier, exercising, being
    more productive, drinking less, but nothing seems to work.</p><p>If you were a
    business, would a customer trust you’d follow through on your word?</p><p>The
    answer is no for more people. To remedy this, you need to start building trust
    in yourself again. Your word must be your bond. If you say you’ll do something,
    that <em>means</em> something.</p><p>So seek problems out. Give yourself some
    reps. Failure doesn’t matter; Seth Godin once said, “If I fail more times than
    you, I win.”</p><p>What matters is the practice. This builds up your self-confidence
    and self-trust.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/11520/0*p_6ci7_R9MpbKAX1."

    People Aren’t Self-Confident — So Don’t Do What Most People Do!</h2><blockquote><p>“When
    they zig, you should zag, and you’ll win every time.” -Ramit Sethi, NYT Best-Selling
    author and entrepreneur</p></blockquote><p>Most people aren’t full of confidence
    or self-belief.</p><p>Quite the opposite, in fact. Most people are insanely insecure.
    They are heavily preoccupied in what others think of them. They act to please
    others, and their primary motivations are “keeping up” and “looking cool.”</p><p>Whenever
    I fall into the rhythms that are common or “popular,” I start to feel that fear
    and anxiety again. Things like:</p><ul><li><p>I need to keep up an image on social
    media</p></li><li><p>I need to make sure I have a cool-enough answer at my high
    school reunion for, “So what have you been up to?”</p></li><li><p>I need a better
    haircut so people will admire me fondly</p></li></ul><p>It’s all a game. None
    of it matters. It only leaves you feeling more insecure.</p><p>So if most people
    are insecure, scared, anxious, and fragile…</p><p><strong>Don’t do what other
    people do!</strong></p><p>“<em>If you keep living like the way you are now, you
    will continue to produce the same life you already have</em>,” wrote prolific
    motivational speaker Jim Rohn. If you want a different life, you need to do things
    differently.</p><p>If you want to eliminate your anxiety and fear, then don’t
    look for answers from what author Hal Elrod calls the “Mediocre Majority.” They’re
    just as lost as you are, even if they’re great at pretending they aren’t.</p><p>When
    most people zig one way, you should zag the other way.</p><p>Choose your role
    models carefully. Those with the loudest voices rarely offer the wisest insights.
    In my years in 12-step programs for recovery, getting a “sponsor” (a guide for
    the difficult path ahead) is crucial. The best advice given to me about choosing
    a sponsor was to just <em>find someone who has what you want.</em></p><p>Do you
    want the same insecure, boisterous, superficial life most people have? Or do you
    want the real thing, full of quiet self-confidence and an inner pride?</p><p>Then
    find someone who has what you want, and ignore the rest.</p><h2>What Doesn’t Add
    to Your Healing Subtracts From It</h2><blockquote><p>“If your lifestyle does not
    add to your healing, it will subtract from it.” -Benjamin Foley</p></blockquote><p>Is
    your lifestyle full of positive, supportive, healing influences?</p><p>Or is it
    full of garbage that drags you down and prevents you from growing?</p><p>Most
    people have several negative influences in their life that are dragging them down.
    “All around you is an environment that is trying to pull you down to Second-Class
    Street,” author David Schwartz once said.</p><p>These influences — environment,
    people, media, behaviors — prevent you from evolving into better versions of yourself.
    It’s your responsibility to cut them from your life.</p><p>If it’s not helping
    you, it’s likely hurting you.</p><blockquote><h1>“You cannot hang around negative
    people and expect a positive result.” -Darren Hardy</h1></blockquote><p>Strangely,
    most people try to fill their life with all sorts of “things” to remove the fear.
    But for the most part, more things means more anxiety. It’s more upkeep, more
    debt, and more things draining your attention.</p><p>As my friend <a href="undefined">Niklas
    Goeke</a> once wrote, “<a href="https://medium.com/personal-growth/minimalism-will-not-make-you-happier-627c83c788e8">minimalism
    will not make you happier.</a>” But less stuff is almost always better.</p><p>I
    gave away most of my clothes. I don’t buy “trinkets” or “doo-dads,” things that
    have no real value. Prolific blogger James Altucher claims he only owns “<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/james-altucher-choose-yourself-author-owns-15-things-2016-8">15
    things</a>,” ensuring his mind is focuses and unencumbered.</p><blockquote><p>“I
    wonder what it is that the more we have, the more we become prisoners at the thought
    of losing it, rather than setting us free.” -Nirmalya Kumar</p></blockquote><p><img

    Conclusion</h2><p>Most people struggle with big levels of anxiety and fear. It’s
    uncommon to see high levels of self-confidence; people notice the person who is
    secure and comfortable in their own skin.</p><p>You can be that person. Even if
    you’re not there yet, start by modeling your behaviors around people who already
    have what you want.</p><p>Act while you still feel the fear; it’s not going away,
    so act anyway. Trust me — you’ll feel better after.</p><p>Seek problems out. Start
    proving to yourself you can handle problems and you won’t back down.</p><p>Remember
    — most people are full of tremendous anxiety and self-doubt; don’t do what most
    people do!</p><p>If you want to activate extreme self-confidence and eliminate
    anxiety and fear, then start living a new life with new behaviors that will make
    that possible.</p><h2>Ready to Level-Up?</h2><p>If you want to become extraordinary

  :title: 4 ways to get high-paying writing work — don’t self-publish.
  :content: '<p>Photo by Art Lasovsky on Unsplash</p><p>Most creatives don’t understand
    one, simple truth:</p><blockquote><h1>Turning what you love into a business involves
    being good at business.</h1></blockquote><p>I write full-time for a living — a
    luxury I enjoy because I’m just as much of a business person as I am a writer.</p><p>While
    I learned <a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-elements-of-style-by-eb-white-william-strunk-jr/249214/?mkwid=s5F8Qd4T0%7cdc&pcrid=70112885352&pkw=&pmt=&plc=&pgrid=21326561472&ptaid=aud-376656233455%3apla-294813786956&gclid=CjwKCAiAy-_iBRAaEiwAYhSlA0Bhq4Nl1GJztND6J4K5s0InbUZravV4C73Axt1kBE-gXkBvD027HRoCuAAQAvD_BwE#isbn=020530902X&idiq=1233221">The
    Elements of Style</a>, I also learned <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Million-Dollar-Consulting-Professionals-Practice/dp/1259588610">Million
    Dollar Consulting</a> (not affiliate links).</p><p>My business acumen said <em>don’t
    listen to the “pros” selling overnight self-publishing success</em>.</p><p>Not
    that I don’t want to self publish — and I’m definitely not condemning it — but,
    without a high number of followers (many thousands) or email subscribers (many
    thousands), self-publishing isn’t likely to earn a livable wage.</p><p>You can
    build a following and email list, and then self-publish profitably. But the likelihood
    that you’ll make money from your first book (immense amount of effort) is extremely
    low.</p><p>Even if you’re a best-seller in some random category no one has ever
    heard of — people don’t search for keywords they’ve never heard of.</p><p>You
    could invest money into ads for your self-published work, but then, you’d likely
    be far in the red before you start to make money. You’d be lucky to break even.</p><p>Or,
    you might write a dynamite book on your first try (highly unlikely) and sell the
    shit out of it without any marketing effort whatsoever (highly unlikely).</p><p>I
    asked myself — <em>would a smart business person gamble all that writing time
    and effort on something so unlikely to pay off?</em></p><h3>A better way to make
    money writing</h3><p>Here are a few mediums I’ve used to generate a significant
    income from my writing. I write or ghostwrite ebooks, blogs, articles, and emails
    for businesses.</p><p>I write for IT/tech companies, but you can choose any niche
    that interests you. I have friends that make money writing for lifestyle companies,
    yoga studios, medical journals, finance firms, law firms, women’s rights orgs,
    etc.</p><p>I was able to build a six-figure writing company with zero professional
    writing experience, zero followers, and zero people on an email list — using the
    tools I’m going to share here.</p><p><strong><em>I have no affiliation with any
    of these tools.</em></strong></p><h2>1. LinkedIn Profinder</h2><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profinder">LinkedIn
    Profinder</a> is one of my favorite tools for finding quality work. You can find
    decent paying gigs with small/medium businesses here. The way it works is that
    you create a profile and enter the type of work you’re looking for (content writing,
    ghostwriting, etc.).</p><p>Then, when companies create proposal requests for those
    types of work, you are notified and can apply to the gig.</p><p>It’s a passive
    medium, meaning, you wait for requests to come to you.</p><h3>Money I made from

  :title: Struggle With Self-Discipline? Try Forming These Habits
  :content: '<p>Without discipline, we give up easily</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4096/1*ttO7mV012zJmWraAsjK6Bg.png"
    alt=""></p><p>Self-discipline is the ability to make yourself do things even if
    you <em>don’t</em> want to do them. That’s one of the most important qualities
    in life.</p><p>Especially in 2020, since we’re all forced to work and spend more
    time at home. There’s not much we can do outside of the house. That requires self-discipline.
    <em>A lot</em> of discipline.</p><p>We can’t travel, eat out, shop comfortably,
    watch movies at the cinema, go to concerts, and so forth. And yet, we’re expected
    to behave like good people. We’re expected to work remotely, stay in shape, participate
    in video calls, take online courses, keep in touch with family, you name it.</p><p>Without
    self-discipline, we will revert back to giving up. Because whether you’re aware
    of it or not, we’re all headed towards chaos. That’s the natural direction of
    life.</p><p>We need self-discipline to fight back. But how do you develop it?
    It remains a complex issue, and no one has the answers. Jocko Willink simply says
    that you must do things and <a href="https://dariusforoux.com/good/">not complain.</a>
    I like that, but for us mortals, it’s not that simple.</p><p>One thing I know
    is that it doesn’t happen overnight. I prefer to focus on habits that lead to
    discipline, instead of focusing on self-discipline itself. So here’s a list of
    habits I’ve adopted that made me more disciplined.</p><h2>Hold yourself accountable</h2><p>If
    you say you’re going to do something, <em>do it</em>. And if you can’t, have a
    good reason. That’s the foundation of self-discipline. But you don’t do things
    so you can prove something to <em>others</em>.</p><p>No, you do it for yourself.
    You hold yourself accountable by writing down your goals, intentions, and actions.
    No one is watching. Just be yourself.</p><p>This doesn’t have to be complicated.
    I write down what I want to do every single day in my journal. Then, at the end
    of the day, I look at what I actually did. When your actions match your words,
    you’re on the right track.</p><h2>Be honest in your communication</h2><p>To yourself
    and to others. Honesty is difficult for most of us because it requires humility.
    We’re often afraid of <a href="https://dariusforoux.com/3-steps-to-personal-freedom/">telling
    the truth</a> because we think we look weak.</p><p>But the opposite is true. When
    you’re not honest, people can tell. As a result, no one will take you seriously.
    We all have weaknesses and issues. There’s no need to hide it. There’s also no
    need to play the victim. Simply stick to the truth.</p><p>When you keep on being
    honest with yourself and others, it’s easier to be disciplined. Because it’s not
    the end of the world when we screw up. I have bad days too. I eat junk food. I
    skip my workouts. But I’m honest about it when I do. That brings me back on the
    right path.</p><h2>Set the right example</h2><p>Never expect people to do something
    you’re not doing. And if you’re doing something others are not doing, don’t expect
    them to do it.</p><p>“What’s that?” I know. It sounds like a paradox. It comes
    down to this: Do the right thing and have zero expectations of others. If some
    people don’t want to do that themselves, it’s not your problem. Keep on setting
    the right example. This is one of the biggest cliches in the world, but let your
    actions speak for you.</p><h2>Improve every day</h2><p>Most people don’t have
    the patience and drive to improve. Recently, a person who bought my writing course
    said it was too much work to improve their writing. No kidding?!</p><p>Of course
    it’s hard to improve yourself. That’s why most people don’t do it. I gave that
    person a refund. It’s not for you. There are enough people who <em>do</em> want
    to improve themselves. If you have the will to improve, you don’t have to worry
    about self-discipline.</p><p>But you need to have a reason to improve. Why do
    you want to get better at a skill? What do you want to use it for? Why do you
    want to get in shape? What will you do when you’re fitter?</p><h2>Think on paper</h2><p>Putting
    your thoughts into words helps you to understand yourself and what you’re doing.
    I often come up with an idea that sounds great in my head.</p><p>But then I put
    my idea into words. I start thinking on paper. I simply write down my thought
    process. I start like this: “I have a new idea. It’s…” By the end of the page,
    I know whether it’s useless or not. Often, my behavior is not a matter of self-discipline
    — or a lack of it.</p><p>Sometimes you don’t do something because it’s not the
    right thing to do. So always think on paper. After you’ve scribbled down your
    thoughts, let it rest, and get back to it a few days later.</p><p>Then, you think
    “this is great” or “this is stupid”. Either way, you win. Why? You used your brain
    as a tool.</p><h2>Do what you can</h2><p>Look, life is far from perfect. We will
    never have the perfect circumstances to work. You know, I wish I lived in a mansion
    on the beach. I wish it never rained when I want to go outside. I wish, I wish,
    I wish. It’s all fun and games. But in life, we must do what we can with what
    we have.</p><ul><li><p>Tired? Do what you can.</p></li><li><p>Fired? Do what you
    can.</p></li><li><p>Got to pay your bills? Do what you can.</p></li><li><p>Shitty
    house? Do what you can.</p></li><li><p>No friends? Do what you can.</p></li></ul><p>(Fill
    in your excuse)? <em>Do what you can</em>. <a href="https://dariusforoux.com/good/">Complaining
    is for losers</a> who have <em>zero</em> self-discipline.</p><h2>Look ahead, very
    far ahead</h2><p>It will not always remain summer. Life moves in cycles. Sometimes
    it’s great for a long time. And sometimes it’s bad for a long time. Things happen.
    Economies collapse. Jobs disappear. Natural disasters happen. Pandemics shut down
    life. You name it.</p><p>The best way to deal with all of it is to be prepared.
    Train your body and your mind. Build a cash buffer. <a href="https://dariusforoux.com/financial-and-emotional-freedom/">Get
    rid of excess</a>. Life is very long.</p><h2>Live NOW</h2><p>But none of the above
    means you should <em>always</em> think about the future. Life happens NOW.</p><p>Working
    from home, reading a book, going for a walk, spending time with loved ones; all
    those things happen right now. You’re not helping yourself by being lost in your
    thoughts.</p><p>You only help yourself by being disciplined about living in the
    present. I remind myself of this several times a day.</p><p>Did you know that
    living in the present is a <em>skill</em>? <a href="https://amazon.com/dp/B077NJWFR3">You’ve
    acquired it once you’re aware of your thoughts</a>. That’s all. So next time you’re
    preoccupied, clenching your jaw, and not paying attention to what’s in front of
    you, snap out of it. “Just like that?”</p><p>Yes, just like <em>that</em>. Get
    back to what matters most: The one thing that’s right in front of you.</p><p><em>This

    from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-holding-disposable-cup-2930722/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pexels">Pexels</a></em></p><p>In
    <a href="https://tim.blog/2020/02/06/brene-brown-striving-self-acceptance-saving-marriages/">a
    recent podcast interview</a> with Tim Ferris, Brene Brown made a fascinating claim:
    <strong>The reason there’s so much hate and unhappiness in the world is because
    people lack self-awareness.</strong></p><p>It’s a bold statement, but the reasoning
    behind it is solid:</p><ul><li><p>We all experience pains and traumas of one kind
    or another as children, leaving us vulnerable and afraid.</p></li><li><p>To protect
    ourselves, we develop ‘emotional armor’ in the form of psychological defense mechanisms.
    We use sarcasm, for example, to avoid being vulnerable.</p></li><li><p>Even though
    these defense mechanisms may have been useful at a young age, by the time we reach
    adulthood, their side effects are seriously sabotaging our lives in the form of
    broken relationships, addictions, narcissism, and even violence.</p></li><li><p>These
    unhelpful behaviors persist and grow because we don’t see them. And so we plod
    along in a daze of unhappy denial, continuing to make ourselves and the people
    around us miserable.</p></li></ul><p>Even if you were fortunate enough not to
    have suffered any major traumas as a child, <strong>everybody has vulnerabilities,
    insecurities, and emotional blindspots.</strong> And at a certain point, it’s
    impossible to grow into higher levels of happiness and success if those insecurities
    — and the defense mechanisms resulting from them — go unaddressed.</p><p>As Tim
    Ferris said in his interview with Brene: *You’re going to suffer either way. The
    only question is whether you do it in the darkness or in the light. *While facing
    up to the bright light of self-awareness isn’t easy, it’s possible for anyone.
    Because…</p><blockquote><h1><em>Fundamentally, self-awareness isn’t a trait you’re
    born with; it’s a set of habits you can learn to cultivate.</em></h1></blockquote><p>In
    my work as a psychologist, I get to see the full spectrum of self-awareness —
    from primitive denial to hard-earned <a href="https://nickwignall.com/self-reflection/">self-reflection</a>
    and wisdom. And among those who have achieved a high level of self-awareness,
    I’ve observed a handful of common habits and practices.</p><p>In the rest of this
    article, we’ll look at these 5 habits of highly self-aware people and learn how
    we can cultivate them in our own lives. Whether your goal is to achieve a little
    more happiness and peace of mind in your life or bolster your performance and
    effectiveness in your work, improving your self-awareness is key.</p><h2>1. They
    listen more than they talk.</h2><p>When it comes to self-awareness, you can’t
    simply think your way into it.</p><p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with deliberate
    self-reflection. In fact, it probably <em>will</em> facilitate self-awareness
    to a degree. But it won’t be *sufficient *for building self-awareness because
    we’re social creatures who learn primarily through each other.</p><p>From babbling
    out our first words as toddlers to graduating from college, most of our learning
    happens socially — toddlers imitate their parents just as students imitate their
    mentors and advisors. Even the notion of the solitary sage, alone in a tower studying
    dusty tomes is actually highly social — books are other people’s voices and ideas
    made permanent!</p><blockquote><h1><em>The quest for self-knowledge is a fundamentally
    social endeavor.</em></h1></blockquote><p>But simply being around other people
    won’t do the trick. True self-awareness comes from genuine interaction with other
    people, from conversation. But to get there you need to be able to listen. To*
    really* listen. And real listening can be a surprisingly difficult thing to do.</p><p><strong>The
    key to gaining meaningful self-awareness through listening is to manage your own
    thoughts during a conversation.</strong></p><p>It’s hard to truly listen when
    you’re formulating your own ideas and only halfway paying attention to theirs.
    Which means <a href="https://nickwignall.com/good-listener/">building the habit
    of being a good listener</a> is mostly about learning to undo unhelpful habits.</p><p>Practice
    letting go of your own narcissistic impulses and cultivating curiosity instead.
    Ironically, by bending your attention outward, you’re far more likely to stumble
    on something useful about yourself.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Most people do not
    listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.</em></h1><h1><em>―
    Stephen R. Covey</em></h1></blockquote><h2>2. They’re curious about their own
    minds.</h2><p>Self-aware people have a habit of thinking about their own patterns
    of thought.</p><p>Just like a good scientist is curious about the world and lets
    their natural curiosity and observations guide later theorizing and experimentation,
    self-aware people have a curiosity about their own minds and inner world. For
    example:</p><ul><li><p>They find it curious that guilt was the first emotion they
    experienced after getting cut off on the freeway rather than anger or fear.</p></li><li><p>They
    notice a pattern of pessimistic thinking in certain contexts and optimism in others.</p></li><li><p>They
    wonder about the overarching beliefs that motivate their behaviors.</p></li></ul><p>Now,
    before you rush to assume that maybe some people are just more curious and self-reflective,
    while others are more outward focused and practical, let me tell you a little
    bit about my work as a therapist…</p><p><strong>My entire job description basically
    comes down to helping people become more curious about their inner lives.</strong>
    Because when you’re curious you begin to see patterns, and when you see patterns
    you begin to understand, and once you really understand, only then is it possible
    to build lasting change.</p><p>Of course, some people do walk into my office with
    higher and lower levels of baseline self-curiosity. But most of them don’t have
    a ton of it. And yet, we’re still able to make good progress because curiosity
    about oneself is something that can be built with time and practice.</p><p>The
    trick to cultivating self-curiosity is to realize that we’re all naturally curious
    — including about ourselves — but for many people, that innate curiosity has been
    suppressed by a competing <a href="https://nickwignall.com/negative-self-talk/">habit
    of self-criticism</a>.</p><blockquote><h1><em>It’s hard to be curious about yourself
    when you’re constantly judging yourself.</em></h1></blockquote><p>If you want
    to alleviate the overly-judgmental attitude toward your own mind and allow your
    natural curiosity to rise up, practice being more gentle with yourself. Watch
    your habits of self-talk and practice <a href="https://nickwignall.com/cognitive-restructuring/">re-framing
    the way you talk to yourself</a> in gentler, more compassionate terms.</p><p>This
    doesn’t mean becoming irrationally positive and naive. It’s about being realistic
    and kind to yourself. It’s about treating yourself the same way you would treat
    a good friend: with gentleness and honesty.</p><p><a href="https://nickwignall.com/negative-thoughts-self-compassion/">Cultivate
    gentler self-talk</a> and you’ll make space for your natural curiosity to take
    root. And greater self-awareness won’t be far behind.</p><blockquote><h1><em>The
    mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.</em></h1><h1><em>―
    Plutarch</em></h1></blockquote><h2>3. They look for emotional blindspots.</h2><p>We
    all have emotional blindspots — parts of our emotional lives that, because they’re
    especially painful, we tend to ignore. Often, we’ve been ignoring them for so
    long that we don’t even know they’re blind spots.</p><p>Here’s an example:</p><p>I
    had a client once, we’ll call James. <strong>James came to see me because he was
    getting into a lot of conflict at work but he didn’t know why.</strong> He knew
    that things were tense at work and often people seemed to not want to work with
    him, but he wasn’t aware of any obvious reason.</p><p>In our first session, James
    told me (half sarcastically) that his boss had told him to be sure and mention
    is “passive-aggressive streak.” I asked James what he thought of that and he simply
    shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>Over the next few meetings, it became clear to me
    that James was experiencing a lot of anger and frustration at work. But interestingly,
    he wasn’t very aware of it. He acknowledged getting “annoyed” from time to time,
    but he never once even used the word “angry” to describe himself at work — even
    though he was often describing a situation where almost anyone would probably
    acknowledge being angry.</p><p>I also learned that <strong>growing up James had
    an alcoholic father who used to rage and be violent when he was drinking.</strong>
    After a few difficult conversations on the topic, James began to see that, because
    he was afraid of turning out like his dad, he had built up the habit of burying
    his anger — sometimes with sarcasm and humor, sometimes with distractions, and
    often by simply calling it by a different name like “stress” or “annoyed,” a common
    issue called <a href="https://nickwignall.com/intellectualized-emotions/">intellectualized
    emotion</a>.</p><p>To his credit, once James realized this connection — that avoiding
    anger was a leftover coping mechanism from childhood that was seriously impacting
    his life — he began making major changes. Most importantly, he acknowledged anger
    as an emotional blindspot and began proactively looking for it. For example, anytime
    he caught himself describing how he felt as “annoyed” or “stressed,” he used that
    as a cue to ask whether there wasn’t really <a href="https://nickwignall.com/secret-life-of-anger/">some
    stronger anger</a> behind those descriptions.</p><p>Not only did this help James
    work out a lot of his issues on the job, but he reported with much pride and enthusiasm
    how it had helped in all sorts of other areas of his life. In particular, he described
    how the habit of looking for emotional blindspots had helped him realize that
    he was also, to a lesser extent, avoiding anxiety in his relationship with his
    wife.</p><p>Whenever he felt anxious in the relationship, he had a habit of withdrawing
    and becoming distant, which was slowly taking a toll on his marriage. But his
    newfound habit of looking for emotional blindspots lead him to this and he was
    able to work through it pretty quickly, the result being a surge in intimacy and
    satisfaction in his marriage.</p><p><strong>It can be scary to even acknowledge
    that you have emotional blind spots, much less have the courage to face up to
    them and investigate them.</strong> But the self-awareness and ultimately freedom
    that comes from doing so can be life-changing.</p><blockquote><h1>Who looks outside,
    dreams; who looks inside, awakes.</h1><h1><em>― Carl Jung</em></h1></blockquote><h2>4.
    They ask for feedback (and take it well).</h2><p>People who are genuinely self-aware
    have the humility to understand that they can’t always see themselves objectively.
    And that often the best way to be more objective about yourself is through the
    lens of other people.</p><p>The trick here is that there is no trick: <strong>If
    you want to see yourself through other people’s eyes you must ask.</strong> It’s
    that simple.</p><ul><li><p>Are you frequently getting into conflict at work? Identify
    a co-worker whom you respect and ask for their honest opinion about the situation.</p></li><li><p>Does
    your spouse keep telling you that you don’t listen? Ask some else in your life
    you’re close to (parent, best friend, mentor) whether you can come across as not
    listening well.</p></li><li><p>Or maybe the situation is more general: Maybe you
    just feel a little dissatisfied with your life and suspect that it has something
    to do with you but you can’t put your finger on it. Again, look for someone in
    your life who knows you well whom you respect and ask them if they see any patterns
    or tendencies that could be a cause.</p></li></ul><p>What gets in the way of most
    of us asking for good feedback is that we’re afraid of getting uncomfortable news:
    We’re afraid to hear that we’re not as good a salesman (or lover) as we think.</p><blockquote><h1><em>Asking
    for feedback isn’t rocket science. But it is scary.</em></h1></blockquote><p>The
    most direct way through this fear is to ask yourself straight-up: <em>Would I
    rather have a small but forceful blast of criticism now or years and decades of
    nagging self-doubt and underhanded criticism that comes from avoiding facing my
    shortcomings?</em></p><p>But even if you steel yourself and decide to ask for
    honest feedback, you have to be ready to take it well. And <strong>taking feedback
    well means managing your defensiveness.</strong></p><p>No matter how self-aware
    or <a href="https://nickwignall.com/emotionally-mature/">emotionally mature</a>
    you think you are, getting criticism always hurts. And anytime we get hurt — physically
    or emotionally — we tend to do one of two things: fight or flee. Either we try
    to overwhelm our own painful feeling by making the other person look bad (fight)
    or we dismiss their feedback out of hand as invalid (flee).</p><p>In either case,
    we’re doing ourselves a double disservice:</p><ol><li><p>You’re not really thinking
    about and absorbing the feedback. And if you’re not doing that, well, what’s the
    point!</p></li><li><p>When you get defensive, you teach other people that you
    can’t take criticism well. This means that in the future when there’s a piece
    of feedback you really need, people in your life are more likely to either withhold
    that feedback or lie and say something to make you feel better because they’re
    afraid of you getting defensive.</p></li></ol><p>To sum up, <strong>one of the
    best ways to learn more about yourself and improve self-awareness is to get objective
    feedback from other people.</strong> But in order to do this, you must be willing
    to tolerate the discomfort of receiving criticism and work to avoid defensiveness
    at all costs.</p><blockquote><h1><em>You can’t achieve excellence in life if you
    fear opinion.</em></h1><h1><em>― Janna Cachola</em></h1></blockquote><h2>5. They
    reflect on their values.</h2><p>Highly self-aware people have a habit of regularly
    reflecting on and considering their values. While they’re always trying to be
    aware of what they might be unconsciously <em>avoiding</em>, they’re also striving
    to be clear about what they <em>want to move toward</em>. But this can be surprisingly
    difficult…</p><p>For one thing, it’s easy to move toward things that look and
    feel important or valuable but may not be, perhaps because the tradeoffs would
    be too great:</p><ul><li><p>Chasing the next promotion or salary bump at work,
    even though it means spending even less time with your family and friends.</p></li><li><p>Enrolling
    in grad school (and taking out another $80K in student loans) because you’re not
    sure what else to do and your parents will be impressed because, hey, more education!</p></li><li><p>Buying
    that new iPhone because it’s awesome and surely it will make you more productive
    even though you’re not saving for retirement at all.</p></li></ul><p>The point
    is, <strong>the line between genuine values and false values can be surprisingly
    thin.</strong> And even if it is clear, the gravity of immediate wants and desires
    is often far stronger than that of long-term values and aspirations. All of which
    means…</p><blockquote><h1><em>It’s essential to regularly clarify what we’re really
    chasing after in life.</em></h1></blockquote><p>I had a client once who, in order
    to make sure her marriage was healthy and going in the right direction, created
    a little ritual with her husband:</p><p><em>Each year on their anniversary, they
    went out to a nice dinner and checked in with each other about A) what they thought
    was going really well in their relationship, B) what they thought needed work,
    and C) what their dreams together were.</em></p><p>It’s a great example of a small
    but powerful habit that increases self-awareness about values and has a real,
    measurable impact on quality of life.</p><p>If this whole discussion of reflecting
    on your values sounds lofty and complex and maybe a little intimidating, start
    with a bucket list. Set aside half an hour some Saturday morning and sit down
    with a nice cup of coffee or tea, a pen, and a blank sheet of paper. And just
    start jotting down things you’d love to accomplish or learn or do or generally
    dream about.</p><p>This is a great exercise to prime the pump on values clarification
    and get you thinking more about what’s really important to you in life. In fact,
    just being aware of your values and reflecting on them from time to time is a
    huge step toward realizing them.</p><blockquote><h1><em>The greater danger for
    most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting
    our aim too low, and achieving our mark.</em></h1><h1><em>― Michelangelo Buonarroti</em></h1></blockquote><h2>All
    you need to know</h2><p>Lasting happiness and success require self-awareness.
    If you aren’t aware of the emotional baggage and blind spots holding you back,
    how can you hope to achieve your potential?</p><p>Thankfully, self-awareness is
    a skill that can be cultivated with practice and good habits:</p><p>Listen more
    than you talk.</p><p>Be curious about your own mind.</p><p>Look for your emotional
    blind spots.</p><p>Ask for feedback frequently (and take it well).</p><p>Take
    time to reflect on your values.</p><p><a href="https://nickwignall.com/newsletter/">**Join

  :title: Why Successful People Choose Self-Compassion Over Self-Esteem
  :content: '<p>Self-compassion isn’t about letting yourself off the hook. It’s about
    having a growth mindset that gives you authentic confidence.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*RQaEvu_FycpP_LQ2LbsGCA.jpeg"
    alt="Credit: Artem Bali via Pexels ([link](https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-wearing-green-sunglasses-749156/))"><em>Credit:
    Artem Bali via Pexels (<a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-wearing-green-sunglasses-749156/">link</a>)</em></p><p>For
    the past six years, I’ve been obsessed with the topic of confidence — how to get
    it, how to raise it, and how to keep it. My preoccupation grew out of fierce battles
    with insecurity while growing up, and out of learning to navigate life as a <a
    href="https://medium.com/s/story/the-secret-life-of-a-highly-sensitive-person-e5e49ab4918b">highly
    sensitive person</a> who feels everything more intensely.</p><p>My obsession really
    took hold when I noticed a strikingly similar pattern among my coaching clients.
    Smart and highly accomplished people, they also had thoughts like:</p><blockquote><h1>“I’m
    falling behind in my career.”</h1><h1>“No matter how much I do, it’s never enough.”</h1><h1>“I
    want to start a business, but I fear looking foolish.”</h1></blockquote><p>Anyone
    who has tried to embark on a professional or personal goal is familiar with this
    voice of the inner critic — the one that says things like “you’re not good enough,”
    “this is a stupid idea,” or “nothing will ever work out.”</p><p>Common advice
    tells us to push these concerns away. We’re encouraged to keep hustling, try harder,
    and do better. If you’re like me, that voice is also cautionary. It says if you
    stop pushing to achieve more, you’ll lose your edge, your status, your income,
    and more. Cue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion">catastrophic
    thinking</a>!</p><p>It’s hard to quiet that voice because it speaks <em>some</em>
    truth. Failing to work on your weaknesses leads to blind spots at best and <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">delusional
    overconfidence</a> on the opposite extreme. There’s also nothing wrong with wanting
    to be confident and ambitious.</p><p>Problems arise, however, when we try to achieve
    happiness solely by raising our self-esteem, which can be fragile. Too often,
    this approach leads to needless suffering and self-criticism.</p><p>The good news
    it that it’s possible to be driven <em>and</em> find inner peace. <strong>You
    do this by cultivating <em>self-compassion</em> instead of striving after higher
    <em>self-esteem</em>.</strong></p><h2>Why Self-Esteem is Not the Key to Confidence</h2><p>Self-esteem
    is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem">defined as</a> your feelings
    about yourself (positive or negative), as well as how you think other people value
    you and feel towards you. In other words, you’re influenced by how you think the
    outside world sees you.</p><p>In order to keep your self-esteem high, you must
    look around and size up your progress versus your peers. These constant comparisons
    trigger stress. The body’s natural fight-or-flight response <a href="http://self-compassion.org/the-physiology-of-self-compassion/">kicks
    in</a>, just as if we we’re being attacked — only it’s all in our head (and our
    heart).</p><p>High-achievers have even more at stake. If you have achieved some
    success, <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-cognitive-dissonance-2795012">you
    must work to maintain an image</a> of being competent and effective. This is a
    precarious position. You may perceive any mistake, setback, or flaw as a failure,
    rather than a natural consequence of growth. If you become overly dependent on
    achievement, approval, or praise, your self-esteem can becomes fragile, as if
    it’s a roller-coaster going up and down in response to external circumstances.</p><p>Many
    people try to motivate themselves to be more confident by judging themselves harshly
    (<em>I *</em>need** to be doing better. I <strong>should</strong> be further along
    by now*). If you hold yourself to exacting standards, your negative self-talk
    may be particularly vitriolic. For example, all through my academic years, I can
    remember berating myself for “only getting an A” and telling myself “you should’ve
    earned an A+”. Many top students share this struggle: going on to achieve great
    things, yet facing internal battles. Psychologists call this “<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/duck_syndrome/article.htm">Duck
    Syndrome</a>”—the appearance of being placid, but with hidden flailing underwater
    to stay afloat. Your accomplishments look good on the outside, but inside there’s
    turmoil.</p><p>Using self-criticism as a motivator is usually ingrained at a young
    age, whether through the school system, societal messages about success, or even
    by <a href="https://melodywilding.com/how-to-overcome-impostor-syndrome/">growing
    up in a home with demanding caregivers</a>. But negative self-talk is not an effective
    way to motivate yourself.</p><p>In her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Willpower-Instinct-Self-Control-Works-Matters/dp/1583335080/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=mewilm-20&linkId=59db08bdf9327c91f8181e0fbd4b93fd">*The
    Willpower Instinct</a><em>, Stanford professor Kelly McGonigal summarizes the
    findings, saying that *</em>“study after study shows that self-criticism is consistently
    associated with less motivation and worse self-control.”** In fact, it shifts
    the brain into <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19770047">a state
    of inhibition</a>, which prevents us from taking action to reach our goals.</p><p>Research
    also suggests that self-esteem may not be the confidence-boosting panacea it’s
    always been cracked up to be. Following the “self-esteem movement” of the 1980’s
    and 1990’s, a sweeping meta-analysis <a href="http://assets.csom.umn.edu/assets/71496.pdf">concluded
    </a>that there was no proof of high self-esteem improving academic achievement,
    job success, or health outcomes.</p><p>After observing these downsides of self-esteem
    and self-criticism, psychologists set out in search of a better solution. Now
    a growing body of research points toward <em>self-compassion</em> as a path to
    resiliency and emotional strength.</p><h2>What is self-compassion?</h2><p>Recall
    a time when you encouraged a friend, coached a co-worker, or soothed a child.
    It’s likely that you felt empathy for the person — not pity — and tried to acknowledge
    that life is messy, imperfect, and sometimes filled with pain. Self-compassion
    involves applying this sense of warm, positive regard towards yourself.</p><p>Dr.
    Kristin Neff is an associate professor at the University of Texas Austin, and
    the foremost researcher on self-compassion. She defines the concept <a href="http://self-compassion.org/the-three-elements-of-self-compassion-2/">this
    way</a>:</p><blockquote><h1><strong>Instead of mercilessly judging and criticizing
    yourself for various inadequacies or shortcomings, self-compassion means you are
    kind and understanding when confronted with personal failings — after all, who
    ever said you were supposed to be perfect?</strong></h1></blockquote><p>Self-compassion,
    as defined by Neff, has three key components:</p><ul><li><p>*<em>Self-kindness
    *</em>— being supportive of yourself; treating yourself as you would a family
    member or friend.</p></li><li><p><strong>Common humanity</strong>—an antidote
    for isolation; understanding that everyone makes mistakes and you’re not alone;
    recognizing that suffering is a universal experience.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mindfulness</strong>—observing
    your thoughts and emotions with nonjudgmental awareness; being present in the
    moment even when negative feelings arise.</p></li></ul><p>While self-esteem is
    fixated on how you feel about yourself positively or negatively, self-compassion
    is about having understanding for wherever you’re at right now and embracing a
    full range of thoughts, emotions, and reactions — without judging them as right
    or wrong. It’s about recognizing that your inner voice is trying to protect you,
    and shifting your self-talk to be benevolent, not punishing.</p><p>Why build skills
    for greater self-compassion? Simply put, because it works. Self-compassion gives
    you greater confidence, makes you more resilient, and fosters authentic growth
    in your abilities.</p><h2>The Benefits of Self-Compassion</h2><p>Self-compassion
    <a href="http://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Self-Criticism.pdf">is
    associated with</a> a number of mental health and performance-enhancing benefits,
    including:</p><ul><li><p>Lower levels of depression, anxiety, and rumination.</p></li><li><p>Greater
    ability to cope with negative emotions.</p></li><li><p>More positive emotions
    like happiness, wisdom, and connectedness.</p></li><li><p>Increased optimism.</p></li><li><p>Showing
    more personal initiative.</p></li></ul><p>High-achievers, take note of this final
    point: self-compassionate people are <em>more likely</em> to take action and reach
    their goals. In particular, <a href="http://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Dunne-et-al_2016.pdf">research
    shows</a> that inducing self-compassion helps people stick to a diet, stop smoking,
    and find intrinsic motivation to exercise for fun.</p><p>The biggest misconception
    about self-compassion is that it undermines motivation. When first introduced
    to the concept, many people fear that being kinder and gentler to themselves will
    make them lazy. They fear losing their ambitious drive and competitive edge. The
    opposite is true. Self-compassion is strongly <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/the_five_myths_of_self_compassion">associated
    with emotional resilience</a>. Self-compassionate people fear failure less, and
    when they do face setbacks, they are more likely to try again.</p><h2>How to develop
    more self-compassion</h2><p>Interested to see how self-compassionate you are?
    You can take an evidence-based assessment <a href="http://self-compassion.org/test-how-self-compassionate-you-are/">on
    Neff’s website here</a>.</p><p>No matter where you fall on the spectrum, we could
    all stand to be kinder to ourselves sometimes. Here are some science-backed ways
    to boost your self-compassion today:</p><h3>Watch your words</h3><p>For the next
    week, take notice of how often you use words like <em>always</em>, <em>should</em>,
    and <em>never</em>—often indicators of self-criticism. Raising your mindful awareness
    is the first step towards cultivating a more balanced internal dialogue. Changing
    your negative self-talk to be friendlier is a <a href="http://self-compassion.org/exercise-5-changing-critical-self-talk/">core
    skill</a> of self-compassion and can help <a href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2017/talking-to-yourself-in-the-third-person-can-help-you-control-stressful-emotions/">control
    stressful emotions</a>.</p><h3>Try a re-do</h3><p>Take an example of a recent
    situation in which you beat yourself up. Examples might be sending an email to
    the wrong person or botching a work matter. Consider how a self-compassionate
    response would differ. This is a form of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3278301/">cognitive
    reappraisal</a>. What would you say to a friend or family member who made the
    same mistake?</p><h3>Write a letter to yourself</h3><p>One <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15298868.2013.840332#.U_J8W7xdWnA">study</a>
    found that adults who wrote a <a href="https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/self_compassionate_letter">compassionate
    letter</a> to themselves for one week experienced significantly less distress
    and large increases in happiness for six months. To write a ‘compassionate letter’,
    take something you are unhappy about with yourself, and express acceptance, understanding,
    and encouragement for yourself about it. You might pretend that you’re someone
    who loves you unconditionally—what would they say to you?</p><p>If journaling
    is not your thing, you could also use a tool like <a href="https://www.futureme.org/">FutureSelf</a>
    to practice processing your hopes, dreams, and fears in a more compassionate way.</p><h3>Learn
    to stabilize</h3><p>Overwhelming or painful emotions may arise as you try to be
    kinder to yourself, a phenomenon that <a href="http://self-compassion.org/tips-for-practice/">Neff
    refers to as backdrafting</a>. You may recall times when you felt ignored, rejected,
    or invalidated. Fears came rushing up. When this happens, it’s important to catch
    yourself before you fall back into old habits of using self-criticism as a motivator.
    Instead, create some distance to observe your reactions, using a mindfulness technique
    developed by psychologist Tara Brach: <a href="https://www.mindful.org/tara-brach-rain-mindfulness-practice/">RAIN</a>,
    which stands for Recognize, Allow, Investigate, Natural Loving Awareness. The
    steps to practice RAIN, from <a href="https://www.mindful.org/tara-brach-rain-mindfulness-practice/">Brach’s
    article for Mindful Magazine</a>, are:</p><blockquote><h1><strong>R</strong>ecognize**
    what is going on** — Acknowledge your thoughts and feelings in the moment. <a
    href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17576282">Label them</a>.</h1><h1>Allow
    the experience to be there; just as it is — Pause. Relax your body and your mind.
    Breathe.</h1><h1>Investigate with interest and care — Get curious. Ask questions
    like, “What is this reaction telling me? What do I need most right now?”</h1><h1>Natural
    Loving Awareness—not identifying with the experience. “This practice of non-identification
    means that our sense of who we are is not fused with any limiting emotions, sensations,
    or stories.”</h1></blockquote><p>You can also learn to stabilize by reminding
    yourself to use healthy, realistic self-talk and shift perspecitve. Practice gratitude.
    Recall past times you’ve overcome challenges. Remind yourself of <a href="http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspi0000018.pdf">life’s
    simple pleasures</a>, like a hug, the blue sky on a clear day, or your favorite
    smell.</p><h3>Meditate</h3><p>Neff’s <a href="http://self-compassion.org/category/exercises/#exercises">website
    includes a vast set of guided meditations and other exercises</a> to help you
    work through challenging emotions and develop inner calm.</p><p>Meditation is
    a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/8/1/85/1694475">well-known</a>
    method to improve your ability to handle situations in a more rational way. While
    we normally think of this kind of emotional control in terms of regulating outbursts
    with others, it can also help us avoid tendencies to dump or rage at ourselves
    internally.</p><h2>Keep practicing to reap the rewards</h2><p>Like any skill,
    developing self-compassionate takes time and deliberate practice.</p><p>Truthfully,
    it’s a lesson I have to remind myself of frequently. I’ve internalized reframing,
    especially as a valuable strategy to spot my unhelpful stories and acknowledge
    my inner voice, without slipping into comparison and self-criticism. But, I still
    slip into funks now and then. I’m human, after all (which, if you’re paying attention,
    is self-compassion in action!)</p><p>While it’s important to be patient and understanding
    with yourself throughout the process, self-compassion also entails responsibility
    and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/05/why-self-compassion-works-better-than-self-esteem/481473/">gentle-but-pragmatic
    firmness</a>.</p><p>Self-compassion is not about letting yourself off the hook.
    It’s recognizing that you have the ability to improve and understand the science
    that shows accepting yourself works far better than hating yourself — especially
    if you want to achieve big goals.</p>'

  :title: Want To Improve Your Self-Awareness? Answer These 20 Questions
  :content: '<p>‘Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom,’ Aristotle said</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4242/1*yroVo-5kdH7xybiWsYsuCA.jpeg" alt="Photo:
    Chalabala/Getty Images"><em>Photo: Chalabala/Getty Images</em></p><p>It’s not
    exactly a revelation that self-awareness is a key component of success. In fact,
    we’ve been extolling its importance for thousands of years. The Greek philosopher
    Aristotle, who lived between 384 and 322 BC, once said, “Knowing yourself is the
    beginning of all wisdom.”</p><p>Truly knowing yourself requires serious effort.
    But unfortunately, there’s no set path to self-awareness, no standardized steps
    you can take to reach it.</p><p>That said, taking some time to examine yourself
    — your skills, your desires, your motivations — helps. It’s a way to do the work
    of getting to know yourself better.</p><p>In an effort to become more self-aware
    in my own life, I developed a list of 20 questions to reflect on:</p><ol><li><p>What
    am I good at?</p></li><li><p>What am I so-so at?</p></li><li><p><a href="https://forge.medium.com/when-youre-truly-good-at-your-job-you-want-to-hear-the-ways-you-suck-at-it-6f4ba163d89e">What
    am I bad at?</a></p></li><li><p>What makes me tired?</p></li><li><p>What is the
    most important thing in my life?</p></li><li><p>Who are the most important people
    in my life?</p></li><li><p>How much sleep do I need?</p></li><li><p>What stresses
    me out?</p></li><li><p>What relaxes me?</p></li><li><p>What’s my definition of
    success?</p></li><li><p><a href="https://forge.medium.com/at-work-are-you-an-integrator-or-a-segmenter-a52dd40b7aa0">What
    type of worker am I?</a></p></li><li><p>How do I want others to see me?</p></li><li><p>What
    makes me sad?</p></li><li><p>What makes me happy?</p></li><li><p>What makes me
    angry?</p></li><li><p>What type of person do I want to be?</p></li><li><p>What
    type of friend do I want to be?</p></li><li><p>What do I think about myself?</p></li><li><p>What
    things do I value in life?</p></li><li><p>What makes me afraid?</p></li></ol><p>If
    you want to try it for yourself, answer with the first thing that pops up in your
    mind, and don’t think too hard about the meaning behind a question. Everyone interprets
    them differently. That’s the point.</p><p>Your initial answers aren’t even that
    important. What matters more is that the questions get you thinking, especially
    those that might be <a href="https://forge.medium.com/uncomfortable-truths-about-life-i-never-should-have-ignored-6dfef09059ba">difficult
    or uncomfortable to answer</a>, like “What am I bad at?”</p><p>Now comes the most
    critical part: reasoning. Use the thoughts you’ve assembled to improve your life
    by applying what Aristotle called “logos” — the capacity for rational speech.
    Historian Paul Rahe <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Zymp_kM33ZcC&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q&f=false">explained</a>
    the concept of logos best in his book <em>Republics Ancient and Modern</em>. “For
    Aristotle, logos is something more refined than the capacity to make private feelings
    public,” he wrote. “It makes it possible for him to perceive and make clear to
    others through reasoned discourse the difference between what is advantageous
    and what is harmful…”</p><p>That’s what you’re doing in your quest for self-awareness:
    trying to uncover which things about yourself are advantageous and which are harmful.</p><p><strong>Now
    what?</strong></p><p>Once you have an idea of what those things are, act on them.
    Double down on the advantageous stuff and start eliminating the harmful stuff,
    as much as you can. Do more things that make you happy or things you’re good at.
    Avoid things that make you unhappy or things you’re bad at.</p><p>That’s it. That’s
    knowing yourself.</p><p>Don’t take this process too literally. Relationships,
    for example, can make you both happy and sad. That doesn’t mean you should avoid
    getting close to anyone or ditch any relationships that involve sadness. Instead,
    try to avoid the specific things that make your relationships bad — things like
    selfishness, lying, lack of empathy, etc.</p><p>How do you practice logos in daily
    life? Here are some ideas:</p><ul><li><p>*<em>Read philosophy. *</em>If you don’t
    know where to start, I recommend reading a book like <em>The Story of Philosophy</em>
    by Will Durant. Philosophy is reasoning, so if you read more works by philosophers,
    you’ll learn more about how to present and work through ideas.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Become
    neutral in discussions with people. *</em>Don’t just try to prove a point. Always
    try to reason from different points of view.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://forge.medium.com/a-beginners-guide-to-keeping-a-journal-e8db9d0f150f">**Journal,
    and follow through</a> on your thoughts.** Always ask yourself, “Why?” For example:
    John made me mad. Why? Because he lied. Why? Because he didn’t want to upset me.
    Why? Because he cares about me.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Talk, talk, talk. *</em>With
    friends, colleagues, mentors, coaches. Just by vocalizing your feelings, you discover
    new things about yourself. Especially when you talk with people who ask questions
    that make you think.</p></li></ul><p>There you go. That’s my process for self-awareness.
    Introspection is difficult because you must be honest with yourself, and most
    of us prefer to lie because the truth is scary. But since I’ve begun practicing
    self-awareness more deliberately, my life has massively improved.</p><p>Knowing
    yourself makes living easier.</p>'

    Edward,</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Best Places Aren’t In the Guidebook.</strong>
    There are those moments when life asks you to say YES to the unknown. Some of
    my most wonderful memories of traveling around the globe began with a simple decision
    — should I be open to the unknown or not? When we try to plan everything out,
    we preclude the limitless possibilities. Like the time a couple guys I’d just
    met and I trusted a Costa Rican fisherman to take us an hour up the coast to a
    “playa bonita” he said he knew. We ended up having a mile-long stretch of virgin
    beach and one of the sweetest little surf breaks in the world all to ourselves
    for the better part of a week. All because we trusted in the unknown.</p></li><li><p><strong>Get
    Reality Checks from Those Who See Your Highest Self.</strong> Years ago I took
    a job as an international political consultant. I traveled the globe making more
    money than I ever thought possible providing campaign strategy advice to presidential
    candidates of foreign nations. The money and power went to my head, and I started
    to treat people poorly. It took my best friend from college sitting me down and
    telling me I was “turning into a total DB” before I saw what was happening to
    me. Your best friends know the best you. Listen to them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wear
    Well Made Shoes and Suits That Fit.</strong> Ok, this might seem superficial,
    especially after #2, but bear with me. Like many young men, I went through a phase
    of wearing XL everything — in spite of weighing 165 lbs. This lasted until my
    late 20’s when I bought my first tailored suit and real leather shoes. The difference
    in how I felt and how people regarded me was not subtle. It was like putting on
    10 years of stature and prestige. So, don’t waste money on cheap suits and shoes.
    You’ll just look…cheap. Instead, get 2 impeccable suits (1 navy blue, 1 dark gray/charcoal)
    and two pairs of Italian or English shoes (1 brown, 1 black), and wear the hell
    out of them. <strong>ProTip</strong>: Wear the brown shoes with the blue suit,
    and the black shoes with the gray suit, for god’s sake.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cancel
    Meetings You’re Not Ready For.</strong> In one sense, we’re never truly “ready”
    for any meeting. We all need to take risks and just go for it. This isn’t about
    those meetings. This is about those meetings you really shouldn’t be having because
    too much is at stake and you might totally blow it. When I was 25 I had an important
    meeting with a member of Congress at 8am on a Friday. Unfortunately, Thursday
    night got away from a colleague and me, and I showed up to the meeting in no condition
    to be speaking to anyone. If you are going to lose more ground by having the meeting
    than by canceling, just cancel.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Talk to the Pretty Girl. *</em>Or
    the handsome boy. Or the VC you want to raise money from. Or the TV personality
    you always admired. I wasted years of my life not talking to the people I really
    wanted to get to know. I told myself stories in my head that they’d never want
    to talk to me. That I wasn’t cool enough, handsome enough, funny enough, smart
    enough. And then I realized that all those people were thinking the same thing
    about themselves. So, I started being more proactive. I talked to the pretty girl
    at the party. I told the TV personality I admired him and wanted to work for him.
    And sure, sometimes I got turned down, but most often, I got exactly what I was
    looking for — a date, a job, etc. Because life is sending you perfect pitches
    all the time. All you have to do is swing the bat.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ignore
    the Haters.</strong> Sadly, there will always be people who don’t love themselves
    enough to love you. There will always people who see how you choose to live, where
    you travel, or what you’ve done and feel competitive with you. Heck, there are
    even those who imagine what you’ve done and who you are, and hate you for the
    image of you they have. Ignore them. All of them.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Copy People
    You Admire. *</em>When I was 26, I was doing research on the new motorcycle I
    had purchased, and I read about a couple traveling around the world on their honeymoon
    on my exact model of bike. I was so inspired, I decided to do a similar trip.
    Within 6 months, I had quit my job running an environmental non-profit and drove
    south. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111218222155/http://www.edsgonesouth.com/">The
    travel blog I wrote about my trip</a> ended up in Forbes and the Guardian, and
    inspired thousands more people to do a similar trip. Of course, there’s also the
    other side of the coin — don’t emulate people you don’t admire. Sometimes people
    seem like they have it all — like they should be good examples to follow. They
    have the wealth and influence you want, and a lot of other people try to emulate
    them. But something about them doesn’t feel right to you. Maybe it’s their business
    ethics. Maybe it’s how they treat women or their families. Just trust your gut
    and stay away from them. Far away.</p></li><li><p><strong>If You Lead (Well),
    They Will Follow.</strong> I’ve learned that there are those people who demand
    respect, and those who command it. Demanding respect is leading poorly. It’s driven
    by self interest and fear of being judged or undermined. Commanding respect is
    leading through action and example. It is humble and is driven by a higher purpose.
    While leading well may also be nerve wracking, the fear that comes up is worry
    that others might not be well served by your leadership, not that your image might
    be tarnished. Just remember that in 99% of situations, people are looking for
    leadership. They are looking for selfless leaders. Give them the leadership they
    seek — in the interest of serving their interests — and they will follow.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Figure
    Out Your Unfair Advantage. *</em>We all have something we are naturally amazing
    at. Some people pick up the guitar or a paint brush and make art from the first
    try. Others can put into simple prose the huge ideas we can’t seem to get out
    of our heads. And still others can negotiate a business deal so well everyone
    feels like they need a cigarette once it’s over. Whatever you do so well that
    few others can match you, do more of it. My skill-set is two fold — 1) I help
    people get honest with themselves and put words, intention, and action behind
    their dreams, and 2) I can create a vision and motivate teams to bring great things
    to life. So, today, I’m both a coach and an entrepreneur. But I didn’t know that
    for a long time. I tried being a number of other careers before this one. And
    I have no regrets. All of those experiences simply made me even better at what
    I do today.</p></li><li><p><strong>Choose Friends Who Dream Big, But Don’t Compete
    with Them.</strong> Friends who make big plans for themselves will push you to
    make big plans for yourself. Spend more time with those people. On the other hand,
    friends who think small will discourage your big dreams because frankly, no one
    likes being left behind. Spend less time with those people. But don’t EVER compare
    where you are today to where other people are. We all have our own timeline. We
    all have our own luck. Admire the success of your friends. Emulate it if you can.
    But don’t be jealous of it. Jealousy is the fastest way to lose the people you
    want to be closest to.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Build Your Dreams, or Someone Else
    Will Pay You to Build Theirs. *</em>Those people whom you admire most, the ones
    who have built companies, won elected office, recorded hit songs, etc… They didn’t
    get there by working for someone else. Sure, we all serve someone, whether it
    be customers, constituencies, or fans, but at the end of the day, you won’t leave
    the impact you want in this world by punching the clock for someone else. So,
    take the time you need working for mentors to learn your trade, but some time
    before you feel fully ready, set out on your own. Start a new firm. Launch a new
    start-up. Record a solo album. Just do it. And when you fail — which you will
    the first time or two — just get up and do it again. Because as they say, “<em>Success
    is going from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm.”</em></p></li></ol><p>Love

    alt=""></p><p>This all brings me to self-made billionaire, entrepreneur, investor,
    and polymath Ray Dalio. Dalio is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the largest
    hedge fund in the world, and his approach to and results from uncovering and using
    <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-tell-if-someone-is-truly-smart-or-just-average-a2f0bcac5db2">deep
    principles and mental models</a> is unparalleled. Over the last 40 years, Dalio
    has meticulously identified and stress-tested a set of universal, success principles,
    and then created detailed step-by-step systems that his 1,500-person team uses
    to make management and investment decisions. This year, he effectively open-sourced
    everything with the release of his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1501124021/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=lrc1981-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1501124021&linkId=4189b58412d81443082f38c1504c74b1">Principles:

    Life and Work</a> by Ray Dalio</em></p><p>Let’s dive into Dalio’s three levels
    of reality…</p><h2><strong>Reality Level 1: Getting Stuff Done</strong></h2><p>Most
    people operate in this realm. The output of a good sales call is a closed sale.
    The outcome of a good meeting is the resolution of a specific problem. Conversely,
    a bad sales call is one that doesn’t result in a new customer. A bad meeting is
    one that decides nothing.</p><p>This level of reality is essentially about getting
    stuff done: creating a to-do list from most important to least important and then
    kicking butt right on down the list. Dalio calls this layer of reality the blizzard
    because lots of things are constantly coming at you from different directions,
    and it’s hard to get clarity on what really matters.</p><p>Dalio’s book is not
    written on this level. Most books are.</p><h2><strong>Reality Level 2: Principles</strong></h2><p>To
    people like Dalio, the value of an activity isn’t just its immediate result, but
    also the underlying principles at play. The principles you learn in any situation
    are often more valuable than the immediate result, because you can apply them
    for the rest of your life across all areas to make better decisions.</p><p>For
    example, let’s say you’re a salesperson. At Level 2, each sales call is an opportunity
    to learn about related principles on multiple levels:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*_ejWk2FHmpXFwU8m."
    alt="Source: [Michael Simmons](https://medium.com/@michaeldsimmons)"><em>Source:
    <a href="https://medium.com/@michaeldsimmons">Michael Simmons</a></em></p><p>As
    you move down toward <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-tell-if-someone-is-truly-smart-or-just-average-a2f0bcac5db2">fundamental
    mental models</a> of what selling is and how it works, you gets closer to principles
    that are more timeless and universal.</p><p>Once you reach the “timeless and universal”
    level, you can apply a principle or mental model to exponentially more situations.
    And this is the key here. Once you reach an understanding of a mental model, you
    have a tool that can apply in many situations now and in the future to help you
    be more efficient, get more done, make better decisions, have better relationships,
    become more successful, and become more impactful.</p><p>Let’s take Stephen Covey’s
    fundamental principle of ‘Seek first to understand and then to be understood’
    as an example. This principle can help you sell a product, but it can also help
    you be a better parent, have a happier marriage, enjoy deeper friendships, and
    get along with people of different cultures, faiths, and political backgrounds.
    <strong>If you’re interested in learning more about the value of fundamental principles
    and mental models, I wrote about it in <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-tell-if-someone-is-truly-smart-or-just-average-a2f0bcac5db2">How
    To Tell If Someone Is Truly Smart Or Just Average</a>.</strong></p><p>So let’s
    say you have a sales call where the prospect doesn’t buy from and become a customer.
    If you operated from Level 1 of reality, this call would be a painful waste of
    time. To Dalio, at Level 2, it would be a learning opportunity because of his
    following core principle:</p><blockquote><p>“Pain + Reflection = Progress.”</p></blockquote><p>As
    he explains:</p><blockquote><p>“There’s so much more that you can learn from mistakes
    because they give you a loud signal. Rewards keep you doing the same things, and
    so you don’t grow from successes… Mistakes, if you can deal with them the right
    way, with reflection is where the growth comes from.”</p></blockquote><p>Dalio’s
    approach is counterintuitive on two levels. First, society typically judges success
    by first-order results (i.e., immediate sales), not second-order ones (i.e., improving
    the system that makes sales). Secondly, our natural reaction to pain is to resist
    it and react emotionally. Dalio has built systems, tools, and habits that help
    him move toward pain, react logically and objectively, and engage in thoughtful
    disagreement rather than arguments, which I’ll explain later in the article. While
    we all intellectually understand that we can learn from pain, I’ve never come
    across someone who is as systematic and committed to it as Dalio.</p><p>While
    Level 1 of reality is a blizzard, Level 2 is more like standing on a mountaintop
    in a clear sky looking down at the blizzard.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*rkghOYTGRU-WW_N4."
    alt="Source: [Michael Simmons](https://medium.com/@michaeldsimmons)"><em>Source:
    <a href="https://medium.com/@michaeldsimmons">Michael Simmons</a></em></p><p>And
    because you have this wider aperture on life, you’re able to see connections more
    naturally. Dalio explains:</p><blockquote><p>“With time and experience, I came
    to see each encounter as ‘another one of those’ that I could approach more calmly
    and analytically, like a biologist might approach an encounter with a threatening
    creature in the jungle: first identifying its species and then, drawing on his
    prior knowledge about its expected behaviors, reacting appropriately. When I was
    faced with types of situations I had encountered before, I drew on the principles
    I had learned for dealing with them. But when I ran into ones I hadn’t seen before,
    I would be painfully surprised. Studying all those painful first-time encounters,
    I learned that even if they hadn’t happened to me, most of them had happened to
    other people in other times and places, which gave me a healthy respect for history,
    a hunger to have a universal understanding of how reality works, and the desire
    to build timeless and universal principles for dealing with it.”</p></blockquote><p>While
    we all learn from our experiences at some level, what separates Dalio is two things.
    First, he doesn’t just pull from his own seven decades of personal experience.
    He attempts to pull from all experiences of recorded history*<em>. *</em>This
    approach gives him a tremendous advantage as investor because some financial cycles
    happen every few months or few years, but other cycles only happen every few decades
    or every century. With Dalio’s wider lens, he can see those patterns. Our own
    personal experiences are a drop in the ocean of humanity’s experiences through
    all time.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*9kqoeotrehwfVwt4."
    alt="Source: [Michael Simmons](https://medium.com/@michaeldsimmons)"><em>Source:
    <a href="https://medium.com/@michaeldsimmons">Michael Simmons</a></em></p><p>Secondly,
    he doesn’t just learn from his experience reactively and unconsciously. He is
    extremely deliberate. This is important because of the <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/why-the-smartest-people-are-constant-learners-eb0f90559fec">OK
    Plateau</a> — most people learn quickly in new situations, but soon plateau after
    they’re “good enough” and never get better with more experience. This has been
    heavily studied in the professional world, and it’s evident in our daily lives.
    Has driving more made you a better driver? Has typing more made you a better typist?</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*TenZx2POX49xJ7jR." alt=""></p><p>I
    go into what I mean by “deliberate” in Level 3, as this is where the magic happens.</p><h2><strong>Reality
    Level 3: Algorithms</strong></h2><p>This is the point at which Dalio’s teachings
    started to blow my mind. It’s also the level which <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/07/25/mastering-the-machine">causes
    the most controversy in the media</a>. Dalio has systematically taken his principles
    and turned them into algorithms in computers that he uses to make better investing
    and people decisions.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*MuRQmGYa5fEBGaiC."
    alt="Source: [Michael Simmons](https://medium.com/@michaeldsimmons)"><em>Source:
    <a href="https://medium.com/@michaeldsimmons">Michael Simmons</a></em></p><p>What
    does that mean in practice? For one, Dalio’s company, Bridgewater, has <a href="https://seminal.lpages.co/ray-dalio-dictionary/?utm_source=Medium&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=14&utm_content=CTA1">developed
    several apps that employees use to make better decisions</a>. One of them is called
    the Pain Button. Here’s how it works:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*xzpz998CT-Z-G0Ov."
    alt=""></p><p>In building these apps and collecting the data from them, Bridgewater
    may have built the largest database of team interaction ever in the history of
    mankind.</p><p>Bridgewater, of course, doesn’t just focus on employee emotions,
    but also on their investments. Starting in the 1970s, Dalio created investment
    algorithms and turned them into code. Over time, he improved the code in two ways:</p><ul><li><p>As
    he and his team learned more principles, they turned those into algorithms, and
    then turned those into code.</p></li><li><p>He and his team stress-tested the
    algorithms using historical data. In other words, he fed historical data into
    the program. Then, he let his algorithm run loose to see what decisions it would’ve
    made in that historical context. With the gift of hindsight, he was able to see
    the actual amount of money the algorithm would’ve made or lost without risking
    a penny.</p></li><li><p>With the results from stress-testing, he and his team
    refined the principles, algorithms, and code.</p></li></ul><p>As Bridgewater got
    better and better results, they trusted the system more and more, and started
    using it to help make real-world investment decisions. Over time, the algorithms
    have become effective enough for Bridgewater to trust its decisions 98 percent
    of the time.</p><p>In short, at Level 3, Dalio doesn’t just let the general principles
    of Level 2 remain general principles. He systematically understands how the principles
    interact with each other to create specific results in the world:</p><blockquote><p>“Visualizing
    complex systems as machines, figuring out the cause-effect relationships within
    them, writing down the principles for dealing with them, and feeding them into
    a computer so the computer could ‘make decisions’ for me all became standard practices.”</p></blockquote><p>Dalio’s
    approach sparks controversy among many: “What about the chaos and randomness of
    life? You can’t reduce complex decisions or dynamics between people into engineering
    problems!” This is where it’s important to understand that Dalio doesn’t claim
    to have a perfect machine that does everything perfectly without humans. Dalio
    views his machine as a trusted advisor to human decision-making.</p><p>Naturally,
    Dalio has immense financial and human resources to build his machines. But we
    can still learn from and emulate his approach. For example, Dalio’s approaches
    have had a huge impact on me in two ways:</p><ul><li><p>After reading his work,
    I realized I had a pervasive pattern of ignoring painful problems or only dealing
    with them once they blew up. So, I started logging problems, doing a weekly root
    cause analysis conversation with my wife, with myself, and with our team.</p></li><li><p>Rather
    than just being a writer, our company created an idea machine where we systematically
    found principles of how quality ideas are created and how they spread. We stress-tested
    those principles with <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/forget-about-the-10-000-hour-rule-7b7a39343523">lots

    15 million times across platforms in the last 3 years with just a few dozen articles.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Putting
    It All Together: Rethinking Productivity</strong></h2><p>We all just have 24 hours
    in a day. Yet some people move much closer toward their goals than others. In
    other words, they get more value from each experience they have. The learning
    value that Dalio gets from every moment is exponentially greater than the average
    person.</p><p>In order to unlock this value, Dalio focuses on three levels of
    reality while most people focus on just one. He also thinks about his time differently.
    Rather than just focusing the day around getting stuff done, throughout his career
    he has focused on constant and deliberate learning. I call this tendency for many
    of the busiest, most successful leaders to spend at least 5 hours or more per
    week learning the <a href="https://medium.com/@michaeldsimmons/bill-gates-warren-buffett-and-oprah-all-use-the-5-hour-rule-308f528b6363">5-hour
    rule</a>.</p><p>Dalio’s approach means he gets less done in a day, but gets drastically
    more done in his life. This happens because the value of operating on Levels 2
    &amp; 3 <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/why-successful-people-spend-10-hours-a-week-on-compound-time-79d64d8132a8">compound
    over time</a>. After 40 years of living at all three levels of reality, Dalio
    has built up an incredibly powerful legacy:</p><ul><li><p>*<em>Core principles

    management machine</strong> that has helped Bridgewater scale to 1,500-plus employees
    that any company could use.</p></li></ul><p>When most people ask themselves how
    they can take their life to the next level, they often think about new skills
    they could start or bad habits they could stop. This is Level 1 thinking. It works,
    but only so far.</p><p>By understanding the different levels of reality, we can
    all break through the glass ceilings in our life and <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/if-you-dont-want-to-regret-your-life-30-years-later-make-this-one-choice-right-now-1cc137516df0">realize

  :title: 'To self-doubting developers: are you good enough?'
  :content: "<p>Does any of the following sound familiar?</p><p>You constantly worry
    that you are not good enough.</p><p>Look at the developers around you. They seem
    to have everything together. Their code is cleaner than yours. They debug much
    faster than you do. They merely glance at documentation before knowing what they
    need. They are confident. They enjoy coding.</p><p>But you, you are worried. You
    worry that you don’t know enough about the framework and the language you are
    using. You worry about introducing bugs. You worry about catching up with the
    hottest technologies. You worry that you are not talented enough. Things don’t
    come naturally to you. You think to yourself: “Maybe I’m not meant to be a developer.”</p><p>If
    any of these self-doubting thoughts sounds familiar to you, you are not alone.
    Google “self-doubt developers”, and you will find over 2 million results in less
    than a second.</p><h2><strong>I was you.</strong></h2><p>For a period of time,
    I also experienced intense self-doubt, wondering if I would ever “make it”. <a
    href=\"https://www.sihui.io/from-hello-world-to-facebook-airbnb-salesforce/\">It
    happened in college when I was practicing and preparing for job interviews. Each
    day, those algorithm problems made me feel like a complete failure. I was stressed
    and worried, as much as you might be now.</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.sihui.io/from-hello-world-to-facebook-airbnb-salesforce/\">Eventually,
    my practice paid off and I received multiple job offers from prestigious tech
    companies.</a> Along the way, I learnt two important lessons that changed my view
    of programming and eliminated my self-doubting thoughts. I’m sharing them with
    you now. Hopefully, they help.</p><h2>Lesson #1: Learning programming is exactly
    the same as building muscles</h2><p>To learn to play soccer, you need to go to
    the field and play. To build stronger muscles, you need to go to the gym and lift
    those weights. To learn programming, you need to sit down and code.</p><p>After
    lifting weights, you will feel sore and tired the next day. When stuck on a programming
    problem, your brain will (literally) hurt and you will get frustrated.</p><p>You
    won’t give up working out simply because of feeling sore. You know it’s part of
    the process. But when you get stuck while programming, you might start doubting
    yourself, wondering if you are talented enough. Because: (1) you think getting
    stuck is your fault, (2) others make it seemed effortless.</p><h3><strong>1. Getting
    stuck is part of the process.</strong></h3><p>Maybe no one has told you that,
    but it’s absolutely normal to get stuck during programming. It happens even to
    senior developers. A big part of programming is about figuring out why what you
    expected to happen didn’t happen. If you agree that expecting a child to be able
    to walk the first time he or she stands up is absurd, why would you expect the
    first draft of your code to run perfectly without any bugs?</p><p>I remember times
    when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sihui_io/status/940813707646513152\">I got
    stuck for so long that I wanted to bang my head against a wall</a>. I know it’s
    hard and frustrating (especially when dealing with issues related to dev environments).
    But hang in there. Dig into the issue. Ask Google. Ask a friend. Take a walk.
    You will eventually solve it and move on. And as you gain more experience, you
    will gradually get stuck less.</p><p>Next time you get stuck, don’t give yourself
    a hard time. Remind yourself it’s not your fault. It’s normal. It’s part of the
    process.</p><p><strong>PS — Setting up a dev environment might be the most difficult
    part of programming.</strong></p><p>It’s very common to get stuck and spend days
    on setting up a development environment. These are moments that might crush your
    soul. You try to follow the instructions step by step. But random errors keep
    showing up in every single step. The instructions make it seem easy, but it’s
    not. It’s not your fault getting stuck. 99.99% of the people reading that tutorial
    get stuck. The remaining 0.01% are the lucky ones who happen to have the exact
    same operating system setup as the instructor.</p><p>It’s unfortunate that the
    first step of learning to program is also the most frustrating and soul-crushing
    part. When you see errors you can’t understand, just copy the exact error message
    and Google it. (Putting quotes around the error message or just search the first
    half of the message might help.) Try different solutions until you find the one
    that works. And move on.</p><p>Pardon me for repeating: *<em>getting stuck at
    this stage is not your fault. We ALL do. *</em>And I promise programming will
    become a lot more fun once you get past this stage.</p><h3><strong>2. We confuse
    “</strong>genetically** smart” with “appeared smart because the person has spent
    tons of time on related subjects”**</h3><p>During my last semester in college,
    my friends were amazed by how well I did in the Advanced Data Structures &amp;
    Algorithms class. I made it seem effortless while they were struggling.</p><p>What
    they didn’t know was that months before the class, to prepare for interviews,
    <a href=\"https://www.sihui.io/from-hello-world-to-facebook-airbnb-salesforce/\">I
    had spent countless hours practicing coding challenges, which covered the exact
    same topics as the class: dynamic programming, depth-first search, breadth-first
    search, etc. **It appeared effortless only because I had already been through
    these struggles.</a>**</p><p>When I first self-taught these concepts, I would
    spend hours staring at a problem and couldn’t figure it out. When I gave up and
    looked up solutions online, I struggled to understand them. When I finally did,
    I felt even more frustrated because I doubted I would ever be smart enough to
    come up with such a solution myself.</p><p>Sometimes even when I encountered the
    exact same problem again, I might’ve still had no clue on how to approach it.
    I would get so stressed that I had to take long hot showers to calm myself down.</p><p>So
    believe me when I say that I know how it feels to doubt yourself and worry that
    you can’t make it. I have been there before. And I can assure you that you are
    not alone. Many great developers have been through the same thing. (Here is <a
    href=\"https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/271-rr-problems-new-developers-dont-realize-they-have-and-hidden-tradeoffs-to-coding-decisions-developers-have-to-make-with-justin-weiss\">a
    podcast about this topic</a>.)</p><p>Next time you are struggling while people
    around you are excelling, don’t think it’s because you are not talented enough.
    Most likely, they just have more exposure to the subject, or similar subjects,
    than you. Their brains have built up the “muscles” to handle this type of subject.
    After you get through your current struggles, you will appear smart and effortless
    as well.</p><p><strong>It’s all about reps and sets.</strong></p><p>You build
    muscles by exercising them. The more effort you put in, the longer you train,
    the stronger you become. Learning programming has the exact same process. The
    more time you spend coding, the more proficient you will be. You reap what you
    sow.</p><h2>Lesson #2: Focus on your craft, not you</h2><p>Stop thinking about
    how good or how bad of a programmer you are. If you are in the bottom 5% of your
    team, you want to get better. If you are in the top 5%, you still want to get
    better. No matter how good or bad you are, there are always people in front of
    you and people behind you. So why waste time thinking about it?</p><p>Instead,
    focus on your craft. Stop asking how good you are. Ask how good your code is.
    How can you make it better, faster, more readable? Surround yourself with engineers
    you admire. Read their code. How is it different than yours? What are the trade-offs
    they are making?</p><p>If you already work as a software engineer, someone is
    paying you to write code. You should pause and reflect on it, as it means a lot:
    someone either believes in your coding skill or sees your potential. The only
    way to live up to that potential is to focus on your craft and improve it relentlessly.</p><h2>Action
    Item: Start keeping track of small wins</h2><p>When was the last time you got
    stuck and weren’t sure if you could solve the problem? How did you eventually
    solve it?</p><p>Open a new Google Doc and write it down.</p><p>Next time you doubt
    yourself, take a look at the doc and remind yourself: if you could solve that
    last problem, you will solve this one as well.</p><p>Use the doc to keep track
    of challenging problems you overcame and what you learned from them. Always, always
    celebrate these small wins!</p><p>Leave a comment and share the last time you
    got stuck to remind those who are currently struggling that they are not alone.

  :title: When Self-Help Just Makes Your Life Worse
  :content: '<p>When Self-Help Just Makes Your Life Worse</p><h3><em>The pitfalls
    of organizing your days around productivity hacks, scheduled mindfulness, and
    constant self-improvement</em></h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5000/0*tEAKs2Va_HLIC4Jg"
    alt="Photo by [rawpixel](https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral)"><em>Photo
    by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral">rawpixel</a></em></p><p>It
    started with the internet. Every time she was online, it seemed like Bénédicte
    Kinkolo was served up another story about some successful person doing something
    great: running a business, winning awards, making millions of dollars.</p><p>Kinkolo,
    then a second-year student at King’s College in London, ate it up. She knew she
    wanted to be this kind of successful, though she wasn’t yet sure at what. Maybe
    emulating the people she read about — their habits, their routines, what they
    thought about before bed — would help her figure it out. She dove into self-help
    literature, began waking up early to do yoga and meditate, color-coded her schedule.
    Bent on maximizing her time as much as possible, she made a daily to-do list and
    followed it rigidly; she downloaded productivity apps that would alert her when
    her time on a task was drawing to a close.</p><p>One day before finals, Kinkolo
    recalls, she was running around the university library, gathering books for a
    paper and ticking things off one of her apps, when she missed a step and fell
    down a flight of stairs, fracturing her ankle. At the hospital, as doctors and
    nurses shuttled in and out of her room, she continued to work from her laptop,
    lest her app remind her that she was falling behind.</p><p>Her breaking point
    wouldn’t come for several more years — but this summer, after finishing college
    and then two graduate degrees with the same frantic productivity, Kinkolo, now
    23, finally burnt out. She’s currently taking a break, living with her parents
    in her hometown of Paris as she figures out what she wants to do next, and leading
    a very different lifestyle than the one she’d imagined. She doesn’t make lists
    or use productivity apps or meditate each morning. “I never expected in a million
    years that I would take a break,” she says. “It’s the weirdest and most difficult
    and most challenging thing that I have done in my life.” During her time off,
    Kinkolo has worked with a therapist to try to change her perspective on “success”
    and her relentless pursuit of goals. “It got to a point where I didn’t have any
    agency anymore,” she says. “I was letting the lists and the apps and the routines
    run my life for me.”</p><p>In recent years, self-improvement efforts like Kinkolo’s
    have spawned a behemoth of an industry. The <a href="https://blog.marketresearch.com/the-10-billion-self-improvement-market-adjusts-to-new-generation">U.S.
    self-help market</a> was worth nearly $10 billion in 2016 and is estimated to
    grow to $13 billion by 2022. The appeal is easy to understand: It’s exhilarating
    to think you can follow a prescribed routine to optimize your time, your resources,
    and yourself.</p><p>“Life is complicated, but self-help makes you feel like there’s
    a solution to all your problems, right there in that five- or 10-step guide,”
    says Jeremy Montemarano, a clinical psychotherapist in Spring, Texas. “Most changes
    in life require time and processing and, in the case of mental health, working
    with a professional. So it’s tempting to pick up something that promises to bypass
    all that, probably at the fraction of effort and cost.”</p><p>That temptation
    is often compounded by social media and articles offering a carefully edited window
    into someone’s high-powered schedule. “When you have more access to other people’s
    lives, even though you know they may be curated, it’s easy to create problems
    that might not really be there because you think you’re behind,” Montemarano adds.</p><p>In
    some cases, a deep dive into the world of self-improvement can end up feeling
    counterproductive or even harmful. And butting up against this world is a counterculture
    of people who have given up on it entirely in search of something simultaneously
    less taxing and more fulfilling.</p><blockquote><h1>“Most changes in life require
    time and processing, so it’s tempting to pick up something that promises to bypass
    all that.”</h1></blockquote><p>Ironically, one of the biggest pitfalls of embarking
    on a self-improvement quest is that it can stunt any real change — it’s easy to
    hide behind routines and habits instead of tackling bigger things. Kinkolo bowed
    out of her obsessive to-do lists and routines when she realized that her days
    lacked meaning. “I liked that my days had structure, but it got to a point where
    what I was doing was mindless,” she says. “I became more obsessed with checking
    things off a list than thinking about the work I was doing.”</p><p>“Self-help
    can be a distraction or an escape from relationships or creating meaning in your
    life or community,” says Perpetua Neo, a psychologist and executive coach based
    in Brighton, England. “For example, when people procrastinate, it may not be because
    they can’t focus or don’t know how to manage their schedule — they could just
    hate their jobs. But they’ll deny themselves that because they think it might
    be too late or hard or embarrassing to change, so they’ll read about ways they
    can stop procrastinating instead.”</p><p>Sometimes the problems being masked are
    more serious. After becoming a mom for the first time, Shereen Thor, an executive
    life coach in Los Angeles, felt unsettled by her constantly shifting emotions.
    “One day I would be fine. The next day I would be crying. The next day I would
    be raging,” she recalls. “Since I had been a generally optimistic and emotionally
    stable person until then, I thought it had to be me.”</p><p>Believing that changing
    her attitude was the key to getting out of her funk, Thor leaned on her coaching
    colleagues, who used their typical strategies to help her out. When she wasn’t
    feeling better, Thor’s husband convinced her to see her doctor; during that visit,
    she learned that the issue was actually postpartum depression. “Coaching is often
    based on the premise that you are responsible for your own results, so with this
    premise, I blamed myself for my inability to get it together,” Thor says. “I honestly
    believe if I wasn’t a coach, it would have been an easier path.”</p><p>That’s
    not to say that all self-improvement efforts are futile. “Obviously there are
    many layers to self-improvement, and I would never be against someone organizing
    their time so they can do more valuable or meaningful activities with it,” says
    Svend Brinkmann, a Danish psychology professor and author of the buzzy anti-self-help
    book <em>Stand Firm</em>. “I just think people turn improvement into the purpose
    of their life and spend too much time worrying about how they can optimize themselves
    and their schedules” — especially because it’s a quest with no clear ending.</p><p>Scientists
    who study self-improvement stress that not all change is created equal. Jack Bauer,
    a psychology professor who studies personal growth at the University of Dayton,
    recently led <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29999181">a study</a>
    about the types of stories people told themselves about their own important life
    events and how those narratives affected their well-being. “There were many stories
    that talked about self-improvement, this idea that the self can go from bad to
    good or from good to better,” he says. “And we found that it’s not just any self-improvement
    that relates to happiness and well-being, but self-improvement that’s focused
    on personally meaningful activities and relationships, things you would do because
    you love them or connections you would pursue because you love the person. Improving
    yourself for the sake of self-image or status doesn’t make the same impact.”</p><p>Clearly,
    not everyone can take a sabbatical to think about what they really want. But even
    taking a few minutes each day to evaluate why you’re pursuing change can bring
    richer, more meaningful personal growth, Bauer says. Maybe you’re into self-improvement
    because you believe you can grow in some specific and important way and want to
    learn the tools to get there. Or maybe it’s because you feel that your life is
    very far from all the “successful people” whose daily lives have been pushed out
    into the world for our consumption.</p><p>Taking a critical eye to your own projects
    and routines can help you figure out if you’re doing them for truly productive
    reasons or if you’re doing them to get closer to some arbitrary goal that has
    little connection to what you truly want or need. There’s good in taking time
    to change, reevaluate, reassess, and strive to be better — it’s human nature to
    want to improve. The question is how much do you really need to?</p>'

    management.</p><p>Here are the top tips on billionaire productivity tips I know
    (which I learned from this book and all the other videos and podcasts I consumed).</p><h2>1.
    Do the #1 Most Important Task At The Start of the Day</h2><p>Nathan Blecharczyk,
    billionaire and co-founder of Airbnb, says he fills his calendar from reverse.</p><p>He
    schedules things from the end of the day to the start so that he can focus on
    the real work in the morning. He makes sure to leave meetings for late in the
    day because they’re not as important.</p><p>You want to start your day with your
    #1 most important task and finish it first because otherwise, you get distracted
    with less important requests, tasks, and email.</p><h2>2. Don’t Multitask</h2><p>Billionaire
    Mike Cannon-Brookes gave some short advice for the book:</p><blockquote><p><em>Do
    one thing at once. Stop multitasking!</em></p></blockquote><p>When I was young,
    I grew up with multitasking and could do it better than most people. I used to
    pride myself on the process.</p><p>Later on, I did some research on multitasking.
    Studies show that it decreases productivity, especially for the young people who
    have done it for longer. The American Psychological Association found that <a
    href="http://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask.aspx">task switching can lead
    to a 40% decrease in productivity.</a></p><h2>3. Have Themed Days</h2><p>The youngest
    billionaire in history and founder of Facebook and Asana, Dustin Moskovitz, said:</p><blockquote><p><em>Have
    a themed day of the week where you don’t have meetings.</em></p></blockquote><p>He
    says it allows for no interruptions and focus on individual work.</p><p>At Asana,
    they have No Meeting Wednesday’s.</p><p>Billionaire Jack Dorsey of Twitter and
    Square also has themed days. Jack, like Elon Musk, works 80 hour weeks, 40 at
    each company.</p><p>In a 2011 interview at Techonomy, Dorsey said he accomplishes
    this by having themed days and being <em>very disciplined.</em></p><p>Every day
    has a theme and he does the same things around that theme at each company on a
    specific day.</p><p>These themes let him deal with interruptions and distractions.
    If a task or request is not in theme with the day, he does not do it. It sets
    a cadence for the rest of the company to deliver and check their progress:</p><p>His
    Mondays are for management.</p><p>His Tuesdays are for product.</p><p>Wednesdays
    are marketing and growth.</p><p>Thursdays are for developers and partnerships.</p><p>Fridays
    are on culture and recruiting.</p><p>Saturdays he takes off.</p><p>Sundays are
    for reflection, strategy, feedback, and getting ready for Monday.</p><h2>4. Discipline
    Matters More Than Intelligence</h2><p>The billionaire Andrew Mason, co-founder
    of Groupon and Detour, said that he’s met a lot of people who are smarter but
    less successful than him because <strong>they lack the discipline to do what they
    say they will:</strong></p><blockquote><p><em>“I often meet people who seem smarter
    than me yet are less capable because they don’t have the self-discipline and/or
    self-confidence to introspect on their ability to do what they think they’re going
    to do and *</em>find ways to iteratively improve*<em>. Amazingly, *it’s as simple
    as that</em>. It’s kind of a sore spot for me because I can’t understand why people
    don’t take it more seriously.” —Andrew Mason*</p></blockquote><p>He says <em>it’s
    that simple</em>. It’s not rocket science. <strong>Being disciplined about <a
    href="https://willyoulaugh.com/billionaire-habits/">forming great habits</a> is
    a true key to success.</strong></p><p>I highly recommend you read <em>The Power
    of Habit</em>. It goes into great scientific detail, while staying easy to read,
    on how to effectively form great habits and break bad habits.</p><p>Andrew said
    that if he was playing a video game that replicates real-life business and had
    ten points to distribute into skills, <strong>he’d put seven into discipline and
    three into intelligence.</strong></p><p>Nothing into Ability Power, Attack Damage,
    or Mana, Andrew? I jest. Nerd joke.</p><p>The point is to improve your willpower
    because it matters more than pure IQ.</p><h2>5. Recharge and Refresh Mid-Day To
    Keep Up Your Mental Fitness</h2><p>The youngest billionaire in Africa, Mohammed
    Dewji, says that mental fitness and a fresh mind are keys to success.</p><p>By
    one pm, he has already worked seven hours and it’s natural for him to feel drained
    and tired. He has a daily workout during his lunch hour to recharge and refresh.</p><p>This
    lets him attack the second half of his day as hard as he did the first half. He
    recommends finding what works best for you to stay invigorated and recharge. He
    acknowledges that people have different ways of doing it that work best.</p><p>There
    are hundreds of studies, articles, and books that prove how exercise is so beneficial
    to you in so many ways. Studies show that exercise increases your focus, energy,
    happiness, productivity, attractiveness, health, and longevity. <strong>Look at
    it as an *investment *rather than a time cost.</strong></p><p>Dustin Moskovitz,
    billionaire co-founder of Facebook, <a href="https://medium.com/building-asana/work-hard-live-well-ead679cb506d#.qzbttpia7">wrote
    a whole Medium post</a> saying how he regretted not exercising and eating better
    because he would have achieved his success *even faster, *and without the arguments
    and health problems he had.</p><h2>6. Devote at Least 50% of Your Time to Building
    Great Products. Avoid Ego-Gratifying Activities.</h2><p>Mark Pincus is the billionaire
    founder of <a href="https://www.zynga.com/">Zynga</a>, a video game app platform
    built on the back of the social network Facebook.</p><p>Mark says that if you
    want to build great products, you should spend at least 50% of your work time
    building great products.</p><p>He says <strong>don’t accept speaking opportunities
    if they don’t benefit your users or company.</strong></p><p>The same goes for
    any ego-boosting activities that don’t contribute to the bottom line success of
    your company, such as going on talk shows. <em>Good To Great</em> is a book that
    outlines the downfalls of doing this. Lee Iacocca was a bad-ass entrepreneur who
    took Chrysler from near-bankruptcy to a full revival. But during the second half
    of his tenure, he started spending most of his time on talk shows, TV shows, and
    other ego-boosting events. Chrysler’s stock took a huge plunge.</p><h2>7. Write
    Notes Down on Paper</h2><p>In the book, Greek billionaire Aristotle Onassis is
    quoted giving advice on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/drewhansen/2011/08/15/why-richard-branson-and-i-always-carry-a-notepad/#43cddd525a2f">writing
    things down.</a></p><p>He calls it his “million dollar lesson they don’t teach
    in business school.”</p><p>He recommends you write everything down in a notebook.
    Everything. This includes ideas, information about a new person you met, or interesting
    facts.</p><p>He says that if you write things down, you’re more likely to act
    on things. If you don’t, you forget.</p><p><a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/09/13/the-pocket-notebooks-of-20-famous-men/">Many
    successful people still write things down on paper</a>; this includes Brian Tracy,
    Napoleon Hill, <a href="https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/bill-gates-and-why-you-should-take-notes">Bill
    Gates</a>, and Richard Branson.</p><p>Richard Branson has spent a great deal of
    time emphasizing the importance of writing everything down immediately so you
    do not forget, especially in his articles online and his books <em>The Virgin
    Way *and *Business Stripped Bare</em>.</p><p>Richard tells the story of a man
    he knew who had the most incredible memory but forgot something at the absolutely
    worse time: during an important business deal. I have heard almost the exact same
    story from people in real life back when I tried to rely on my memory for everything.</p><p>Write
    it down on paper because it burns it into your brain and subconscious more than
    typing it out does. Ever since I started writing everything down, I realized how
    much I forget on a daily basis by looking at my notes later.</p><p>Even the genius
    rapper Eminem <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq-u-aOxvho">said in a
    60 Minutes Interview</a> that he always wrote things down whenever he had an idea
    for a lyric.</p><p>Taylor Swift has admitted in many interviews that she immediately
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiOMZHNCWiA">records a voice memo</a>
    if she has a song idea on her iPhone.</p><h2>8. Be Willing to Say No and Give
    Yourself Time</h2><p>CEO of LinkedIn Jeff Weiner schedules <strong>“do nothing”
    time</strong> on his calendar. He schedules 90 minutes to two hours in total a
    day, broken into 30 to 90-minute blocks.</p><p>No one can disturb him during this
    time.</p><p>He developed this system after having no time to process anything.
    His schedule was always packed with back-to-back meetings.</p><p>He realized these
    breaks were absolutely necessary to do his job well.</p><p>Many millionaires I
    have come across have voiced similar realizations.</p><p>They’ve burned out after
    years overwork to the point of physical illness and had to finally give themselves
    free time.</p><p>This includes some of the most followed people on social media,
    like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umlJgWK_Xxo">Cara DeLevingne</a>,
    Alicia Keys, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSwxK4pFF1o">Lady Gaga</a>.
    These three have also spoken publicly about it.</p><p>Cara suffered from skin
    and health issues from overwork. Her modeling agency shipped her to a hospital
    for a quick, unhealthy drug fix rather than tell her to rest.</p><h2>9. Reduce
    (or Eliminate) the Meetings You Have</h2><p>Mark Cuban said to never have a meeting
    unless you stand to make a lot of money: like a sales negotiation or when you
    are selling your company.</p><p>His exact words were:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Never
    do meetings unless someone is writing a check.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Warren
    Buffett, consistently the world’s richest man this last decade, said in numerous
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldPh0_zEykU">interviews with him and
    Bill Gates</a> that he never has meetings.</p><p>This is because many meetings
    are a waste of time. If you pay people $30 an hour and ten people show up for
    a useless meeting, they have taken $300 from you.</p><p>If you are an employee,
    <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/">Tim Ferriss</a>, author of <em>The 4 Hour
    Work Week</em>, has some great strategies for phasing out of meetings as an employee
    in his book.</p><p>Jason Fried, a multi-millionaire, has said in his book <em>Rework</em>
    to only invite necessary people to a meeting. He also recommends setting an objective
    at the start and a timer for how long the meeting goes for. It’s all about not
    wasting people’s time. As the boss, you’re paying for that time.</p><h3>Try stand-up
    meetings with a time limit and purpose</h3><p>If you do have meetings, try having
    stand-up meetings. <a href="https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/why-you-should-stand-up-in-meetings">Billionaire
    Richard Branson has ten-minute stand-up meetings</a>. He says this is because:</p><ul><li><p>It
    emphasizes real communication.</p></li><li><p>It makes it quicker to get to business
    and seal a deal.</p></li><li><p>It wastes less time.</p></li><li><p>No one nods
    off.</p></li><li><p>Decisions are made quicker.</p><blockquote><p><em>“While some
    circumstances call for workshops and more elaborate presentations, it’s very rare
    that a meeting on a single topic should need to last more than 5–10 minutes.”</em><em>-Richard
    Branson</em></p></blockquote></li></ul><p>A 1999 study from the Journal of Applied
    Psychology found that sit-down meetings were <strong>34% longer</strong> than
    stand-up meetings but produced no better decisions.</p><p>Researchers at Washington
    University in St. Louis found that stand-up meetings <strong>produced far better
    outcomes</strong> than sit-down meetings. In <em>Social Psychological &amp; Personality
    Science</em>, they found that stand-up meetings led to better collaboration, more
    engagement, less possessiveness, and more problem-solving creativity.</p><h3>Try
    a walking meeting</h3><p><a href="https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/why-you-should-stand-up-in-meetings">Richard
    Branson said he prefers walking meetings</a> for the reasons listed above. Also,
    seeing running waters from rivers or oceans makes him more creative.</p><h2>10.
    Don’t Under-Emphasize the Basics: Exercise, Eat Right, and Read</h2><p>This one
    is more from finding obvious common themes from millionaires, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUy72ErzGYw">Arnold
    Schwarzenegger</a>, Gary Vaynerchuk, and Tony Robbins. These are basic, common
    themes that are simple to do, but that few do.</p><p>Basic fundamental habits
    are most easily overlooked because they’re too easy. Yet everyone is too lazy
    to actually do them consistently.</p><p>Most multi-millionaires do most, if not
    all, of these:</p><ul><li><p>Stay fully hydrated</p></li><li><p>Eat nutritious
    food</p></li><li><p>Exercise daily, especially cardio (aerobic exercise)</p></li><li><p>Wake
    up before six am</p></li><li><p>Meditate</p></li><li><p>Read the right things</p></li><li><p>Journal</p></li><li><p>Daily
    goal-setting</p></li></ul><p>The most important are probably exercise, nutrition,
    and goal setting. I’d throw in meditation as a close fourth.</p><p>Don’t let it
    overwhelm you. Just improving on one of these puts you ahead. The average person
    doesn’t bother to improve any of these.</p><h2>11. Realize You Control Your Time
    and Simplify Your Calendar</h2><p>Here’s a bonus tip. Warren Buffett has said
    in many interviews that he keeps his calendar very simple. In the Charlie Rose
    interview below, he shows his actual calendar, which has only three to-do activities
    for the month.</p><p>Bill Gates was stunned when he learned about this from Buffet.
    Before he met him, he was at the whim of whoever wanted his time. Warren taught
    him that <strong>you are in charge of your time, not someone else.</strong></p><p>Bill
    still maps out every minute of his day to control his productivity, but is more
    thoughtful with what he chooses to put on there. As you can tell, there are different
    styles based on your preferences. But there are universal mindsets that you should
    still have.</p><p>Warren has an infinite amount of things he *could *do. But by
    focusing on an amount he can count with his fingers for the month, it clears out
    all the low-impact, distracting activities he should de-prioritize.</p><h2>I Challenge
    You to Take Action Now</h2><p>I want to challenge you to start doing one of these
    more right now. For me, I will start with fewer meetings and work on the others.</p>'

  :title: This 2-Step 10-Minute Exercise Creates Immediate Self-Awareness
  :content: '<p>This 2-Step 10-Minute Exercise Creates Immediate Self-Awareness</p><h3>“Imagination
    is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know
    and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever
    will be to know and understand.”―Albert Einstein</h3><p>Self-knowledge is important.
    But self-<em>imagination</em> is far more compelling and powerful. Actually, being
    highly imaginative is how you become self-aware.</p><p>You never actually have
    an objective perspective of yourself. Instead of trying to be objective, you should
    seek to be imaginative.</p><p>Even your memory is imagined and not objective.
    Yet, as children, we are trained to not be imaginative, which stops us from developing
    powerful memories and powerful futures. As Tony Buzan said, <em>“Children are
    trained to think linearly instead of imaginatively; they are taught to read slowly
    and carefully, and are discouraged from daydreaming. They are trained to reduce
    the use and capacity of their brain.”</em></p><p>The more imaginative you can
    be about yourself, about what you learn, and about your future, the more creative
    control you have over these things.</p><p>Your brain functions best when you use
    your imagination; when you combine both your left and right brains; when you engage
    all of your senses; when you exaggerate things and are playful.</p><p>In his <a
    href="http://www.ted.com/talks/stuart_brown_says_play_is_more_than_fun_it_s_vital?language=en">TED
    talk</a>, Stuart Brown said, <em>“Play leads to brain plasticity, adaptability,
    and creativity… Nothing fires up the brain like play.” *Similarly, Greg McKeown
    said in Essentialism, *“Very successful people see play as essential for creativity.”</em></p><p>The
    more creative you are, the more successful you can become. The more imaginative
    you are, the better your brain will operate.</p><p>When you allow yourself to
    be more imaginative about yourself, you will be blown away by how much *faster
    and more effectively *you can learn. You’ll be blown away by how flexible your
    identity and capabilities are. You’ll realize that your brain and memory have
    seemingly infinite capacity and that you’re living far beneath your potential.</p><p>For
    starters, here’s a quick 10-minute exercise that will begin your process of re-creating
    your life, surroundings, skills, and world.</p><h2><strong>Step 1: Mind Map Yourself
    (5 Minutes)</strong></h2><blockquote><p>“Through using our memory to its fullest
    we can unlock the vast reservoir of human potential that isn’t currently being
    used.” — Tony Buzan</p></blockquote><p>Mind mapping is a skill used by many of
    the world’s best learners. Rather than taking notes or jotting down your ideas
    in a linear fashion using only words, mind mapping taps into all of the senses
    of both the right and left brains.</p><p>Basically, with a mind map, you take
    out a blank piece of paper and draw a circle in the middle and put your name.
    Then draw lines going out from the circle and write down whatever categories of
    your life you want to have, such as health, money, relationships, achievements,
    spirituality.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/0*_uHdqkwvqWkjTW4v.jpg"
    alt=""></p><p>When creating a mind map of yourself, write down all of your dreams,
    ambitions, and characteristics.</p><p>Hold nothing back.</p><p>Also, rather than
    simply using words, it’s far more powerful to use images. Your brain stores colorful
    and even moving images much easier than static words.</p><p>The more imaginative
    you can be, the more powerful and memorable the your mind map will be.</p><p>Your
    identity is imagined. Your future identity is also imagined. So you might as well
    take creative control over the imagination-process. You might as well become brilliant
    at the imagination process. This will make your memory far more flexible and powerful,
    enabling you to more fully embrace new experiences and transform those experiences
    into growth.</p><p>Here’s how you can fold time. When you create a mind map of
    your future self in a highly imaginative and visual way, you create <em>memories
    of your future self.</em></p><p>The more emotional the memory the better, as emotion
    creates the context and feeling of the memory.</p><p>Zig Ziglar is famous for
    saying,* “You have to “Be” the right kind of person first, then you must “Do”
    the right things before you can expect to “Have” the things in life that really
    matter. Dad keeps it pretty simple — Be, Do, Have.”*</p><p>When you mind map your
    future self in a highly imaginative way, you fold time and bring your future self
    into the present. This will allow you into a new role and identity that can immediately
    act congruently with your goals.</p><p>For example, you may put on your mind map
    that you will be a millionaire. However, the regular behaviors involved in being
    a millionaire likely conflict with your current identity and behaviors. Therefore,
    you need to pull your future self into the present and begin <em>being</em> and
    acting as that person now.</p><p>Again, the more imaginative, visual, and emotionally-stimulating
    this written-process, the more engrained it will be into your memory. And your
    memory in large part shapes your identity and future.</p><h2><strong>Step 2: Write
    Your Own Obituary (5 Minutes)</strong></h2><blockquote><p>“While I thought that
    I was learning how to live, I have been learning how to die.” — Leonardo da Vinci</p></blockquote><p>Once
    you’ve mind mapped your future self, the next step is to write your own obituary.
    You can take 5 minutes or 50 minutes on this.</p><p>Either way, it is powerful
    to write out your obituary from the vantage point of you already being dead.</p><p>What
    would you like that obituary to say?</p><p>Again, be very imaginative.</p><p>The
    shocking part about life is how much it can bend itself to fit your mind, feelings,
    and imaginings.</p><p>A very smart question when considering your own obituary
    comes from billionaire, Peter Theil, who asked, <em>“How can you achieve your
    10 year plan in the next 6 months?”</em></p><p>Why does this question matter?
    Because it cuts through the noise like a hot knife cuts through butter.</p><p>You
    absolutely can achieve most of your wildest dreams in the next 6–12 months. You
    simply need to start living to die instead of dying to live. This is what Robin
    Sharma calls having a “death-bed” mentality. It means you never take another day
    for granted again. It means you bring extreme and powerful <em>enthusiasm</em>
    to everything you do.</p><p>Enthusiasm is contagious. It gives energy and life.
    When you wake up and bring enthusiasm to what you’re doing, your mind begins sparking
    with creative ideas and insights. Your doubts and fears begin to wash away. Productivity
    becomes automatic.</p><p>What will your obituary say?</p><p>Write it down and
    then put it on your wall right next to your visually stimulating mind map. This
    is how you create a transformational trigger that immediately causes a deep sense
    of <em>remembering.</em> In your day-to-day life, it’s easy to fall back into
    cycles. It’s easy to forget what you really want and what you stand for.</p><p>However,
    if you have a transformational trigger which immediately reminds you of the future
    you, then it can zap you into that role and identity in the here and now. Thus,
    not only will your emotionally-charged trigger remind you, but it will also transform
    and reshape you.</p><h2>A Lifetime State Of Play</h2><p>According to Strategic
    Coach founder, Dan Sullivan, life can and should be organized such that you live
    in a continual state of play.</p><p>How do you do this?</p><ul><li><p><strong>You
    never stop learning.</strong> Your brain needs all of the information it can get
    — however, garbage in, garbage out. Your life is a product of your standards and
    your brain is the product of the quality of information you put in.</p></li><li><p>*<em>You
    deepen your human relationships. *</em>Nothing is more important for the human
    brain than love. You could get all of the nutrition, oxygen, and information you
    need — but without love, your brain will hardly be able to process anything. However,
    when you have love, all inputs are amplified and expanded.</p></li><li><p><strong>You
    always make your future bigger than your past.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>You
    remove everything from your life that is keeping you stuck.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>You
    allow yourself to imagine something more compelling and exciting.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>You
    focus on “who” instead of “how.”</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>You allow yourself
    to want what you really want</strong>, and never operate from a state of “should”
    or “have to” again.</p></li></ul><p>When you give yourself permission to seek
    what you truly want, you immediately have far more energy, excitement, and enthusiasm
    about what you’re doing.</p><p>If something doesn’t excite you, then you’re not
    being imaginative enough about the game and how it’s being set up. Your future
    should be extremely juicy and compelling. It should even potentially scare you
    a little bit because it’s so amazing.</p><p>Charles Haanel, considered to be the
    father of modern self-improvement said,<em>“Remember that no matter what the difficulty
    is, no matter where it is, no matter who is affected, you have no patient but
    yourself; you have nothing to do but convince yourself of the truth which you
    desire to see manifest.”</em></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Where will you be in 6
    months from now?</p><p>How close can you get to achieving your 10-year plan in
    the next 6 months?</p><p>How imaginative will you be?</p><p>Are you willing to
    be bold?</p><p>Are you willing to be direct?</p><p>Are you willing to do what
    will actually work, rather than being emotionally-attached to the outcome and
    to your ego?</p><p>Are you willing to create a life that allows you a continual
    state of play and awe?</p><p>How much bigger is your future going to be than your
    past?</p><p>What will your obituary say?</p><p>Will you fold-time and begin living
    your future today?</p><p><a href="https://benjaminhardy.com/">**Get the free 6-page

    every day. Only some will come into your awareness, however, and just a few will
    stick with you.</p><p>More often than not, it’s the little things that get to
    us.</p><p>Have you ever wondered why you can watch footage of a deadly car accident,
    learn it’s the fault of a drunk driver, feel upset for a few moments, and then
    carry on with your day? Or why, when you see your kiss-up co-worker trying to
    charm your supervisor, you become so irritated that you’re unable to think about
    anything else for the next three days?</p><p>We often have strong—if not irrational—reactions
    to small, innocuous behaviors. Just as often, we have moderate—but not neutral—responses
    to major wrongdoings. We are often more animated when discussing an irritating
    family member than an unethical political policy with the potential to threaten
    our lives.</p><p>This is not to say we cannot recognize malice in the world. Rather,
    objectively inoffensive stimuli trigger deep-rooted responses. Often, this response
    presents itself as an overreaction.</p><p>These subtle, non-serious triggers that
    drive you absolutely crazy* *are not random. They get to you because they are
    facets of your own personality; they are, in fact, impulses you have suppressed.
    There’s a saying related to this: We love in others what we love in ourselves,
    and we cannot stand in others what we cannot see in ourselves.</p><p>I challenge
    you to make a list of absolutely everything that irritates you about other people.
    Not things that sadden or upset you, or situations that are legitimately problematic:
    I’m talking about the minute things that just rub you the wrong way, the things
    you mull over and obsess about, the things you simply can’t let go. I’m talking
    about tics, habits, and patterns of speech. I’m talking about personality traits
    and impulses and the way someone responds to a challenge.</p><p>Maybe it’s someone
    who drags their feet and lacks initiative. Maybe you believe a relative is entitled,
    or too dependent on someone else for support. Maybe it’s the way someone disengages
    from a conversation abruptly when you’re mid-sentence. Maybe it’s the way someone
    talks over others, or cuts you off when you’re trying to answer a question.</p><p>Maybe
    it’s the way someone parents. Maybe it’s the way they run their business. Maybe
    it’s the way they condescend to you. Maybe it’s the way they insult your appearance
    or capabilities.</p><p>Whatever it is, write it down. Then take a careful look
    at that list. Next to each point, consider a way in which you are guilty of the
    same behavior or resist the impulse* *to engage in that behavior.</p><p>Maybe
    you are distraught over someone insulting your intelligence because you secretly
    think you’re smarter than they are. Maybe your friend’s vacation photos irritate
    you because you also want your life to look perfect. Maybe you also humblebrag
    to your boss, but do so in the privacy of the conference room. Maybe you also
    talk over people and get distracted mid-conversation, because you assume your
    own thoughts and ideas are more important.</p><p>It’s hard to be this self-aware.
    It’s impossible for most people. But it is really important to understand that
    we typically condemn the innocuous actions and traits of others that are also
    a part of ourselves. If we can take a step back and look at what gets to us, we
    can pretty quickly identify that we are responding to traits within our own mental
    and emotional capacities.</p><p>We give consequence to those who act on impulses
    we deny and resist. If we were to affirm these impulses, we would also have to
    affirm ourselves—and most of the time there’s a good reason we don’t want to behave
    the way they do.</p><p>We are often guilty of the very behaviors that upset us
    most in others; we just don’t realize we are doing it. We are all prone to being
    a bit of a toady, a bit of a narcissist, a bit of an overachiever, a bit of a
    show-off, a bit dependent, a bit needy.</p><p>The most acute and stunning tool
    for self-awareness is not how we see ourselves, but how we see others. If we can
    see ourselves in others, for better or for worse, we can gain compassion, understand
    that the issue is ours to resolve, and inch closer to becoming the people we most
    deeply want—and do not want—to be.</p>'

  :title: Lessons learned from my journey as a self-taught developer
  :content: <p>The path of the self-taught developer is tough and filled with uncertainty.
    There is no straight line from newbie to career programmer. Because of this, I
    believe all self-taught developers have a unique story to tell.</p><p>In this
    article, I’ve shared a few stories and lessons I’ve learned from my time teaching
    myself programming. Hopefully reading about my experiences will help you reflect
    on your past and motivate you moving forward.</p><h2>Focus on the process</h2><p>When
    I first started learning to program, I never had the intention of making a career
    out of it. I just wanted to make a specific app.</p><p>My journey started when
    I was a senior in college. I just finished Richard Branson’s biography and I was
    probably reading too much TechCrunch. I was pumped full of entrepreneurial energy.</p><p>I
    was constantly reading about how college kids were receiving massive amounts of
    investment for their mobile app ideas. I thought I could be one of those college
    kids.</p><p>One day, while walking in-between classes, an app idea hit me. I quickly
    became convinced that I’d found the next big thing.</p><p>I was consumed by the
    idea and stopped paying attention to lectures. My excitement for the app idea
    quickly grew to the point where I felt I needed to take action.</p><p>There was
    one big problem. My idea was a mobile app and I didn’t know anyone who could build
    mobile apps.</p><p>So I thought, “what the hell, how hard could programming be?”
    I was losing interest in my major and I was spending a lot of time playing Xbox.
    I could put some of my free time towards building out my mobile app idea.</p><p>Sometimes
    being naive helps you take action when you normally wouldn’t.</p><p>I was a college
    student with no programming, business, or design experience trying to learn Android
    so I could build a complex mobile app. I guess that’s what you get when you mix
    a big idea with the Silicon Valley hype machine.</p><p>I wish I could tell you
    things went well from here.</p><p>I bought a few books on Android development
    and spent countless hours in my room trying to duct-tape my app together. I didn’t
    care how the app worked, I just wanted a finished product.</p><p>Time went on
    and the app turned into a Frankenstein of copy and pasted code. The app didn’t
    have many features and it barely ran without crashing.</p><p>It wasn’t until I
    accidentally got into a Computer Science class that I realized that I should focus
    more on actually trying to learn software development.</p><p>My inability to program
    lead me to abandon my initial app idea. I’d come to the realization that I wasn’t
    going to make the next big thing, at least not yet.</p><p>Over time I corrected
    my behavior and took learning more seriously. I started to enjoy programming and
    eventually started a career as a software developer.</p><h2>Take Away</h2><p>My
    big app idea consumed me for a long time. It put my focus on the end result rather
    than the process of getting there.</p><p>When you get too focused on the end result,
    you start taking shortcuts. Shortcuts might lead some short-term progress but
    in the long run, your lack of knowledge will always catch up to you.</p><p>It’s
    important to remember that learning anything big, like programming, requires many
    small steps. Each step will need to be treated with care.</p><p>Learning new things
    is like building a house. You start with the foundation and build up. If the foundation
    is faulty the whole thing will crumble down sooner or later.</p><p>Sometimes building
    a strong foundation requires you to slow down. There’s no shame in going slow.
    The people who understand the basics the first time will end up getting ahead
    of the people who have to go back and relearn them.</p><p>There’s an old Chinese
    proverb that goes:</p><blockquote><p>It is better to take many small steps in
    the right direction than to make a great leap forward only to stumble backward.</p></blockquote><p>It’s
    not how fast you can do something, it’s how slowly you can do it correctly.</p><p>I
    was a perfect example. From the outside, it might’ve looked like I was a programming
    whiz kid. In reality, I couldn’t build an app to save my life.</p><p>Focus on
    the process and you will surprise yourself with how much progress you make each
    day.</p><h2>Stack Overflow is awesome (and dangerous)</h2><p>As I was building
    my killer app, Stack Overflow became my best friend.</p><p>Anytime I got stuck
    I would try to craft together a perfect question to ask the Stack Overflow community.
    I averaged a few questions a day.</p><p>Not only would I post questions, but I
    would also treat the answers on Stack Overflow as Gospel. I would spend a crazy
    amount of time scouring the site to try to find an exact chunk of code that would
    fix my problem.</p><p>When I found a suitable answer, I would copy and paste it
    right into my codebase and try to make it work with my existing code. I spent
    little time trying to understand the code I was adding.</p><p>I made brute-force
    trial and error a new art form.</p><p>This process went on for a while until eventually,
    I wised up and realized the flaws of my approach.</p><h2>Take Away</h2><p>Stack
    Overflow is a blessing and a curse. It’s great at helping you solve problems;
    however, if you aren’t careful, you can quickly become dependent on the website.</p><p>Sometimes
    the website is too good at solving problems. It creates a false sense of confidence
    that can lead to more headaches down the road.</p><p>Stack Overflow shows you
    how to get something to work but it doesn’t usually explicitly tell you why it
    works.</p><p>Understanding the how is important. Bugs need to be fixed and code
    needs to run.</p><p>However, understanding why something works is what’s going
    to help you apply the knowledge again in the future.</p><p>It’s like the quote…</p><blockquote><p><em>“Give
    a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him
    for a lifetime.</em></p></blockquote><p>Copy and pasting code from Stack Overflow
    is like giving a man a fish. Understanding why a snippet of code works is like
    teaching a man to fish.</p><p>There’s nothing wrong with copying and pasting code.
    We all do it. It’s only a problem when it becomes a crutch and stunts our growth
    as a developer.</p><p>The thing I had to learn the hard way was that it’s impossible
    to learn anything if the answers are constantly given to you. There are no short-cuts
    in the learning process.</p><p>When you’re stuck, attempt to solve your coding
    problem at least a few times before going to Google.</p><p>When you find yourself
    copying and pasting code, spend a little time trying to understand the code snippet
    before moving on.</p><h2>Find experienced help</h2><p>The first thing I did after
    I decided I wanted to learn programming was buy two Android development books.</p><p>At
    the start, I followed the exercises in the books closely and worked through the
    example projects. However, I quickly got frustrated with the progress I was making
    following the book and decided to go off and figure out how to program on my own.</p><p>As
    you’ve read above, that slowly resulted in disaster.</p><p>I spent countless hours
    isolated in my room trying to figure out simple programming problems. I was getting
    stuck on every new line of code and it didn’t feel like I was making much progress.</p><p>I
    was helplessly stuck and my life was a cocktail of doubt, frustration, and an
    overwhelming feeling of being lost.</p><p>To make matters worse, I had the bright
    idea to start using a massive C library called FFMPEG. My app needed to edit videos,
    so I thought it was a good idea to utilize the library’s robust functionality.</p><p>It
    wasn’t my smartest move, considering at the time, I could barely get my Android
    app working.</p><p>I wasted a lot of time trying to read the C code and figuring
    out how I could use it in my app. I struggled to even get the library imported
    into my Android project. The Android code and C code didn’t want to play nice.</p><p>After
    many hours of getting nowhere, I eventually became frustrated and abandoned the
    library.</p><p>Around the same time as the FFMPEG debacle, I signed up for an
    Object Oriented Programming class. I’m honestly not sure how I got in. I later
    found out that I was the only non-Computer Science major in the class. I think
    there was a bug in the enrollment software.</p><p>The first assignment was to
    build a Blackjack program. I’d been teaching myself programming for 5–6 months
    at this point, and I felt somewhat confident with my skills.</p><p>I finished
    the assignment and felt good about my work.</p><p>It didn’t take long for that
    feeling to fade.</p><p>My whole program was written in one huge method. Just about
    everyone else in the class was able to pick up on the fact that the program needed
    to be separated into classes.</p><p>Not good.</p><h2>Take Away</h2><p>Luckily,
    the classwork and guidance from the teacher allowed me to take a step back from
    my Android app and reflect on my programming abilities. I started to value learning
    and reigned back my desires to make a completed app.</p><p>I’ve now come to realize
    that if I would’ve spoken to just <strong>one</strong> experienced developer in
    those early days, they would’ve seen what I was doing, set my priorities straight,
    and talked some sense into me. They would’ve helped me correct my path when I
    was going down useless dead ends (like trying to work with FFMPEG).</p><p>Instead,
    I isolated myself from the world partially because I felt like there wasn’t anyone
    who could help me.</p><p>Isolation is a double-edged sword. On one side, it helps
    you focus on the task at hand. On the flip side, it removes you from the world
    starving you of crucial feedback.</p><p>There were a lot of ways I could’ve found
    help. I could’ve tried to find a professor/student at the university with Android
    experience or looked to the local community for help. I also could’ve tried finding
    an online Android community.</p><p>Experienced developers are like a compass.
    They won’t get you to your destination but they will make sure you are pointed
    in the right direction. Their help can often be the difference between success
    and failure.</p><p>Make sure you seek out guidance wherever you can find it. It
    will save you time and frustration down the road.</p><h2>Craft your environment</h2><p>This
    might be the only thing I felt like I did right when I was teaching myself programming.</p><p>Throughout
    my life, I’ve been really bad at studying for tests or doing my homework at home.
    There are just too many distractions at any given moment. I would often try to
    find refuge in libraries or coffee shops.</p><p>Luckily I applied this rule when
    I was teaching myself programming.</p><p>I ended up becoming a regular at a few
    local coffee shops. I preferred coffee shops over other study locations because
    they provided some variety and it’s easy to hide (easy access to caffeine doesn’t
    hurt either).</p><p>If I was studying at home, I made sure my door was shut and
    my roommates knew not to disturb me for a certain period of time.</p><p>Regardless
    of where I was, I would make sure my music was loud enough so I couldn’t hear
    what was going on around me.</p><p>I can’t say I was perfect at finding a distraction-free
    work environment but I was able to succeed a majority of the time.</p><h2>Take
    Away</h2><p>Having the right work environment is often an overlooked part of learning.</p><p>Focus
    is a foundational component of memory and skill acquisition. When you try to learn
    something new, the strength of the learning is directly linked to the intensity
    of your focus. When your focus is weak, new information will be less sticky which
    will result in slower learning and more time studying.</p><p>Your work environment
    should be distraction-free and should allow for long uninterrupted stretches of
    focus. Even with COVID-19 making it difficult to work remotely, there are still
    actions you can take to design your learning environment.</p><p>Here are a few
    things you can do:</p><ul><li><p>Find a location where people won’t interrupt
    you</p></li><li><p>Put your phone in airplane mode</p></li><li><p>Use some sort
    of timed website blocker for social media and news sites</p></li><li><p>Wear headphones
    and listen to non-distracting music (preferably a long playlist so you don’t have
    to constantly switch songs)</p></li><li><p>Avoid TV or other highly stimulating
    surroundings</p></li><li><p>Have a notebook nearby to write down any tasks or
    ideas that pop into your head</p></li><li><p>Make it known to the people around
    you that you don’t want to be disturbed</p></li></ul><p>Only you can decide where
    and how to craft your environment. But make sure you do, because it’s worth it.</p><h2>Get
    out into the world and meet people</h2><p>Landing my first programming job was
    sort of a random occurrence.</p><p>I just moved to Omaha, Nebraska and I had around
    a year of self-taught development under my belt.</p><p>I knew very few people
    in Omaha, so I searched <a href="http://meetup.com/">Meetup.com</a> to try and
    find other people interested in Android development. I found a Meetup focused
    on mobile development which covered both iOS and Android development and I decided
    to go.</p><p>Going to that first meeting was nerve-racking. I spent around 10
    minutes in my car at the venue deciding if I should go in or drive off.</p><p>I
    was intimidated. I wasn’t confident of my programming skills and I knew everyone
    at the Meetup had much more experience than I did.</p><p>I finally said, screw
    it and went inside.</p><p>I’m glad I did.</p><p>I started to attend regularly
    and during one Meetup, not too long after I moved to Omaha, I met a recruiter
    who was looking for an Android contractor. We talked for a while and I got an
    interview for the job later that week.</p><p>Before the interview, I felt confident.
    During the interview, I was a deer in the headlights.</p><p>The interviewer was
    talking about the project I’d be working on and it all went right over my head.
    I tried to stay engaged but they could tell it was out of my range.</p><p>After
    the interview, they asked me to hang-out for an hour so I could talk to someone
    else. Knowing I blew it, I walked around downtown trying to clear my head.</p><p>I
    ended up interviewing with someone else at the company, and shortly after, they
    offered me an internship.</p><p>I was so shocked that after I signed all the paperwork
    and got my work laptop running, I went over to the CEO and asked if it was a paid
    internship or not.</p><p>The internship turned into a full-time job and I started
    my career as a software developer.</p><h2>Take Away</h2><p>When you are self-taught,
    people are not going to come and seek you out. You will need to find opportunities
    for yourself.</p><p>Graduates of four-year universities and code schools have
    the advantage of leveraging their school’s network when finding a job. Self-taught
    developers don’t have this luxury.</p><p>Self-taught developers will need to go
    out into the world and build their networks themselves.</p><p>Cold calling employers
    and sending out resumes can work. However, I’ve found people like hiring people
    who are close to them in their social network.</p><p>Websites like <a href="http://meetup.com/">Meetup.com</a>
    are great for finding monthly programming specific groups. Even in a pandemic,
    there are still many virtual Meetups that are very informative and beneficial.</p><p>There
    are also other Slack channels or Discord communities that you can leverage to
    make meaningful relationships. You can also try reaching out to various people
    in your area and ask to have a quick 15-minute virtual coffee with them.</p><p>Do
    what you can to build up the nerve to reach out and talk with people. Be friendly
    and talk to them about your experiences. Make sure people know of your long-term
    goal of finding a job.</p><p>Put yourself in situations where something positive
    might happen. You can’t win a raffle if you never buy a ticket.</p><p>Consider
    any opportunity that comes your way, because even if it looks like a dead-end,
    it has the potential to lead to something bigger.</p><p>My internship was a huge
    pay-cut to the other offers I had at the time. However, I knew if I worked hard
    it would be an opportunity for me to break into the tech industry.</p><p>The key
    is to think of job opportunities in the long-term. Internships or part-time jobs
    might not give you your desired salary upfront but they might open up doors in
    the future.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can see, I made a lot of mistakes
    in my journey of becoming a self-taught developer.</p><p>Teaching yourself to
    code is never a straight road. All our stories are unique.</p><p>The key is to
    keep going and to avoid getting discouraged when things aren’t going your way.</p><p>I
    encourage other self-taught developers to share their stories. Not only will they
    provide valuable insights, but they will also help shine a light on the unique
    paths we’ve taken.</p><p>Hopefully, my story and the lessons I learned will help
    you moving forward.</p><p><strong>Thanks for reading. If you want to hear about

  :title: Self-Driving Trucks Are Going to Hit Us Like a Human-Driven Truck
  :content: '<p>Self-Driving Trucks Are Going to Hit Us Like a Human-Driven Truck<center></p><h3>The
    imminent need for basic income in recognition of our machine-driven future</center></h3><p>Late
    last year, I took a road trip with my partner from our home in New Orleans, Louisiana
    to Orlando, Florida and as we drove by town after town, we got to talking about
    <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/10829791/Google-very-actively-working-on-self-driving-cars-project.html">the
    potential effects self-driving vehicle technology</a> would have not only on truckers
    themselves, but on all the local economies dependent on trucker salaries. Once
    one starts wondering about this kind of one-two punch to America’s gut, one sees
    the prospects aren’t pretty.</p><p>We are facing the decimation of entire small
    town economies, a disruption the likes of which we haven’t seen since <a href="http://guardianlv.com/2013/08/ghost-towns-and-memories-of-missouris-route-66/">the
    construction of the interstate highway system itself bypassed entire towns</a>.
    If you think this may be a bit of hyperbole… let me back up a bit and start with
    this:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*FAOTYaCoYpUhjiAe3sjofA.png"
    alt="Source: [NPR](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2015/02/05/382664837/map-the-most-common-job-in-every-state?)"><em>Source:
    <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2015/02/05/382664837/map-the-most-common-job-in-every-state?">NPR</a></em></p><p><strong>This
    is a map of the most common job in each US state in 2014.</strong></p><p>It should
    be clear at a glance just how dependent the American economy is on truck drivers.
    According to the American Trucker Association, <a href="http://www.alltrucking.com/faq/truck-drivers-in-the-usa/">there
    are 3.5 million professional truck drivers in the US</a>, and an additional 5.2
    million people employed within the truck-driving industry who don’t drive the
    trucks. That’s 8.7 million trucking-related jobs.</p><p>We can’t stop there though,
    because the incomes received by these 8.2 million people create the jobs of others.
    Those 3.5 million truck drivers driving all over the country stop regularly to
    eat, drink, rest, and sleep. Entire businesses have been built around serving
    their wants and needs. Think restaurants and motels as just two examples. So now
    we’re talking about millions more whose employment depends on the employment of
    truck drivers. But we still can’t even stop there.</p><p>Those working in these
    restaurants and motels along truck-driving routes are also consumers within their
    own local economies. Think about what a server spends her paycheck and tips on
    in her own community, and what a motel maid spends from her earnings into the
    same community. That spending creates other paychecks in turn. So now we’re not
    only talking about millions more who depend on those who depend on truck drivers,
    but we’re also talking about entire small town communities full of people who
    depend on all of the above in more rural areas. With any amount of reduced consumer
    spending, these local economies will shrink.</p><p>One further important detail
    to consider is that truck drivers are well-paid. They provide a middle class income
    of <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Transportation-and-Material-Moving/Heavy-and-tractor-trailer-truck-drivers.htm">about
    $40,000 per year</a>. That’s a higher income than <a href="http://www.whatsmypercent.com/">just
    about half</a> (46%) of all tax filers, including those of married households.
    They are also greatly comprised by those without college educations. Truck driving
    is just about the last job in the country to provide a solid middle class salary
    without requiring a post-secondary degree. Truckers are essentially the last remnant
    of an increasingly impoverished population once gainfully employed in manufacturing
    before those middle income jobs were mostly all shipped overseas.</p><p>If we
    now step back and look at the big national picture, we are potentially looking
    at well over 10 million American workers and their families whose incomes depend
    entirely or at least partially on the incomes of truck drivers, all of whom markedly
    comprise what is left of the American middle class.</p><p>So as long as the outlook
    for US trucking is rosy, we’re fine, right?</p><h3>The Short-Term Job Outlook
    of the American Trucker</h3><p>The trucking industry expects to see <a href="http://www.alltrucking.com/faq/truck-drivers-in-the-usa/">21%
    more truck driving jobs by 2020</a>. They also expect to see an increasing shortfall
    in drivers, with over 100,000 jobs open and unable to find drivers to fill them.
    Higher demand than supply of truckers also points to higher pay, so for at least
    the next five years, the future is looking great for truck drivers. The only thing
    that could put a damper on this would be if the demand for truck drivers were
    to say… drive off a sharp cliff.</p><blockquote><h1><em>That cliff is the self-driving
    truck.</em></h1></blockquote><p>The technology already exists to enable trucks
    to drive themselves. Google shocked the world when it announced its self-driving
    car it had already driven over 100,000 miles without accident. These cars have
    since driven over <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/the-view-from-the-front-seat-of-the-google-self-driving-car-46fc9f3e6088">1.7
    million miles and have only been involved in 11 accidents</a>, all caused by humans
    and not the computers. And this is <em>mostly within</em> metropolitan areas.</p><blockquote><p>“And
    as you might expect, we see more accidents per mile driven on city streets than
    on freeways; we were hit 8 times in many fewer miles of city driving.” — <em>Chris
    Urmson, director of Google’s self-driving car program</em></p></blockquote><p>So
    according to Google’s experience, the greater danger lies within cities and not
    freeways, and driving <em>between</em> cities involves even fewer technological
    barriers than within them. Therefore, it’s probably pretty safe to say driverless
    freeway travel is even closer to our future horizon of driverless transportation.
    How much closer? It has <em>already</em> happened.</p><blockquote><h1><strong><em>On
    May 6, 2015, the first self-driving truck hit the American road in the state of
    Nevada.</em></strong></h1></blockquote><p><center><iframe width="560" height="315"

    trucks are no longer the future. They are the present. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/05/worlds-first-self-driving-semi-truck-hits-road/">They’re
    here</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“AU 010.” License plates are rarely an object of attention,
    but this one’s special — the funky number is the giveaway. That’s why Daimler
    bigwig Wolfgang Bernhard and Nevada governor Brian Sandoval are sharing a stage,
    mugging for the phalanx of cameras, together holding the metal rectangle that
    will, in just a minute, be slapped onto the world’s first officially recognized
    self-driving truck.</p></blockquote><p>According to Daimler, these trucks will
    be in a decade-long testing phase, racking up over a million miles before being
    deemed fit for adoption, but the technology isn’t even anything all that new.
    There’s no laser-radar or LIDAR like in <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/14/5716468/i-took-a-ride-in-a-self-driving-car">Google’s
    self-driving car</a>. It’s just ordinary radar and cameras. The hardware itself
    is already yesterday’s news. They’re just the first ones to throw them into a
    truck and allow truckers to sit back and enjoy the ride, while the truck itself
    does all the driving.</p><p>If the truck needs help, it’ll alert the driver. If
    the driver doesn’t respond, it’ll slowly pull over and wait for further instructions.
    This is nothing fancy. This is not a truck version of KITT from Knight Rider.
    This is just an example of a company and a state government getting out of the
    way of technology and letting it do what it was built to do — <strong>enable us
    to do more with less</strong>. In the case of self-driving trucks, one big improvement
    in particular is fewer accidents.</p><blockquote><p>In 2012 in the US, 330,000
    large trucks were involved in crashes that killed nearly 4,000 people, most of
    them in passenger cars. About 90 percent of those were caused by driver error.</p></blockquote><p><strong>That’s
    like <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/911-death-statistics/">one and a half
    9/11s</a> yearly. Human-driven trucks kill people.</strong></p><p>Robot trucks
    will kill far fewer people, if any, because machines don’t get tired. Machines
    don’t get distracted. Machines don’t look at phones instead of the road. Machines
    don’t drink alcohol or do any kind of drugs or involve any number of things that
    somehow contribute to the total number of accidents every year involving trucks.
    For this same reasoning, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/11/21/would-air-travel-be-safer-without-pilots-steve-jurvetson-thinks-so/">pilots
    too are bound to be removed from airplanes</a>.</p><p><strong>Humans are dangerous
    behind the wheel of anything.</strong></p><p>Robot trucks also don’t need salaries
    — salaries that stand to go up because fewer and fewer people want to be truckers.
    A company can buy a fleet of self-driving trucks and never pay another human salary
    for driving. The only costs will be upkeep of the machinery. No more need for
    health insurance either. Self-driving trucks will also never need to stop to rest,
    for any reason. Routes will take less time to complete.</p><p>All of this means
    the replacement of truckers is inevitable. It is not a matter of “if”, it’s only
    a matter of “when.” So the question then becomes, how long until millions of truckers
    are freshly unemployed and what happens to them and all the rest of us as a result?</p><h3>The
    Long-Term Job Outlook of the American Trucker</h3><p>First, let’s look at the
    potential time horizons for self-driving cars. Tesla intends to release a software
    update <em>next month</em> that will turn on “autopilot” mode, immediately allowing
    all Tesla Model S drivers to be driven between <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/19/8257933/tesla-model-s-autopilot-release-date">“San
    Francisco and Seattle without the driver doing anything”</a>, in Elon Musk’s own
    words. The cars actually already have the technology to even drive from “parking
    lot to parking lot”, but that ability will remain unactivated by software.</p><p>Tesla-driven
    humans won’t be able to legally let their cars do all the driving, but who are
    we kidding? There will be Teslas driving themselves, saving lives in the process,
    and governments will need to catch up to make that driving legal. This process
    is already here in 2015. So when will the process end? When will self-driving
    cars conquer our roads?</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*kg2IBv4Rah6It0-u9_B4mA.png"

    and it’s all educated guesswork. So here are some other estimates:</p><ul><li><p>Navigant

    2035</strong>, sales of autonomous vehicles will reach 95.4 million annually,

    “<a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/fully-self-driving-cars-expected-by-2030-says-forecast">There
    should be nearly 54 million self-driving cars in use globally <strong>by 2035</strong>.</a>”</p></li><li><p>ABI
    Research: “<a href="https://www.abiresearch.com/press/half-of-new-vehicles-shipping-in-north-america-to-/">Half
    of new vehicles shipping in North America to have driverless, robotic capabilities

    2020</strong> we’re talking more autonomous drive capability. It’s going to be
    an evolutionary process and 2020 will be the first year to truly see some of these

    all of these estimates together, and we’re looking at a window of massive disruption
    starting *</em>somewhere between** <strong>2020 and 2030</strong>.*</h1></blockquote></li></ul><p>There
    is no turning the wheel in prevention of driving off this cliff either. Capitalism
    itself has the wheel now, and what the market wants, the market gets. Competition
    will make sure of it. Tesla and Google are not the only companies looking to develop
    autonomous vehicles. There are others.</p><p>A company named <strong>Veeo Systems</strong>
    is developing vehicles as small as 2-seaters to as large as 70-seat buses, and
    will be testing them <a href="http://observer.com/2015/03/self-driving-cars-will-be-in-30-u-s-cities-by-the-end-of-next-year/">in
    30 US cities by the end of 2016</a>.</p><blockquote><p>At 25 to 40 percent cheaper,
    the cost to ride the driverless public transit vehicles will be significantly
    less expensive than traditional buses and trains… The vehicles are electric, rechargeable
    and could cost as low as $1 to $3 to run per day.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-14/apple-said-to-be-working-on-electric-car-to-challenge-tesla">**Apple
    is also developing its own self-driving car</a>.**</p><blockquote><p><em>The project
    is code-named Titan and the vehicle design resembles a minivan, the Wall Street
    Journal reported… Apple already has technology that may lend itself to an electric
    car and expertise managing a vast supply chain. The company has long researched
    battery technology for use in its iPhones, iPads and Macs. The mapping system
    it debuted in 2012 can be used for navigation…</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/03/technology/innovationnation/uber-self-driving-cars/index.html">**And
    Uber is developing its own self-driving car</a>.**</p><blockquote><p><em>Uber
    said it will develop “key long-term technologies that advance Uber’s mission of
    bringing safe, reliable transportation to everyone, everywhere,” including driverless
    cars, vehicle safety and mapping services.</em></p></blockquote><p>It’s this last
    one that fully intends to transform the transportation landscape. Uber is going
    all-in on self-driving vehicles to the point it wants to <a href="http://citypaper.net/uberdriver/">entirely
    eliminate car ownership</a> as a 20th century relic.</p><blockquote><p>Travis
    Kalanick, the CEO and founder of Uber, said at a conference last year that he’d
    replace human Uber drivers with a fleet of self-driving cars in a second. “You’re
    not just paying for the car — you’re paying for the other dude in the car,” he
    said. “When there’s no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere
    becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.” That, he said, will “bring the cost below
    the cost of ownership for everybody, and then <strong>car ownership goes away</strong>.”</p></blockquote><p>That’s
    the potential of self-driving cars —<a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-rise-of-automated-cars-will-thousands-of-jobs-and-n-1702689348">**
    the outright extinction of car ownership</a>**. And with that, the elimination
    of entire industries built up around the existence of car ownership like: mechanics,
    car washes, parking, valets, body shops, rental companies, car insurance, car
    loans, and on and on. Even hugely expensive and capital intensive mass-transit
    infrastructure projects like streetcars and light rail can be dropped in favor
    of vastly cheaper on demand robotic “<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-self-driving-cars-could-solve-new-yorks-traffic-woes-2014-6">transportation
    clouds</a>”, and all those construction and maintenance jobs right along with
    it.</p><p>Big players are already in the game. There are huge savings to be found,
    huge profits to be created. Higher quality and safety is assured. Driverless vehicles
    are coming, and they are coming fast.</p><p>But again, what about <strong>trucks</strong>
    specifically?</p><p>Any realistic time horizon for self-driving trucks needs to
    look at horizons for cars and shift those even further towards the present. Trucks
    only need to be self-driven on highways. They do not need warehouse-to-store autonomy
    to be disruptive. City-to-city is sufficient. At the same time, trucks are almost
    entirely corporate driven. There are market forces above and beyond private cars
    operating for trucks. If there are savings to be found in eliminating truckers
    from drivers seats, <em>which there are</em>, these savings will be sought. It’s
    actually really easy to find these savings right now.</p><p>Wirelessly linked
    truck platoons are as simple as having a human driver drive a truck, with multiple
    trucks without drivers following closely behind. This not only saves on gas money
    (<a href="http://www.peloton-tech.com/about/">7% for only two trucks together</a>),
    but can immediately eliminate half of all truckers if for example 2-truck convoys
    became the norm. There’s no real technical obstacles to this option. It’s a very
    simple use of present technology.</p><p>Basically, the only real barrier to the
    immediate adoption of self-driven trucks is purely legal in nature, not technical
    or economic. With self-driving vehicles currently only road legal in a few states,
    many more states need to follow suit unless autonomous vehicles are made legal
    at the national level. And Sergey Brin of Google has estimated this could happen
    <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/10829791/Google-very-actively-working-on-self-driving-cars-project.html">**as
    soon as 2017</a>**. Therefore…</p><blockquote><h1><em>The answer to the big question
    of “When?” for self-driving trucks is that they can essentially hit our economy
    at *</em>any time*<em>.</em></h1></blockquote><h3>The Eve of Massive Social and
    Economic Disruption</h3><p>Main Street USA has already taken a big hit, <a href="https://medium.com/basic-income/how-we-can-transform-americas-broken-economic-system-to-work-for-everyone-ddba38fc328a">and
    increasingly so</a>, over the past few decades. Manufacturing has been shipped
    overseas to areas where labor is far cheaper because costs of living are far cheaper.
    Companies like Walmart have spread everywhere, concentrating a reduced labor force
    into one-stop shopping facilities requiring fewer total workers than what was
    needed with smaller, more numerous, and more widely spread Mom &amp; Pop type
    stores. Companies like Amazon have even further concentrated this even further
    reduced labor force into automated warehouse centers capable of obviating stores
    entirely and shipping directly to consumers.</p><p>All of the above means fewer
    ways of securing employment in fewer places, while commerce has become more geographically
    concentrated and access to money has become increasingly shifted away from the
    bottom and middle of the income spectrum towards the top.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Ecuvog60xd45Uu3m2Yoe5g.png"

    and that money not spent on wages and salaries instead stays in the hands of owners
    of capital, or is given in smaller amounts to lower-paid employees in lower-wage
    jobs. Inequality grows more and more extreme and our land of opportunity vanishes.

    TX — Source: <a href="http://www.rd.com/slideshows/ghost-town-pictures/view-all/">Reader’s
    Digest</a></em></p><p>The removal of truckers from freeways will have an effect
    on today’s towns similar to the effects the freeways themselves had on towns decades
    ago that had sprung up around bypassed stretches of early highways. When the construction
    of the interstate highway system replaced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_66">Route
    66</a>, things changed as drivers drove right on past these once thriving towns.
    The result was <strong>ghost towns</strong> like <a href="http://www.rd.com/slideshows/ghost-town-pictures/view-all/">Glenrio,
    Texas</a>.</p><blockquote><p>With the patience that carved the Grand Canyon over
    eons, nature reclaims Glenrio, where the clock stopped with the bypass of Route
    66. The replacement of Route 66 with a four-lane superhighway that allowed motorists
    to zip past rather than wander through ultimately allowed Glenrio to decline.</p></blockquote><p>With
    self-driving cars and trucks, here again we face the prospect of town after town
    being zipped past by people (if even present) choosing to instead just sleep in
    their computer-driven vehicles. Except this time, there is no new highway being
    made for businesses to relocate closer to and new towns to emerge along. This
    time, <a href="http://www.scottsantens.com/debunking-the-debunking-of-humans-need-not-apply-and-more-the-fallacy-of-the-luddite-fallacy">as
    is true of the effect of technology on jobs</a>, it’s different. This time, there’s
    no need for entire towns to even exist <em>at all</em>.</p><h3>The Road Left to
    Take</h3><p>As close as <a href="http://qz.com/403628/autonomous-cars-will-destroy-millions-of-jobs-and-reshape-the-economy-by-2025/">2025</a>
    — that is in a mere 10 years — our advancing state of technology will begin disrupting
    our economy in ways we can’t even yet imagine. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU">Human
    labor is increasingly unnecessary and even economically unviable compared to machine
    labor</a>. And yet we still insist on money to pay for what our machines are making
    for us. As long as this remains true, <a href="http://www.scottsantens.com/yeah-but-who-is-going-to-pay-for-it-basic-income-alan-watts">we
    must begin providing ourselves the money required to purchase what the machines
    are producing</a>.</p><p>Without a** technological dividend**, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/03/17/robert_reich_economic_redistribution_is_our_only_hope_partner/">the
    engine that is our economy will seize,</a> or we will fight against technological
    progress itself in the same way <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/luddites-definition-wrong-labor-technophobe">some
    once destroyed their machine replacements</a>. Without non-work income, we will
    actually fight to keep from being replaced by the technology we built to replace
    us.</p><p>Just as our roads a decade from now will be full of machine drivers
    instead of human drivers, a 21st century economy shall be driven by human <em>consumers</em>,
    not human workers, and these consumers must be freely given their purchasing power.
    If we refuse, if we don’t provide ourselves <a href="https://medium.com/working-life/why-should-we-support-the-idea-of-an-unconditional-basic-income-8a2680c73dd3">**a
    universal and unconditional basic income</a> **soon, the future is going to hit
    us like a truck — a truck driven solely by ourselves.</p><p>To allow this to happen
    would be truly foolish, for what is the entire purpose of technology but to free
    us to pursue all we wish to pursue? Fearing the loss of jobs shouldn’t be a fear
    at all. It should be welcomed. It should be freeing.</p><p>No one should be asking

    you instantly know who’s in charge and who’s in trouble.</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/d244e3fe7f10d684102c670b248018a1"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>After crashing the Batmobile and interrupting Bruce
    Wayne on his rogue mission, Superman tells him to ‘bury the bat’ and let it go,
    putting mercy before justice. Of course Batman doesn’t, swearing revenge.</p><p>Lately,
    I feel a lot like Superman in this scene. With a stern look on my face, I swoop
    in to try and fix other people’s mess, but don’t get much credit for it. This
    is a cause for concern, but not about those other people, about me.</p><p>A lot
    of us strive to become superhuman, but this pursuit has a shadow. It looms ever
    closer and if we don’t watch out, it’ll swallow us whole.</p><p>Despite our best
    intentions, self-improvement can make us worse.</p><h2>When Mindfulness Isn’t
    Optional</h2><p>Over the past three years, I’ve gotten really good at noticing
    things. Not just about myself, but others too. In fact, I now can’t <em>not</em>
    notice things.</p><p>I notice when 10 out of 10 people on the subway are on their
    phone, when the dude in front of me is switching only between his sports betting
    account and Tinder and when the guy four seats over wastes all his time instead
    of working. I notice people who are always late, always behind and always broke
    and I can pinpoint exactly what needs fixing.</p><p>Now, I finally noticed that
    all this noticing is driving me nuts. I’d love to say <em>“I don’t mind”</em>
    and mean it, but it’s never true. I do mind. I mind everything.</p><p>Mindfulness
    is a gift when it’s directed inward, but outward? Not so much. It’s a good thing
    to realize you’re biting your nails, but constantly observing other people’s behavior?
    That’s a curse.</p><p>Why?</p><h2>Comparison Is The Road To Madness</h2><p>Mark
    Twain remarked that “comparison is the death of joy.” But, and this is worse,
    it’s also the birth of misery.</p><p>Comparing ourselves is an instinct as fundamental
    as survival itself. If Gronk can outrun the bear, pick the right berries and get
    the pretty neanderthal lady, maybe you should be more like Gronk. In a modern
    society built mainly on and for individual freedom, however, this is useless.</p><p>And
    yet, every notice is a new chance to compare. He eats well, I should eat better.
    She wastes time, I’m more productive. Even if we rationally estimate our own abilities,
    comparing still hurts us, <a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(16)30300-2">an
    Oxford study</a> suggests:</p><blockquote><p>“The findings potentially have implications
    for social interactions in the workplace as well as clinical disorders such as
    depression.”</p></blockquote><p>Interesting, right? Confidence and clinical depression
    can have the same source: comparing yourself to others. Most of the time, the
    results of your comparisons don’t even matter.</p><p>You’ll land in a bad place
    anyway.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2160/1*XUAK-KBxlskMOvK5Gu4PDA.png"

    money, or getting up early, or if what they do matters. They, however, would never
    consider these choices poor. That label is pure judgement on my part.</p><p>The
    problem is that with so much mindfulness, millions of mini comparisons, judgement
    itself becomes a habit. This is a common side effect of self-improvement. Since
    it’s all about getting better, you’re left with only two opinions of other people:</p><ol><li><p>They’re
    better than you.</p></li><li><p>You’re better than them.</p></li></ol><p>Whichever
    one you settle on, you lose. This is self-improvement’s dark secret.</p><h2>The
    Price Of Self-Improvement</h2><p>When you constantly compare yourself and decide
    you’re worse, you spiral into depression. But what happens when you think you’re
    better?</p><p>Imagine you’re Superman. You don’t need to compare, you have actual
    proof: you can’t die, you know everything and you’re physically stronger than
    anyone. You’re the ultimate success in self-improvement.</p><p>Unlike most of
    us, Superman didn’t choose his superiority, but he paid the same price: loneliness.</p><p><a
    href="undefined">Sebastian Marshall</a> perfectly described it in <a href="http://sebastianmarshall.com/the-million-dollar-question">an
    essay</a> 6 years ago:</p><blockquote><p>You know what I think it is? You won’t
    be understood once you step off into the abyss. The more you do it, the more people
    won’t understand.The second guy I mentioned, the effort guy? He’s got coworkers
    right now he can commiserate with who understand him. The business idea I mentioned
    to him doesn’t exist right now and there’s a demand for it. His income is such
    that even with a low price point he could still make 2x-3x what he’s making now
    and fulfill a market need.But then what? Then he’s the only guy doing this thing.
    No commiseration. People won’t understand him as much. And the more you do that,
    the more people don’t understand. If you keep taking all those edges that no one
    else will, pretty soon your neighbors don’t understand you, can’t understand you.It’s
    just you.</p></blockquote><p>The higher you climb on the mountain, the thinner
    the air gets. More success, fewer fellow climbers, until you’re left with only
    one truth:</p><blockquote><h1>You’re the best, but you’re alone.</h1></blockquote><p>Medium
    is full of posts telling people how they can become the best. Be more creative,
    more productive, more aware. But once you achieve that, once you’re better, faster,
    stronger, how do you blend back in?</p><p>Even if you become superhuman, you’ll
    still spend your life among mortals. How do you deal with that? I see no posts
    about this issue.</p><p>We’re so worried about acquiring power — over our minds,
    our bodies, our time — that we forget learning how to use it responsibly to serve
    the world we live in.</p><p>And so, often, by the time we get it, we’re victims
    of our own success.</p><h2>Running From Mediocrity, But Where To?</h2><p>It all
    happens slowly, of course. One day you opt out of binge drinking, the next you
    tell your friends to get their shit together and two years later, you run your
    own dev shop while they extended yet another semester.</p><p>You notice, you compare
    and through the years, you silently collect millions of judgements until you conclude
    you’re alone. You might succeed in self-improvement, but fail in being human.</p><p>This
    is the dangerous path many of us are on. I know I am. I must find a way to turn
    off my comparison machine, because it’s been running too long already. That’s
    the big, wicked twist of the story.</p><p>In that scene from the beginning, I’m
    not Superman. I’m Batman.</p><p>A lot of us are. The frustration from the loneliness
    of our path makes us bitter, impatient, and angry. So we abandon our true mission,
    one comparison at a time, until we can retreat only into our lonely cave of judgment.
    Not despite, but <em>because</em> we come out on top.</p><p>You may feel you’re
    ready to pay the toll of self-improvement, but you still might not like who you
    turn into. We think we’re improving ourselves, when actually, we’re becoming the
    villain of our own story.</p><p>If you run away from mediocrity, but right into
    malice, what good does it do?</p><h2>On Sweeping</h2><p>For Clark Kent, the option
    to compare went out the window when he was a child. The moment he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HUtzDRMKrc">pushed
    the first school bus out of the river</a>, any doubts were gone: if he goes rogue,
    we all die. Lucky for us all, before putting on his cape, Superman turned his
    powers inward.</p><p>That’s what we must do and it’s much more important than
    how much power we have. The problem is neither other people’s indifference to,
    nor our obsession with self-improvement. It’s the comparison that stinks.</p><blockquote><h1>Be
    better for the sake of being a better you, not better than everyone else.</h1></blockquote><p>There’s
    not much to gain from Pomodoro timers and dollar cost averaging for the people
    who enjoy their lives precisely for the lack of those things. It just so happens
    that because I care about self-improvement, I care about <em>you</em>-improvement
    too. Because then we could nerd out together. But we can’t and so I feel lonely.</p><p>It
    is <em>my</em> duty to deal with that loneliness and make sure it doesn’t drag
    me down. There is no ‘other people’s mess’. Just <em>my</em> mess. Nothing to
    swoop in for. The dirt is in front of my own doorstep, waiting for me to sweep.</p><p>You
    have a dirty doorstep too. Only if we all sweep will our streets be clean.</p><h2>Superman
    Is Dead</h2><p>When the world asked him to, Superman <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CFrwHXYotI">turned
    himself in</a>. When the world asked him to, Superman <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPNmUY9dEG0">appeared
    in court</a>. Knowing full well the rules did not apply, he abided by them anyway,
    for the sake of the greater good.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2360/1*5h6TIHtk-8JXZwTuS21W5Q.png"
    alt="[Source](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2016/03/batman_v_superman_ending_and_more_explained_in_an_faq.html)"><em><a
    href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2016/03/batman_v_superman_ending_and_more_explained_in_an_faq.html">Source</a></em></p><p>In
    a sick twist of fate, meeting the renegade bat led to his doomsday. As the ultimate
    of human evolution, Superman paid the ultimate price. It’s what makes it so hard
    to get out of the trap: You can be a saint and still lose.</p><p>That’s why <a
    href="http://amzn.to/2hY9bjS">the movie</a> is beloved by hardcore fans, but commercially,
    <a href="http://deadline.com/2017/03/batman-v-superman-box-office-profit-2016-1202049201/">far
    from the success it should have been</a>. We don’t want to see the hero do everything
    right and then die. We know life’s not fair, but we hate to be reminded of this
    reality.</p><p>And so, as he tries to build a new team of heroes in a post-Superman
    world, Batman is too late when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfXPT9ywlEY">he
    realizes it was never his turn to judge</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Alfred</strong>:
    “You’ve got a team here!”<strong>Bruce Wayne</strong>: “Superman could bring this
    team together better than I ever could. His strength…”<strong>Alfred</strong>:
    “Doesn’t matter how strong you are or what abilities youmight have…”<strong>Bruce
    Wayne</strong>: “He was more human than I am.”— <em>Silence —</em><strong>Bruce
    Wayne</strong>: “He <em>lived</em> in this world. Fell in love, got a job. Despite
    all that power. The world needs Superman.”</p></blockquote><p>Finally, Batman
    learns a true hero is not defined by the superiority of his power, but by the
    times he chooses to wield it. This moment is called <a href="http://chadfowler.com/life,/weightloss/2011/03/15/the-harajuku-moment.html">a
    Harajuku Moment</a>. Coined by <a href="undefined">Chad Fowler</a>, <a href="undefined">Tim
    Ferriss</a> defined it in <a href="http://amzn.to/2juwiDb">*The 4-Hour Body</a>*:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s
    <strong>an epiphany that turns a nice-to-have into a must-have.</strong> There
    is no point in getting started until it happens. No matter how many bullet points
    and recipes I provide, you will need a Harajuku Moment to fuel the change itself.”</p></blockquote><p>We
    all need such a moment in our quest for self-improvement. You have to acknowledge
    you’re not a hero to start acting like one. I had mine when I read this quote
    in <a href="http://amzn.to/2ii5bi8">*The Daily Stoic</a> *by <a href="undefined">Ryan
    Holiday</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“When philosophy is wielded with arrogance and
    stubbornly, it is the cause for the ruin of many. Let philosophy scrape off your
    own faults, rather than be a way to rail against the faults of others.” — Seneca</p></blockquote><p>Superman
    is dead. We <em>must</em> become our own heroes, or his sacrifice was in vain.
    I don’t know where you’ll find your Harajuku Moment, but you need one. Until then,
    until we learn to use our powers, the best we can do is ask:</p><blockquote><h1>What
    would Superman do?</h1></blockquote><p>Most of the time, he would probably just
    keep sweeping.</p>'

  :title: The Secret To Your Self-Motivation Lies In This Surprising Science-Backed
    Habit
  :content: '<p><strong>Neuroscience has discovered the remarkably simple source for
    endless self-motivation.</strong></p><p>We can do anything we set our minds to.
    But sometimes it can feel like our brains are working against us when it comes
    to achieving our goals.</p><p>Plans to learn a new skill, get in shape, or <a
    href="http://www.lexioncapital.com/why-we-do-what-we-do-excellence-at-every-step-of-the-experience/">to
    save money and start a business</a>, keep getting pushed back in the hopes that
    Future You will handle it “someday.”</p><p>It’s a crippling behavioral cycle.
    In fact, in psychology, procrastination is classified as a form of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/self-sabotage">self-sabotage</a>.</p><p>But
    there’s good news. While learning how to become self-motivated may feel difficult
    or nebulous, the potential solution is remarkably simple, according to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brainsnacks/201506/could-be-the-one-real-secret-self-motivation">Psychology
    Today</a> and cognitive neuroscience.</p><p>In their findings, a psychology professor
    at Harvard University, Ron Siegel, suggested that the key to following through
    on motivation boils down to this: bring optimism and fun back into the picture.</p><p>This
    sounds a little hokey, right? After all, completing a term paper or your taxes
    isn’t exactly fun.</p><p>While this habit seems anything but scientific, the neurological
    reasons behind it aren’t.</p><h3>According to the research, the reason we procrastinate
    on our ambitions lies in our primal psychology:</h3><blockquote><h1>“Our modern
    brains are still wired up for the ancient evolutionary purpose of surviving in
    a dangerous <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/environment">environment</a>.
    Over a million years or so, we developed specialized neural structures that selectively
    tuned in to danger signals.”</h1></blockquote><p>So when the time comes for us
    to create and be productive, instead of focusing on the pleasurable and rewarding
    aspects of obtaining our goals, our brains dwell on the anxiety and fear that
    comes along with doing something new or putting ourselves out there, or daring
    to fail.</p><p>We go into survival mode and push away potentially uncomfortable
    situations. In fact, optimism and fun are relatively new concepts for our brain,
    evolutionarily speaking.</p><p>However, there are a few extremely easy methods
    you can do to make creating and achieving your dreams feel effortless and fulfilling:</p><h2><strong>Tip
    the scale in your favor</strong></h2><p>Siegel suggests one simple way to snap
    out of a self-motivation rut is to write out a list and get the joys of doing
    something to outweigh the initial pangs of getting started.</p><p>A simple two-columned
    pros and cons list will do just the trick. Yep, while doing that Excel spreadsheet
    at work might not be fun, you’ll realize that being able to enjoy your weekend
    without it hanging over your head is well worth it.</p><p>While this method is
    effective in itself, the next step is what really drives this technique home:</p><h2><strong>Visualize
    a full-body experience</strong></h2><p>As you write out your list, really try
    to visualize and conjure up the precise feelings and sensations that meeting your
    goal will bring you.</p><p>If your goal is to follow a healthier diet, for example,
    try to viscerally picture how you will feel from the results. Think about how
    you’ll have more energy, or better skin, or how you’ll protect yourself from heart
    disease.</p><p>Mentally walking yourself through the process of success and the
    joys and benefits it brings can teach your brain to be motivated by something
    other than fear.</p><p>Visualization is scientifically proven to increase your
    odds of successfully reaching your goals. In another article, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/flourish/200912/seeing-is-believing-the-power-visualization">Psychology
    Today</a> reports that “research has revealed that mental practices are almost
    effective as true physical practice, and that doing both is more effective than
    either alone.”</p><h2><strong>Reward your progress</strong></h2><p>For this one
    you might be thinking, “But I’m not a kid. I don’t need to be rewarded every time
    I do something.”</p><p>However, going back to Professor Siegel’s point, one of
    the most critical aspects of sustainable self-motivation is pleasure and joy,
    and a reward system is a fantastic way to help accomplish this.</p><p>Not only
    is rewarding yourself for reaching goals a good self-care technique, it also changes
    the chemistry of our brains and can make us more motivated.</p><p>In a <a href="http://blog.idonethis.com/the-science-of-motivation-your-brain-on-dopamine/">study</a>
    that compared motivated people’s brains to lazy people’s brains, dopamine levels
    in a certain area of the brain played a large role in people’s ability to be self-motivated.
    Turns out dopamine is released in anticipation of a reward, and rewarding yourself
    for accomplishments can help you stay on track.</p><h2>Choose the right rewards</h2><p>Just
    because positive motivation works, don’t make the mistake of self-sabotaging your
    wins with counter-productive prizes, like spending lavishly. As <a href="http://lifehacker.com/reward-yourself-with-things-that-get-you-closer-to-your-1760422979">LifeHacker
    </a>put it, “if the rewards you give yourself undermine the goal itself, it only
    serves to set you back.”</p><p>Remember, <a href="http://www.ellekaplan.com/why-start-investing-early/">investing
    in yourself is the greatest gift you can give yourself</a>. The new “I deserve
    it” should be something that continues to reward you for years, rather than punishing
    you after the novelty wears off.</p><p>Everything from taking an exciting class
    to setting money aside for future endeavors can be fun — yet productive — ways
    to stay self-motivated. You’re doing something great for yourself by <a href="http://www.ellekaplan.com/how-to-create-financial-freedom/">investing
    in your future</a>. That is something to feel fantastic about!</p><h2>Celebrate
    the tiny wins</h2><p>Like most people on the pathway to success, you probably
    have major — hopefully audacious — long-term goals that you’re tackling. But as
    you probably know, these huge aspirations <a href="https://medium.com/life-learning/the-biggest-myth-behind-success-6e88af6c20c#.j8x4zctvu">won’t
    get accomplished overnight</a>.</p><p>That’s why you should find the time to make
    a symbolic fist pump every day. As <a href="http://tech.co/about-tech-cocktail">Tech.Co
    </a>co-founder Frank Gruber put it, “This is a journey — a hard one — and the
    only way to make it sustainable and bearable is if you actually acknowledge your
    small successes along the way.”</p><p>By celebrating those tiny wins, you’ll find
    a much-needed daily dose of self-motivation.</p><p>As long as you’re focusing
    on the fun, rewarding, sensory experiences of accomplishing your goals, you *will
    *get through the hard work eventually.</p><h3>Call to action</h3><p>If you liked

    of this article on YouTube</h3><p><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MD3R9yatou0"
    frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p><p>We were hosting a Meetup
    on robotics in Australia and it was question time.</p><p>Someone asked a question.</p><p>“How
    do I get into artificial intelligence and machine learning from a different background?”</p><p>Nick
    turned and called my name.</p><p>“Where’s Dan Bourke?”</p><p>I was backstage and
    talking to Alex. I walked over.</p><p>“Here he is,” Nick continued, “Dan comes
    from a health science background, he studied nutrition, then drove Uber, learned
    machine learning online and has now been with Max Kelsen as a machine learning
    engineer for going on a year.”</p><p>Nick is the CEO and Co-founder of Max Kelsen,
    a technology company in Brisbane.</p><p>I stood and kept listening.</p><p>“He
    has documented his journey online and if you have any questions, I’m sure he’d
    be happy to help.”</p><p>The questions finished and I went back to the food.</p><p>Ankit
    came over. He told me about the project he was working on to use machine learning
    to try and understand student learning better. He was combining lecture attendance
    rates, time spent on the online learning portal, quiz results, plus a few other
    things. He’d even built a front-end web portal to interact with the results.</p><p>Ankit’s
    work inspired me. It made me want to do better.</p><p>Then a few more people started
    coming over and asking questions about how to get into machine learning. All from
    different fields.</p><p>This is the hard part. I still see myself as a beginner.</p><p>But
    the best mentor is someone who’s 1–2 years in front of you. Someone who has just
    been through what you’re about to go through. Any longer and the advice gets fuzzy.
    You want it when it’s fresh.</p><p>My brother is getting into machine learning.
    Here’s what I’ve been saying to him (and myself if I were to start again).</p><h2>A)
    Get some Python foundations (3–4 months)</h2><p>The language doesn’t really matter.
    It could be R, Java, Python, whatever. What matters is picking one and sticking
    with it.</p><p>If you’re starting out, you’ll find it hard to go wrong with Python.</p><p>And
    if you want to get into applied machine learning, code is compulsory.</p><p>Pick
    a foundations course from online and follow it through for a couple of months.
    Bonus points if it’s geared towards teaching data science at the same time. <a
    href="http://bit.ly/datacampmrdbourke">DataCamp</a> is great for this.</p><p>It’ll
    get hard at times but that’s the point. Learning a programming language is like
    learning another language and another way of thinking at the same time.</p><p>But
    you’ve done it before. Remember when you were 3? Probably not. But people all
    around you were using words and sounds you’d never heard before. Then after a
    while, you started using them too.</p><h2>B) Start making things when you’re not
    ready</h2><p>Apply what you’ve learned as soon as you can.</p><p>No matter how
    many courses you’ve completed, you’ll never be 100% ready.</p><p>Don’t get lured
    into completing more courses as a sign of competence.</p><p>This is one thing
    I’d change if I went back and started again.</p><p>Find a project of your own
    to work on and learn through being wrong.</p><p>Back to your 3-year-old self.
    Every 3rd word you said would’ve been wrong. No sentence structure, no grammar
    either. Everything just came out.</p><h2>C) There’s a lot out there so reduce
    the clutter</h2><p>There are plenty of courses out there. All of them great.</p><p>It’s
    hard to find a bad one.</p><p>But here’s the thing. Since there are so many, it
    can be hard to choose. Another trap which can hold you back.</p><p>To get around
    this, I made <a href="http://bit.ly/AIMastersDegree">my own AI Masters Degree</a>.
    My own custom track to follow.</p><p>You can copy it if you want. But I encourage
    you to spend a few days doing research of your own and seeing what’s best for
    you.</p><p>As a heads up, three resources I’ve found most aligned to what I do
    day-to-day are, the <a href="https://amzn.to/2GormNb">Hands-On Machine Learning
    Book</a>, the <a href="http://course18.fast.ai/ml">fastai Machine Learning course</a>
    and the <a href="http://bit.ly/courseraDS">Applied Data Science with Python course
    on Coursera</a>.</p><p>Bookmark these for after you’ve had a few months Python
    experience.</p><h2>D) Research is necessary but pointless if you can’t apply it</h2><p>You’ll
    see articles and papers coming out every day about new machine learning methods.</p><p>Ignore
    them.</p><p>There’s no way to keep up with them all and it’ll only hold you back
    from getting your foundations set.</p><p>Most of the best machine learning techniques
    have been around for decades. What’s changed has been an increase in computing
    power and the availability of data.</p><p>Don’t be distracted by the new.</p><p>If
    you’re starting out, stick to getting your foundations first. Then expand your
    knowledge as your project requires.</p><h2>E) A little every day</h2><p>3-year-old
    you was a learning machine (a machine learner?).</p><p>In a couple of years, you
    went from no words to talking with people who had been speaking for decades.</p><p>How?</p><p>Because
    you practised a little per day.</p><p>Then the compound interest kicked in.</p><p>1%
    better every day = 3700% better at the end of the year.</p><p>If you miss a day,
    no matter, life happens. Resume when you can.</p><p>Soon enough you’ll start to
    speak the language of data.</p><h2>F) Don’t beat yourself up for not knowing something</h2><p>“Have
    you ever built a recommendation engine?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“We’ve got a project
    that requires one as a proof of concept, think you can figure it out?”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>Most
    people think learning stops after high-school or college. It doesn’t.</p><p>The
    scenario above happened the other week. I’d never built a recommendation engine.
    Then I did.</p><p>Failure isn’t bad if you’re failing at something you’ve done
    before. You’ve been walking your whole life but you don’t beat yourself up when
    you trip on your own feet. It happens. You keep walking.</p><p>But failing at
    something new is tough. You’ve never done it before.</p><p>Learning machine learning
    kind of goes like this.</p><p>1st year: You suck.</p><p>2nd year: You’re better
    than the year before but you think you suck even more because you realise how
    much you don’t know.</p><p>3rd year: ???? (I’m not there yet)</p><p>Embrace the
    suck.</p><p>How much will beating yourself up for not knowing something help you
    for learning more?</p><p>Zero.</p><p>Learning something new takes time. Every
    day is day one.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4118/1*h_FQfIsmkjLoZTyySxfpLA.png"
    alt="Learning isn’t linear."><em>Learning isn’t linear.</em></p><p>How would your
    3-year-old self react to not knowing a word?</p><p>You’d laugh. Throw your hands
    in the air and then crawl around for a bit.</p><p>It’s the same now. Except you
    can walk.</p><p>¹ All the work I’ve done and things I’ve learned couldn’t have
    been possible without all the great people who’ve created courses and shared what
    they’ve learned.</p><p>Have more questions? Reach out on <a href="http://twitter.com/mrdbourke">Twitter</a>,

  :content: '<p>Photo by Vladimir Kudinov on Unsplash</p><p>My name’s Roger, and I’m
    a self-taught developer. I was planning to go to law school when I was in university,
    but ended up founding a startup instead. The startup failed, but I had to learn
    front-end code (basic HTML/CSS) to help us ship some products.</p><p>I started
    working on a few digital marketing roles that required web development, data analysis
    and other skills, working through and building analytics systems in Python, and
    tinkering with websites in Ruby, HTML and CSS. I’ve placed several other autodidacts
    into their dream jobs in my most recent role as the head of growth for a data
    science and machine learning education company.</p><p>I also just finished writing
    a <a href="http://code-love.com/get-programming-job-without-degree/">80-page guide
    to how to get a programming job without a degree</a>.</p><p>Through it all, I’ve
    shortlisted several useful resources that I myself review frequently, and share
    with different students. My experiences have really helped me learn what useful
    resources help people down their career path and which don’t.</p><p>I’ve been
    a marketer. I can tell which resources barely add value and which do. I’m going
    to point you to the ones that really do add tremendous value. Consider it an insider
    tip.</p><p>So, without further ado, here are the resources I’ve found that genuinely
    work for me and different students.</p><h2>Start with finding your community</h2><p>The
    one thing that’s added the most value for me personally are strong communities
    focused on learning. In workplace settings, <a href="https://blog.gloo.us/employee-mentorship-stats">80%
    of learning</a> takes place between mentors and mentees. You want to surround
    yourself with a supportive community whenever you’re learning something new so
    you can benefit from the same effect.</p><p>Here are some of the communities that
    I found useful:</p><ul><li><p>A subreddit within the larger Reddit community,
    the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/">**learnprogramming subreddit</a>**
    is dedicated to programming resources and for programming learners. It’s a great
    resource where people will upvote the top resources to learn programming for your
    consumption. I found it because I’m a frequent reddit user and to my delight,
    it’s ended up being one of my top resources to consult on a frequent basis.</p></li><li><p>I
    then went on to the ubiquitous <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">**Stack Overflow</a>**.
    Here, you can see a variety of programming challenges and supplied answers from
    experts in different programming communities. I came here both to see the answers
    compiled from experts in the field, and to pose questions myself.</p></li><li><p>I
    then started browsing <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">**Hacker News</a>**.
    It’s a daily curated feed of the most valuable and relevant technology and programming
    news out there. Community members are responsible for upvoting and downvoting
    both articles and comments, ensuring that quality submissions come to the forefront.
    I’ve found the articles to be very high-quality and well-vetted here.</p></li><li><p>I’ve
    reached out to different employees of companies, including Google, Facebook and
    more through here, contacting them through their Hacker News accounts and emails
    they’ve provided me. It’s been an invaluable resource for making career connections
    and for getting great resources to learn from.</p></li><li><p>Then, moving on,
    I found the <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-online-communities-for-programmers-developers-and-software-engineers">**Quora
    programming community</a>**. With many of the initial users based in Silicon Valley,
    the site has become a hotspot for reaching out to intelligent and technically
    skilled folks. I’ve consulted mega-threads related to learning programming and
    asked questions to further my learning here.</p></li><li><p>Finally, I found <a
    href="https://slashdot.org/">**Slashdot</a>,** a large programming community filled
    with IT professionals. It tends to be filled with people who use <a href="https://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>.
    While the community seems to focus more on older closed-source solutions, it can
    still be a useful repository of knowledge, and I browse it occasionally.</p></li></ul><p>The
    really cool thing with these programming communities is that they are all rich
    repositories of genuinely helpful career resources. I managed to reach out to
    different helpful mentors and also consult tons of threads and experiences from
    people who work in the tech industry.</p><h2>Then look through actual code and
    build your portfolio</h2><p>Now that you’re done looking at different communities
    that can help you on your programming journey, you can turn around and do what
    I did. Look for repositories of code where you can start contributing!</p><ul><li><p><a
    href="https://github.com/">**GitHub</a>** is the world’s largest living repository
    of code. The code here is updated by different contributors on an almost-hourly
    basis, with many of the fundamental building blocks of different programming languages
    constantly being hosted and upgraded here. Look through different blocks of code,
    contribute some code of your own, or host projects on Github for collaboration.
    You can also search for the “awesome” repositories to get a list of curated resources
    on different programming topics. That’s how I started seeing the power of mega-lists
    of programming resources.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/">**Bitbucket</a>**
    is another set of Git repositories, more suited to the needs of distributed teams.
    You can use it to upload your code and you can take a look at other repositories.
    The main difference between it and GitHub is that you can have unlimited private
    repositories, unlike GitHub’s pricing when it comes to making repositories private.
    While this makes Bitbucket much more attractive to private teams, it also means
    that most of the open-source projects out there are hosted on GitHub. This is
    more attractive based on the large community of programmers actively looking over
    open-source projects.</p></li></ul><h2>Consult and participate in Wikis</h2><p>When
    I was finished incorporating code repositories and programming communities into
    my daily routine, I turned around to Wikis — constantly updated troves of knowledge
    with tons of user-updated information. I looked to add knowledge, get in touch
    with other knowledge contributors, and absorb as much as possible.</p><p>The following
    Wiki’s were paricularly useful:</p><ul><li><p>The learnprogramming subreddit community
    has already been mentioned above as a great resource. The subreddit has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index">**Learnprogramming
    Wiki</a>**, a collaborative effort between members of that community to create
    a living, valuable resource that can help you with the very basics of code, from
    formatting questions to how to debug.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/">**Wikibooks</a>**
    is a living library of different user-contributed books. Many of them are on programming
    topics such as this <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C++_Programming">Wikibook
    on C++ programming</a>, a resource I consulted when I was looking into the language.</p></li><li><p>Finally,
    the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/Home">**Kaggle Wiki</a>** is a data science
    focused Wiki filled with different resources in the space. It’s the creation of
    Kaggle, an online community of data science admirers who come together to compete
    on the best machine learning models. You can be certain that the Wiki will contain
    a lot of resources that will be valuable to your learning journey on programming
    and data science. This was a resource I recommended often to people looking to
    learn data science.</p></li></ul><h2>Finally, find different approaches to finding
    jobs</h2><p>I know what it can feel like to be on the job hunt. You need all of
    the resources you can get. I was in that place once so I started compiling a list
    of the most effective job boards and places to find a technical job as I looked
    into the process.</p><p>Here is a list of different job boards you should go to
    if you’re looking for a programming job and don’t have a degree that can be particularly
    fruitful for your job search. They’ve been approaches that I’ve battle-tested.
    Consider it a final conclusion of useful, supplemental resources to finding you
    the career you deserve.</p><h3><strong>LinkedIn</strong></h3><p>Sometimes it’s
    good to start at the most obvious place. LinkedIn has a large number of technology
    jobs that you can find quite easily. You can sign up for a free trial of the premium
    version and quickly look through different jobs.</p><p>LinkedIn can also be a
    great way to research hiring managers and get a sense of what a company is like
    before you even apply there. You’ll be able to see what the organizational hierarchy
    looks like by scrolling from one profile to another — and you’ll be able to see
    what skills the company emphasizes, either by looking at the profiles of those
    who were hired or by using your trial Premium account and looking at job postings
    or company pages.</p><p>You’ll want to think about how to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140708162049-7239647-16-tips-to-optimize-your-linkedin-profile-and-enhance-your-personal-brand">optimize
    your LinkedIn profile</a> so you can get the most out of this career-oriented
    social network. I worked hard on my LinkedIn profile, and now, I get tons of recruiters
    reaching out to me out of the blue.</p><h3><strong>Hacker News</strong></h3><p>Besides
    being a great repository of technical articles and a community that curates people
    who are interested in the cutting edge of technology, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">**Hacker
    News</a>** also serves as a job portal of sorts for <a href="http://yclist.com/">Y
    Combinator companies</a>. These are technology companies that might be as young
    as a two-person startup and also those who have started fully maturing (as an
    example, Dropbox, Airbnb, and Quora were all at one time or another incubated
    by Y Combinator).</p><p>The <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/jobs">jobs section</a>
    of the site features different YC companies and their hiring needs. There are
    also <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=whoishiring">monthly threads
    started by a bot</a> called <strong>Ask HN: Who is hiring?</strong> where discussions
    about urgent job opportunities are surfaced that may be hard to find elsewhere.
    Here’s an example of the latest <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14238007">“who’s
    hiring” thread in May 2017</a>.</p><p>By commenting on different articles and
    reaching out to different members in the Hacker News community as mentioned before,
    you’ll reach out to many users who are senior figures in the startup world. You
    might find your way to different mentors and somebody who can introduce you to
    the right hiring manager.</p><h3><a href="https://angel.co/">**AngelList</a>**</h3><p>An
    online repository for different startups. The jobs on offer here tend to be with
    earlier stage companies working at the edge of technology. One great perk about
    this is that entrepreneurs may be more willing to accept people from non-traditional
    backgrounds to work with them — especially if you’re willing to accept and maybe
    even embrace the risk that comes with working in a startup.</p><p>I managed to
    get a job by applying to jobs on AngelList, which was as simple as a one-click
    apply. It was also a great way for me to see what startups were hiring — I highly
    recommend it!</p><p>I hope this list of resources I used is helpful for you! If
    you want more material like this, please check out <a href="http://code-love.com/get-programming-job-without-degree/">my

  :title: Trickle-down workaholism in startups
  :content: '<p>Trickle-down workaholism in startups</p><p>If you want to understand
    why so many startups become infected with unhealthy work habits, or outright workaholism,
    a good place to start your examination is in the attitudes of their venture capital
    investors.</p><p>Consider this Twitter thread involving two famous VCs, Keith
    Rabois and Mark Suster:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3004/1*SeM1rcc1T9Abmrl5VbhHyA.png"
    alt=""></p><p>These sentiments are hardly aberrations. There’s an ingrained mythology
    around startups that not only celebrates burn-out efforts, but damn well requires
    it. It’s the logical outcome of trying to compress a lifetime’s worth of work
    into the abbreviated timeline of a venture fund.</p><p>It’s not hard to understand
    why such a mythology serves the interest of money men who spread their bets wide
    and only succeed when unicorns emerge. Of course they’re going to desire fairytale
    sacrifices. There’s little to no consequence to them if the many fall by the wayside,
    spent to completion trying to hit that home run. Make me rich or die tryin’.</p><p>The
    entrepreneurs who sign up for such pressures may have asked for it. If you, knowing
    their sentiments, ask Rabois or Suster for millions to fund your venture, then
    you probably should expect to have your vacations, weekends, hobbies, family time,
    or outings with the kids questioned.</p><p>But the pressures don’t stop with the
    person who signs the term sheet. That shit trickles down. In fact, it’s likely
    to amplify as it rolls down the hill, like a snowball gathering mass. Because
    once the millions have cleared, and the headcount has been boosted, it’s usually
    other people who actually have to make good on those exponential expectations.</p><p>The
    sly entrepreneur seeks to cajole their employees with carrots. Organic, locally-sourced
    ones, delightfully prepared by a master chef, of course. In the office. Along
    with all the other pampering and indulgent spoils AT THE OFFICE. The game is to
    make it appear as though employees choose this life for themselves, that they
    just love spending all their waking (and in some cases, even sleeping) hours at
    that damn office.</p><p>And if the <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/brave-new-world/soma-symbol.html">soma</a>-like
    inducements don’t work, there’s always the lofty talk about THE MISSION: We’re
    not just here to capture more attention or steal more privacy in the name of advertising,
    no, we’re connecting the world! Your single-track life has meaning! All your sacrifices
    are for a greater good!</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>Not only are these sacrifices
    statistically overwhelmingly likely to be in vain, they’re also completely disproportionate.
    The programmer or designer or writer or even manager that gives up their life
    for a 80+ hour moonshot will comparably-speaking be compensated in bananas, even
    if their lottery coupon should line up. The lion’s share will go to the Scar and
    his hyenas, not the monkeys.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4232/1*ZT-OcDY9-2Hkqde1T15n5Q.png"
    alt="Just listen to teacher / I know it sounds sordid but you’ll be rewarded /
    When at last I am given my dues!"><em>Just listen to teacher / I know it sounds
    sordid but you’ll be rewarded / When at last I am given my dues!</em></p><p>And
    yet so many continue to go along, because they already went this far. Sunk cost
    is an easy theoretical concept, but it’s devilishly hard to put in practice. Which
    is why the yoke of the four-year vesting cliff, the short-exercise window for
    options, and all the other tricks and techniques employed by cap table-designing
    masters are so effective. Once the hook is in, the line and the sinker follows
    easily.</p><p>But it will be in spite of prevailing evidence on the power of sleep,
    recuperation, and sustainable work habits. Whether you’re a top-flight basketball
    player, like Kobe Bryant, whose <a href="https://www.popworkouts.com/kobe-bryant-workout-routine/">off-season
    work schedule</a> is limited to just six hours per day:</p><blockquote><p>The
    Kobe Bryant workout routine features a hefty mix of track work, basketball skills
    and weightlifting. His off-season workout has been called the 666 program because
    he spends 2 hours running, 2 hours on basketball, and 2 hours weightlifting (for
    a total of 6 hours a day, six times a week, for six months).</p></blockquote><p>Or
    his competitor, LeBron James, who frequently gets 12 hours of sleep. Or any of
    the other star athletes who <a href="https://sleep.org/articles/athletes-and-sleep/">prioritize
    their sleep and recuperation</a> as a key component of their performance:</p><blockquote><p>Since
    athletes need more sleep than average people, eight to 10 hours of zzz’s a night
    is recommended, and that’s not just before game day — that’s every evening. After
    all, the more often and more vigorously you use your muscles, the more time it
    takes for your body to repair and rebuild them. Roger Federer and LeBron James
    famously snooze for an average of 12 hours a night, while Usain Bolt, Venus Williams,
    Maria Sharapova, and Steve Nash get up to 10 hours a night. Federer has said,
    “If I don’t sleep 11 to 12 hours per day, it’s not right.</p></blockquote><p>Or
    how about prodigious thinkers and writers, like Trollope, Dickens, or Darwin who
    <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/46/balance/darwin-was-a-slacker-and-you-should-be-too">all
    sought to complete their work within fixed, modest slices of the day, and then
    kept the rest for leisure</a>. Here’s Darwin’s routine:</p><blockquote><p>After
    his morning walk and breakfast, Darwin was in his study by 8 and worked a steady
    hour and a half. At 9:30 he would read the morning mail and write letters. At
    10:30, Darwin returned to more serious work, sometimes moving to his aviary, greenhouse,
    or one of several other buildings where he conducted his experiments. By noon,
    he would declare, “I’ve done a good day’s work,” and set out on a long walk on
    the Sandwalk, a path he had laid out not long after buying Down House. (Part of
    the Sandwalk ran through land leased to Darwin by the Lubbock family.)When he
    returned after an hour or more, Darwin had lunch and answered more letters. At
    3 he would retire for a nap; an hour later he would arise, take another walk around
    the Sandwalk, then return to his study until 5:30, when he would join his wife,
    Emma, and their family for dinner. On this schedule he wrote 19 books, including
    technical volumes on climbing plants, barnacles, and other subjects; the controversial
    Descent of Man; and The Origin of Species, probably the single most famous book
    in the history of science, and a book that still affects the way we think about
    nature and ourselves.</p></blockquote><p>Neither these athletes or these writers
    were giving up anything on whatever contemporaries that may have put in more time,
    more hours, or greater sacrifices. Their contributions to the world were in no
    way diminished by their balanced approach, quite the contrary.</p><p>So don’t
    tell me that there’s something uniquely demanding about building yet another fucking
    startup that dwarfs the accomplishments of The Origin of Species or winning five
    championship rings. It’s bullshit. Extractive, counterproductive bullshit peddled
    by people who either need a narrative to explain their personal sacrifices and
    regrets or who are in a position to treat the lives and wellbeing of others like
    cannon fodder.</p><p>Finally, as way of having my own skin in the game, we’ve
    been running a wonderfully successful business at <a href="https://basecamp.com/?source=svn">Basecamp</a>
    for some fourteen years now. One profitable since the get-go without demanding
    the total consumption of life force from the people working here. Neither from
    Jason nor I, nor from our employees.</p><p>Hell, right now, we’re working <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/benefits-and-perks.md#summer-hours">our
    four-day summer weeks</a> until the end of August. This while servicing over a

    a new book</a>, and ranting with a fervor against the extractive logic of many
    a venture capitalist. Forty hours or less has been plenty to do all of that since
    the beginning, and it’s likely to be plenty for you too.</p><p>Workaholism is
    a disease. We need treatment and coping advice for those afflicted, not cheerleaders
    for their misery.</p><p><em>If the ways of venture capital has you thinking there’s

  :title: Growing Startups When the Product Sucks
  :content: '<p>We have exactly $325,710 left in our bank account.</p><p>The cash
    is burning fast, and we’ve already wasted a big portion of our seed investment
    trying to market a product for which we thought we had already found a product/market
    fit.</p><p><em>“Four out of ten,”</em> shouts Lauren, breaking the silence we’ve
    had for almost twenty minutes in our meeting room.</p><p>Things were finally looking
    promising, with the new version of our product we’ve been testing over the last
    weeks.</p><blockquote><p>“Four out of ten people repurchased our new product!
    And some even brought their friends. Now, imagine we achieved such a high repeat
    rate and word of mouth in all the locations where we’ll be launching.”</p></blockquote><p>Sitting
    today in this meeting room in Singapore and seeing Lauren’s excitement over those
    four out of ten people, I remember, once again, how reading <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/the-only-way-to-grow-huge">those
    powerful lines</a> from Sam Altman had hit me back in 2013:</p><blockquote><h1>“…
    if you want to be a great company someday, you have to eventually build something
    so good that people will recommend it to their friends-in fact, so good that they
    want to be the first one to recommend it to their friends for the implied good
    taste. No growth hack, brilliant marketing idea, or sales team can save you long
    term if you don’t have a sufficiently good product.”</h1></blockquote><p>I’ve
    helped quite a few startups with growth, but this was probably one of the rare
    ones where the founder’s entire focus was on organic growth, driven by customer
    satisfaction and word of mouth.</p><p>It was really rare, though. Usually, the
    first months at a startup begin with a ‘exploration phase’ where you often hear
    <em>‘oh yes, we just got the first $500K investment, let’s hire as many good people
    as we can and spend the money on exploring growth channels like Facebook ads.’</em></p><p>Then,
    this attitude quickly disappears as the runway gets shorter.</p><p>Soon, things
    get serious and it’s time your HR brings on board an analyst to understand where
    those dollars went and which of those random traction channels brought growth.</p><p>And
    if what starts as a simple analysis turns into a decision to restructure your
    entire startup, the marketing team is likely to be the first to get kicked out
    the door, so those not-yet-fired can make the product work with the rest of the
    cash left in the bank account.</p><p>But why hire and fire fast or focus on growth
    too soon, before understanding whether your product was working in the first place?</p><p>It
    turns out this often-overlooked dilemma is more complicated than it seems.</p><h2>Product
    vs. Growth</h2><p>It’s obvious: The first step to building a great company starts
    with making something worth talking about.</p><p>But what is not so obvious is
    at what stage of building your startup do you understand whether what you’ve made
    is something worth talking about?</p><p>When you’re still small, it’s easy to
    fool yourself (and investors) and bring month-over-month growth by spending money
    on inorganic growth channels such as ads, marketing, or getting featured on TechCrunch.</p><p>But
    as you grow bigger, it gets increasingly difficult to sustain such growth rate
    by buying your way through if the word about your product isn’t spreading organically.</p><p>At
    this stage, you might take different routes, among which also lie these two options:</p><ul><li><p>Step
    back to understand what exactly isn’t working with your product and iterate/pivot
    or have the guts to start over if necessary.</p></li><li><p>To sustain the same
    growth rate, set more aggressive targets for marketing and sales teams.</p><blockquote><h1>“…
    if your product isn’t quite working, but you have to hit these really aggressive
    targets, you end up forcing it… even if you hit the numbers, they won’t be real.
    You spent a lot of money to get there. And what is the point in acquiring all
    those users, if they leave once they see the product?”</h1></blockquote></li></ul><p>That’s
    <a href="http://andrewchen.co/">Andrew Chen</a>, part of the growth team at Uber,
    once again, <a href="https://blog.mixpanel.com/2016/03/16/andrew-chen-and-the-state-of-growth-hacking/">repeating
    that</a>, without a great product, there is no growth.</p><p>And he isn’t alone,
    either. <a href="https://blog.optimizely.com/2015/05/26/slack-marketing-growth/">According
    to Bill Macaitis</a>, the legendary CMO of hyper-growth startup Slack, when measured
    solely on aggressive short-term metrics, the sales and marketing teams then have
    an incentive <em>“to do bad things to people — to put them in those prison landing
    pages and start calling them before they’re ready.”</em></p><p>This is especially
    important for seed-stage startups thinking about how best to position themselves
    for their series A, as they get confused about whether to focus on traction or
    on product.</p><p>According to renowned investor, <a href="https://twitter.com/robgo">Rob
    Go</a>, when startups focus exclusively on a <a href="https://medium.com/startup-traction/traction-vs-product-499ab3900834#.56qabtr2z">growth
    solves (nearly) all problems</a> strategy, things get sacrificed in favor of growth.
    <em>“You might do unscalable, hacky things to get customers. You might do tons
    of stuff manually to fulfil the promise of your service instead of taking more
    time and using more resources to build software. You will probably make decisions
    to sacrifice margin for growth,”</em> he adds.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3000/0*Yw7NQ7cylTIloZ8i.png"
    alt=""></p><h2>But wait, this isn’t a zero-sum game</h2><p>This isn’t either growth
    or product.</p><p>You still need growth or some traction, at the very least, to
    find the few early customers who will use your product and help you understand
    what they want.</p><p>And many founders <a href="https://medium.dave-bailey.com/why-founders-fail-to-market-their-products-f7c15935c81#.60hnfekjf">will
    also confess</a> focusing only on product and ignoring marketing failed their
    startup, never mind <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/HubSpot/jumpstart-inboundmarketingv2/18-YOURE_NOT_ALONEThe_marketing_has">those
    experts</a> recommending why you should start marketing the day you build your
    product.</p><p>In his best-selling book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-Customer/dp/1591848369">Traction</a>,
    DuckDuckGo founder <a href="https://twitter.com/yegg">Gabriel Weinberg</a> points
    to ‘The 50 Percent Rule’ and suggests spending 50 percent of your time on product
    and 50 percent on traction.</p><p>Hence, the problem isn’t focusing on growth.</p><p>The
    problem is focusing on growth too much, too soon.</p><h2>Having the guts to start
    over</h2><p>Airbnb took <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/before-you-grow/">almost
    1000 days</a> to find a product people loved. Since then, their organic growth
    via word of mouth has been phenomenal and still continues today.</p><p>Slack,
    referred to today as the startup with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/01/rocketship-emoji/">’insane’
    growth</a>, started with games, kept making games <a href="https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/slack-fastest-growing-b2b-saas-business-ever">for
    four years</a>, failed at <a href="http://firstround.com/review/From-0-to-1B-Slacks-Founder-Shares-Their-Epic-Launch-Strategy/">making
    games</a>, pivoted its entire team toward communications, started building the
    Slack we know today toward the end of 2012, and only by August of 2013 was it
    running in private beta.</p><p>We easily forget building something great takes
    time, and instead, try to <a href="https://medium.com/startup-traction/traction-vs-product-499ab3900834#.xgz7mm1de">staff
    up very quickly</a> the minute money is in the bank, just because the people we
    found available for hire are great, regardless of whether we actually need them
    or have a position to fill.</p><p>Before stepping on the gas aggressively, why
    not measure if what you’ve built is worth talking about?</p><p>Most startups set
    <a href="https://hbr.org/2003/12/the-one-number-you-need-to-grow">Net Promoter
    Score</a> (NPS) as their number-one metric to measure user love. Some startups
    have also <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/net-promoter-score">been sharing
    lessons</a> from sending their survey to measure NPS.</p><p>And next to NPS, a
    few others, <a href="https://blog.optimizely.com/2015/05/26/slack-marketing-growth/">such
    as Slack</a>, also use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_satisfaction">CSAT</a>
    (customer satisfaction) as long-term metrics.</p><p>As Sam Altman concluded last
    month <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/before-you-grow/">in a follow-up post</a>
    he published after three years:</p><blockquote><h1>“Startups are defined by growth,
    but growth isn’t step one in building a great company. If you focus on trying
    to grow before you make a product people love, you are unlikely to succeed…</h1><h1>…so
    if you’re already growing a company around a mediocre product, fix it now. Don’t
    try to avoid the problem by raising capital for growth– the problems will still
    be there, with higher expectations. And if you’re just starting out, take the
    time to build a product your users love, no matter how long it takes. When they
    actively recommend your product to friends, you’re in the right place.”</h1></blockquote><p>Don’t
    hurt your company by focusing on growth too much, too soon.</p><pre><code>*This

  :title: 4 Engineering Mistakes That Kill Startups
  :content: '<p>From chasing shiny tech to scaling too soon, beware these common missteps
    that can endanger your company</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*bgeNz76pgL19vrP5Erv9gQ.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>In 2016, I gave technical advice to a first-time CEO and entrepreneur
    building a seed-funded food delivery marketplace. In my view, every tech choice
    the company had made under his direction was wrong.</p><p>He believed in “empowering
    the engineer” and let the company’s first engineer choose the framework (Scala/Play)
    because it was what that engineer wanted to use — not because it made sense for
    the company, the company’s use case, or its recruiting pool. Much of the early
    technical work had been outsourced. The company’s product road map was also wildly
    optimistic (building web and mobile concurrently) despite the fact that most of
    the business was still unvalidated. It was a recipe for disaster.</p><p>Startup
    engineering is different from any other type of software engineering. It demands
    short- and medium-term productivity, relative to the “right way” of building systems.
    It values engineers who are able to iterate quickly and are comfortable with hacky
    code. It rewards pragmatism in technology choices versus picking the most hyped
    — or most stable — technology.</p><p>If your startup has yet to find product-market
    fit, here are four common engineering traps to avoid.</p><h2>1. Premature scaling</h2><p>Premature
    scaling — the most common engineering mistake startups make — trades immediate
    productivity for far-off, and often never-realized, benefits. It means dedicating
    time and resources toward large-scale builds when the company is still too small
    to know what might be needed in the future.</p><p>Premature scaling troubles are
    everywhere in startups. In the early 2010s, relational databases were shunned
    partly for the (perceived) infinite scalability of <a href="https://www.nemil.com/mongo/1.html">NoSQL
    databases</a> like MongoDB and Cassandra. The startup productivity benefits of
    <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html">monoliths</a> has
    been lost in the excitement around microservices. For years, Rails has been called
    <a href="http://blog.jaredfriedman.com/2015/09/15/why-i-wouldnt-use-rails-for-a-new-company/">unfit
    for startups</a> because it is slower than other frameworks.</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/2655482ab5bf40affc08d47681b8c5f1"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>Scaling before reaching product-market fit is a waste
    of engineering resources, and can be devastating to early startups, which often
    have little money and few engineers to deliver on huge feature requirements that
    require constant iteration.</p><p>So, if premature scaling is so deadly to startups,
    why does it occur so often?</p><p>First of all, scaling is fun. The initial version
    of Twitter was a simple, monolithic CRUD application. Just a few years in, however,
    Twitter had a panoply of interesting problems: large amounts of data to query,
    a huge cost to downtime, large usage spikes, a huge user base. Adding the scaled
    technologies to address these needs made being an engineer there more exciting
    and attractive to those looking to join the team. That excitement makes scaling
    too early an easy trap for engineering teams to fall into.</p><p>Second, building
    performant systems only seems rational. Some engineers are appalled by hacky systems,
    treating them as though they are a moral failing. This aversion to potentially
    inelegant solutions can be especially hindering for startup engineers who are
    used to working at large tech companies where everything must be done at scale.
    But there’s a reason “do things that don’t scale” is a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html">regular
    missive</a> at Y Combinator, and it applies to engineering as much as it does
    to business processes.</p><p>Technical debt kills fewer early-stage startups than
    you might think. If your company is successful, you’ll often have the money to
    fix all the engineering shortcuts you’ve taken and mistakes you’ve made.</p><p>Third,
    engineering road maps and tools are built around hyperoptimistic views of the
    future. Startup leaders are idealistic about their business growth because, let’s
    face it, they wouldn’t have started their companies otherwise. Even once a company
    hits a product-market fit — that critical milestone when engineering decisions
    need to be reassessed — the danger is still that you’ll overestimate the level
    of scale you’ll need before you actually need it.</p><p>Trying to anticipate those
    future needs before they arise takes valuable resources away from your immediate
    goal: building a product that people <a href="https://www.nemil.com/musings/make-something-people-need.html">need</a>.</p><h2>2.
    Using shiny, untested technology</h2><p>“Shiny” technology is tech that software
    engineers clamor for. It often makes an engineer’s work easier and more enjoyable,
    especially in the extreme short term. But jumping at the chance to use — and rely
    on — the newest, shiniest tech risks missing better options that are the most
    productive for the broader team in the medium term.</p><p>For example, MongoDB’s
    JavaScript-like DSL and JSON data store made writing code an <a href="https://www.nemil.com/mongo/2.html">easier
    experience</a> for JavaScript developers used to relational SQL databases. But
    ease of use should not be the primary metric when choosing a database.</p><p><img

    (Slideshare)*"><strong>Source: Karpov, Valeri. <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/mongodb/mongodb2-21677032/7-MEAN_StackWeb_dev_framework_for">The
    MEAN Stack: MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js</a> (Slideshare)</strong></p><p>During
    a job interview, a software engineer once told me that he’d never work at a company
    that didn’t use CoffeeScript. (Today, the debate might be about <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18839008">using
    Elixir</a>.) His refusal to even consider other tools promised problems down the
    line if the right solution was at odds with his preferred programming language.</p><p>New
    technology has issues, too. The failure states are poorly understood, which makes
    it hard to anticipate how things will break. New languages and frameworks don’t
    have libraries, or many engineers who can write in them. This lack of resources
    increases the development effort and makes recruiting new engineers challenging.
    It also means committing your startup’s scarce engineering resources to learning
    something new, instead of creating features that your users value.</p><p>Engineers
    — especially non-founders — want to implement technology that makes them seem
    relevant in the market. While that makes sense for their own interests and skill-building,
    that kind of approach should be worrying as part of a startup plan. In spaces
    like front-end engineering, having engineers chase the current hype cycle could
    mean rewriting the stack every six to 12 months.</p><p>Early-career developers
    can be especially susceptible to choosing new and shiny technology instead of
    tried and tested tools that make the most sense for the project at hand. Until
    you’ve been through a few hype cycles or seen the downsides of choosing the latest
    technology firsthand, it can be easy to be blinded by glossy marketing pushes
    in Hacker News or at “hackathons” and conferences.</p><blockquote><h1>As an engineer
    you’re taking a huge risk joining a startup. Adding hyped-but-unnecessary technology
    to the mix only heightens that risk.</h1></blockquote><p>Just because a technology
    is hyped doesn’t mean it’s appropriate in a startup environment. When teams are
    small, new developers don’t always have the mentorship from seasoned engineers
    to counteract the external media they see.</p><p>Engineers are already taking
    a huge risk in joining a startup. Adding hyped-but-unnecessary technology to the
    mix only heightens that risk.</p><h2>3. Hiring the wrong engineers</h2><p>It’s
    become a bit of a running joke about job descriptions these days, but startups
    often make the mistake of looking for “rock stars” or “ninjas.” They want employees
    with fancy educational credentials and the pixie dust that comes from having a
    team made up of people who’ve been part of other successful companies.</p><p>In
    Silicon Valley, startup job posts favor candidates who use new and shiny technology
    over more pragmatic engineers who can learn the necessary tools quickly. Once
    a company starts looking for these perceived ninjas and rock stars, it sets the
    tone for every subsequent hire.</p><p>The vast number of software engineers don’t
    work for startups, and startup engineering is rarely taught. As such, most engineers
    who join startups don’t come in with the skill set or attitude to succeed in a
    startup environment. Consequently, startups often rely on engineers who aren’t
    a perfect fit for their projects.</p><p>Each of these engineers brings a different
    sort of risk to a startup:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Large company engineers</strong>
    are often used to scaled systems and may not feel comfortable with hacky startup
    code. They’re also much less likely to have been exposed to their users.</p></li><li><p><strong>Elite
    computer scientists</strong> often get bored by the plumbing-type engineering
    typical of early startup tasks, which can lead to overengineering.</p></li><li><p><strong>Junior
    engineers</strong>, who are often attracted to startups, may inject too much shiny,
    new technology or poorly architect their systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Development
    shops</strong> often favor technologies that let them be productive across many
    clients. These shops have no incentive to learn new tools for a particular client,
    and also don’t have the long-term skin in the game needed to make critical early
    tech decisions.</p></li></ul><p>Startups need to look beyond degrees and fancy
    resumes to find the best engineering candidates for their projects. Ideal engineers
    for early-stage startups are those who are excited about the company’s mission.
    This ensures they’ll stay, even when the company inevitably hits challenges along
    the journey to product-market fit. These engineers have a minimum viable product
    (MVP) mindset and are comfortable with constant iteration. The best startup engineers
    often have a few years of experience in the workforce or on open-source projects
    — they’ve learned how to maintain systems, not just build them.</p><p>Rather than
    seeing particular technologies as silver bullets, great startup engineers favor
    productive tools that meet the medium-term needs of the organization, and see
    technology as a means to solving a problem. They think about the problem space
    (the user’s needs) and how software can be used to solve the problem, rather than
    looking for a problem that a shiny, new technology can solve.</p><p>They need
    to have can-do attitudes and rise to the Herculean challenges in front of them
    while moderating, but not naysaying, the optimism of the product owners. At the
    same time, these engineers need to have empathy and intuition for their users
    because they often play the role of product when iterating.</p><p>One cautionary
    note: Even among startup engineers, the experience gained at each stage of a startup
    is radically different. A startup engineer who is effective in a team of five
    engineers may be terrible in a team of 25. For startups hiring talent, don’t let
    previous experience as part of a successful startup overwhelm the nuance of what
    that person actually did there.</p><h2>4. Problems with product and management</h2><p>Startup
    founders are wildly optimistic. They have to be. But this means that the product
    road map usually exceeds the capabilities of their small teams, leading to too
    much hiring, too much fundraising, and, eventually, burnout. For management, this
    cycle begins to look like the engineers aren’t performing, when it actually means
    that management hasn’t set a clear and narrow vision.</p><p>The “always be pitching”
    mentality of startup founders can give engineering teams a mistaken sense of certainty
    about how their systems should be built, despite the uncertainty that exists in
    the business model. A better approach for startup founders to adopt is to support
    optimistic engineers while developing (internally) pessimistic business leaders,
    with both sides working together to find product-market fit.</p><p>Management
    teams also often turn to engineering advisers — engineers at other successful
    startups — to help guide their new company. Importing these “experts” can cause
    problems when these advisers try to transplant what has worked at their particular
    company to a new startup that they have spent only a few hours trying to understand.</p><p>Finally,
    management needs to recognize that engineers are a critical component of any major
    product decision. Too often, engineering teams are seen as service organizations
    that can be steamrolled when important business decisions arise. Ensuring a healthy
    relationship between product and engineering teams is just one more reason it’s
    critical to have hired the right engineers (see number three).</p><p>Even if you
    avoid these four startup engineering pitfalls, you’ll still be faced with challenges
    aplenty. But, by steering clear of these traps, at least you’ll worry less about
    self-inflicted wounds.</p><p><em>Thanks to Eddie Kim, Andrew Miklas, Shvet Jain,

    of the leaked memo Yahoo! sent to its employees:</p><blockquote><p>To become the
    absolute best place to work, communication and collaboration will be important,
    so we need to be working side-by-side. That is why it is critical that we are
    all present in our offices. Some of the best decisions and insights come from
    hallway and cafeteria discussions, meeting new people, and impromptu team meetings.
    Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home. We need to be one
    Yahoo!, and that starts with physically being together.</p></blockquote><p>Because
    let’s not forget — being physically present means you are doing your best work!
    Speed and quality can only happen in person! Never mind that many other companies
    have been successful with remote teams.</p><p>So maybe that helps explain why
    Mayer believes she can walk into an office on a Saturday, survey who’s there in
    person, and can declare the winners.</p><p>Because to her, if you’re not there

    alt=""></p><p>In the same article, Mayer talks about her experience at Google:</p><blockquote><p>The
    other piece that gets overlooked in the Google story is the value of hard work….The
    actual experience was more like, “Could you work 130 hours in a week?” The answer
    is yes, if you’re strategic about when you sleep, when you shower, and how often
    you go to the bathroom…For my first five years, I did at least one all-nighter
    a week, except when I was on vacation — and the vacations were few and far between.</p></blockquote><p>While
    that might sound crazy to most of us, I don’t really have a problem with it.</p><p>She
    was making a decision <em>for herself</em>. She decided to work long hours, pull
    all nighters, and eschew vacations. That’s her call. ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p><p>But it’s not
    OK to imply that kind of work/life <em>imbalance</em> is a key to success for
    others.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*BSBoIk4KydlpJT3zRn3Hrw.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>Hey, if someone wants to work *themselves *into the ground, that’s
    up to them.</p><p><strong>But spreading the message that hard work and success
    can only be achieved through long hours and weekend work — that’s not OK</strong>.
    It’s patently false, and it’s already <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/eat-sleep-code-repeat-is-such-bullshit-c2a4d9beaaf5">far

  :title: 'Data Science for Startups: Introduction'
  :content: '<p>Data Science for Startups: Introduction</p><p>I recently changed industries
    and joined a startup company where I’m responsible for building up a data science
    discipline. While we already had a solid data pipeline in place when I joined,
    we didn’t have processes in place for reproducible analysis, scaling up models,
    and performing experiments. The goal of this series of blog posts is to provide
    an overview of how to build a data science platform from scratch for a startup,
    providing real examples using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that readers can try
    out themselves.</p><p>This series is intended for data scientists and analysts
    that want to move beyond the model training stage, and build data pipelines and
    data products that can be impactful for an organization. However, it could also
    be useful for other disciplines that want a better understanding of how to work
    with data scientists to run experiments and build data products. It is intended
    for readers with programming experience, and will include code examples primarily
    in R and Java.</p><h3>Why Data Science?</h3><p>One of the first questions to ask
    when hiring a data scientist for your startup is* how will data science improve
    our product*? At <a href="https://angel.co/windfall-data">Windfall Data</a>, our
    product is data, and therefore the goal of data science aligns well with the goal
    of the company, to build the most accurate model for estimating net worth. At
    other organizations, such as a mobile gaming company, the answer may not be so
    direct, and data science may be more useful for understanding how to run the business
    rather than improve products. However, in these early stages it’s usually beneficial
    to start collecting data about customer behavior, so that you can improve products
    in the future.</p><p>Some of the benefits of using data science at a start up
    are:</p><ol><li><p>Identifying key business metrics to track and forecast</p></li><li><p>Building
    predictive models of customer behavior</p></li><li><p>Running experiments to test
    product changes</p></li><li><p>Building data products that enable new product
    features</p></li></ol><p>Many organizations get stuck on the first two or three
    steps, and do not utilize the full potential of data science. The goal of this
    series of blog posts is to show how managed services can be used for small teams
    to move beyond data pipelines for just calculating run-the-business metrics, and
    transition to an organization where data science provides key input for product
    development.</p><h3>Series Overview</h3><p>Here are the topics I am planning to
    cover for this blog series. As I write new sections, I may add or move around
    sections. Please provide comments at the end of this posts if there are other
    topics that you feel should be covered.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Introduction (this

  :title: Why Startups Fall Apart at 50 Employees
  :content: '<p>Coaching your business from its teen phase to adulthood</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/13440/1*bvfNJpysOtpWCnr3hZbtSA.jpeg"
    alt="Photo: Luis Alvarez/Getty Images"><em>Photo: Luis Alvarez/Getty Images</em></p><p>Ask
    anyone who’s worked at more than one startup and they’ll probably tell you the
    same thing: Young companies start to go off the rails once they hit 50 employees.
    I call this the “teenager” startup phase, and I’ve been there several times, both
    as an employee and an executive.</p><p>What does this look like?</p><p><strong>Employee
    one through 10:</strong> At a certain point, the original employees stop learning
    new people’s names. They won’t come right out and say it but they start to resent
    having to show yet another noob how to do the same simple things. Their tolerance
    for mistakes, even for the same mistakes they once made themselves, goes into
    the toilet.</p><p><strong>Employee 10 through 25:</strong> The second tier of
    employees then starts to form small, protective cliques. They may occasionally
    drop references to the “good old days.” They place a growing importance on things
    like titles and status. Discussions might start to percolate about adopting the
    title prefix “Senior.”</p><p><strong>Employee 26 through 39:</strong> This is
    the group where power plays start to happen. If the “teens” are going to form
    tribes, the late-twenties and thirties are going to start raising hell against
    the old guard.</p><p><strong>Employees 40 through 49:</strong> WTF is going on?</p><p>While
    this scenario may not be true for every employee in every group, it always happens
    to at least a few people after a startup hits 50 employees. Like I said, I’ve
    been in each group and I’ve exhibited each of these behaviors, so I’m not judging
    here.</p><p>Well, maybe I’m judging a little. But we need to talk about what to
    do when your company feels like it’s going off the rails. We need to get our teenage
    startups out of the house and into the world like functioning adults.</p><p>Hitting
    chaos at 50 employees could mean several positive things. For one, it definitely
    means a company is growing, likely faster than planned. And as long as the growth
    doesn’t get too far out of hand, that’s a good problem to have.</p><p>If growth
    is indeed happening and it’s organic, your company has probably already developed
    an internal culture, lexicon, and set of operations that may not be documented
    but are definitely understood. Communication probably happens more on a face-to-face
    and on-demand basis than in memos and meetings, which means there’s likely not
    a lot of time wasted getting everyone on the same page.</p><p>Chaos is also a
    sign that your company’s executives are spending time building the product, penetrating
    the market, and satisfying customers. They’re probably not hung up on the structure
    of the company itself. But the chaos is also definitely a sign that it’s time
    to start paying attention to this gawky teenager of a company before it rebels
    and runs away.</p><blockquote><h1>Even if everything goes right, things will go
    wrong.</h1></blockquote><p>As any parent knows, there’s no cure for the teenage
    years; we just have to wait it out. There’s an old buzz theme about chaos that
    I hate: “Storming, forming, norming, performing.” It applies here, but I hate
    it because I don’t think it actually helps us.</p><p>We can’t cure chaos. But
    we can put measures in place to survive the storm. Here are the measures I’m most
    familiar with or intrigued by:</p><h2>Do nothing</h2><p>This is a valid option.
    A lot of companies do this until they start losing people. And by “do nothing,”
    I don’t mean doing absolutely nothing. That’s impossible because issues will come
    up and we can’t hide from them. Instead, “doing nothing” means proactively doing
    nothing and then solving each issue as it arises.</p><p>I don’t recommend this
    solution.</p><p>Think about what happens when we start to hand out titles like
    “senior” without rules for how those titles get handed out. Let’s talk about meetings.
    We’ll need rules as to when and how they get created. Otherwise, everyone’s calendar
    will eventually fill up, conference rooms will become scarce, and nothing will
    ever get done. Even things like working remotely need to be considered. If we
    don’t have standards in place, and even if everything goes right, things will
    go wrong. I’m not just talking about abuse here; I’m also talking about how the
    rest of the team can be effective when one or more of their co-workers isn’t in
    the same place.</p><p>Startups are usually scared of becoming stale, corporate,
    or heavy-handed. And I get it: I hate those things too. But at some point, structure
    becomes mandatory and it’s better to be proactive about it.</p><p>*<em>What I’d
    rather do: *</em>Centralize and be transparent. At the very least, create a single
    truth for rules, processes, guidelines, and FAQs. Make sure everyone has access
    to those documents. Then be transparent about why you’re doing things the way
    you do them. This isn’t just about rules; it’s also about the company’s overall
    philosophy.</p><h2>Hire tons of middle managers</h2><p>This is the polar opposite
    of the “do nothing” strategy, and I’d compare it to using a sledgehammer to crack
    a nut. This strategy usually happens way too early in a company’s growth cycle.
    Plus, hiring more people to manage other people means wasting a lot of productivity
    for a little bit of order.</p><p>If we’re hiring managers from outside the company
    because they have experience leading teams at larger companies, they’ll have to
    integrate themselves and learn how we operate before they can be effective. Often
    these people will try to bring their older, larger company’s schema with them,
    which doesn’t fit.</p><p>But if we promote from within, we’re likely burdening
    our best people with something we didn’t hire them for. For example, often a CTO
    will take the best developer and say: “Here, manage the rest of your team for
    50 percent of your time.” Then the developer’s productivity bottoms out on the
    coding side, and the rest of their team becomes resentful on the management side.</p><p>*<em>What
    I’d rather do: *</em>Create owners and team leads instead of bosses. At 50 employees,
    people usually don’t need management. However, things and processes do. This includes
    the product, the front-end development, the hiring, the invoicing, and whatever
    else you can think of. Give various people ownership of those things or make them
    team leads of those processes.</p><h2>Do what that other company did</h2><p>I’m
    all for stealing smart ways of doing things and adopting them as our own. I steal
    bits of Agile for methodology. I nick stuff from Amazon all the time for strategy.
    I really like what Lyft is doing with UX. But do you remember the trend from about
    three years ago when several Silicon Valley companies tried to solve income disparity
    by making everyone’s salary public? Yeah. That was a valid problem but there’s
    no way you can convince me that making every salary public was the solution. That
    strategy may be working for them (or not), but I don’t have any evidence that
    it will work for my company.</p><p>Trendy solutions come and go. Open workspaces
    were all the rage to promote teamwork, then earbuds happened. Unlimited vacation
    is starting to wane as a recruiting tool. On the other side, parental leave for
    work-life balance looks like it will stick. My point is that just because one,
    some, or even most companies are adopting a policy, that doesn’t mean it will
    work for you.</p><p><strong>What I’d rather do:</strong> Divide and experiment.
    Take pieces of policies from different companies and run small experiments to
    see if they’ll work in your environment.</p><h2>Stop hiring and outsource</h2><p>This
    strategy says: Once we hit a certain number of employees, we can stop hiring and
    outsource everything. This could include some clean breaks, like outsourcing all
    of development, all of human resources, or all of support. It could also mean
    adding external resources to internal teams, like consultants and independent
    contractors, offshore teams, and third-party service providers.</p><p>This strategy
    will let you run a tight ship. You can expand and contract on the rocky growth
    road without cutting headcount. On the other hand, 50 employees is usually just
    a stepping stone to 100 employees or 1,000 or sometimes even more than that. There
    are huge risks in having all that knowledge and experience out-of-house.</p><p>This
    strategy is also trickier to implement than it sounds. We’ll have to make surgical
    cuts as we grow and once we hit the 49th employee, what happens next? What happens
    when we find that next awesome hire? Do we need to let someone else go, or should
    we wait for someone to quit?</p><p><strong>What I’d rather do:</strong> Lease
    with the option to buy. A lot of startups bring on contractors and part-timers
    who eventually become employees—but only when there’s enough money, enough runway,
    and enough need for that resource. I built two of my startups that way. Do this
    on a larger scale as you grow, absorbing teams when it makes sense. Run each team
    like an independent organization within the company.</p><p>If there’s a cure for
    chaos at 50 employees, it might have its roots in that last solution. What if
    a company organizational chart didn’t flow vertically from top to bottom but rather
    looked like a series of pods? Those pods could have their own pods if needed.
    Then company leaders would exist as single-person pod with spokes to the larger
    pods.</p><p>Each pod would be run independently, like its own little company within
    the company. Then the outsourced resources could be their own pods, and they could
    come, go, and be absorbed as necessary.</p><p>I don’t know if this strategy would
    work. It might be wild, and it’s certainly hard to put on a sheet of paper. I’m
    sure it comes with its own set of problems. But my point is if we want a cure
    for the chaos of 50 employees, we need to build a different kind of company that
    runs in a unique way from day one.</p><p>And until that happens, we need to keep
    an eye on our teenage startup until it becomes a functioning adult.</p>'

  :title: Why Some Startups Win
  :content: "<p>I was having a second coffee with an ex student, now the head of a
    marketing inside a rapidly growing startup. His company had marched through customer
    discovery, learned about the customer problem, validated solutions, and was now
    scaling sales and marketing. All good news.</p><p>But he was getting uneasy that
    as his headcount was growing the productivity of his marketing department seemed
    to be rapidly declining.</p><p>I wasn’t surprised. When organizations are small
    (startups, small teams in companies, and government agencies) early employees
    share a mission — why they come to work, what they need to do while they are at
    work, and how they will know they have succeeded. But as these organizations grow,
    what was once a shared mission and intent gets buried under HR process and Key
    Performance Indicators.</p><p>I told him that I had learned long ago that to keep
    that from happening, you need to on-board/train your team about mission and intent.</p><h2><strong>Why
    do you work here?</strong></h2><p>I had taken the job of VP of Marketing in a
    company emerging from bankruptcy. We’d managed to secure another infusion of cash,
    but it wasn’t going to last long.</p><p>During my first week on the job, I asked
    each of my department heads what they did for marketing and for the company. When
    I asked our trade show manager, she looked surprised and said, “Steve, don’t you
    know that my job is to take our booth to trade shows and set it up?” The other
    departments gave the same type of logistical answers — the product-marketing department,
    for example, said their job was to get the product specs from Engineering and
    write data sheets. But my favorite was when the public relations manager told
    me, “We’re here to summarize the data sheets and put them in press releases and
    then answer the phone in case the press calls.”</p><p>If these sound like reasonable
    answers to you, and you are in a startup, update your resume.</p><h2>Titles are
    not your job</h2><p>When I pressed my staff to explain why marketing did trade
    shows or wrote press releases or penned data sheets, the best response I could
    get was, “Why that’s our job.” In their heads their titles were a link back to
    a Human Resources job spec that came from a 10,000-person company (i.e., listing
    duties and responsibilities, skills and competencies, reporting relationships)</p><blockquote><h1>It
    dawned on me that we had a department full of people with titles describing process-centric
    <em>execution</em> while we were in environment that required relentless <em>agility
    and speed with urgency</em>.</h1></blockquote><p>While their titles might be what
    their business cards said, titles were not their job — and being a slave to process
    lost the sight of the forest for the trees. This was the last thing we needed
    in a company where every day could be our last.</p><p>Titles in a startup are
    not the same as what your job is. This is a big idea.</p><h2><strong>Department
    mission statements: What am I supposed to do today?</strong></h2><p>It wasn’t
    that I had somehow inherited dumb employees. What I was hearing was a <strong>failure
    of management.</strong></p><blockquote><h1>No one had on-boarded these people.
    No one had differentiated a startup job description from a large company job.
    They were all doing what they thought they were supposed to.</h1></blockquote><p>But
    most importantly, no one had sat the marketing department down and defined our
    department Mission (with a capital “M”).</p><p>Most startups put together a corporate
    mission statement because the CEO remembered seeing one at his last job or the
    investors said they needed one. Most companies spend an inordinate amount of time
    crafting a finely honed corporate mission statement for external consumption and
    then do nothing internally to make it happen. What I’m about to describe here
    is quite different.</p><p><strong>What our marketing department was missing was
    anything that gave the marketing staff daily guidance about what they should be
    doing.</strong> The first reaction from my CEO was, “That’s why you’re running
    the department.” And yes, we could have built a top-down, command-and-control
    hierarchy, but what I wanted was an agile marketing <em>team capable of operating
    independently</em> without day-to-day direction.</p><p>We needed to craft a Departmental
    Mission Statement that told everyone:</p><ul><li><p>why they came to work</p></li><li><p>what
    they needed to do while they were at work</p></li><li><p>and how they would know
    they had succeeded.</p></li></ul><p>And it was going to mention the two words
    that marketing needed to live and breathe: <strong>revenue</strong> and <strong>profit</strong>.</p><h2><strong>Five
    easy pieces: The marketing mission</strong></h2><p>After a few months of talking
    to customers and working with sales, we defined the marketing Mission (our job)
    as:</p><blockquote><p><em>Help Sales deliver $25 million in sales with a 45% gross
    margin. To do that we will create end-user demand and drive it into the sales
    channel, educate the channel and customers about why our products are superior,
    and help Engineering understand customer needs and desires. We will accomplish
    this through demand-creation activities (advertising, PR, tradeshows, seminars,
    web sites, etc.), competitive analyses, channel and customer collateral (white
    papers, data sheets, product reviews), customer surveys, and customer discovery
    findings.</em><em>This year, marketing needs to provide sales with 40,000 active
    and accepted leads, company and product name recognition over 65% in our target
    market, and five positive product reviews per quarter. We will reach 35% market
    share in year one of sales with a headcount of twenty people, spending less than
    $4,000,000.</em>— Generate end-user demand (to match our revenue goals)— Drive
    that demand into our sales channels— Value price our products to achieve our revenue
    and margin goals (create high-value)— Educate our sales channel(s)— Help Engineering
    understand customer needs</p></blockquote><p>That was it. <strong>Two paragraphs</strong>,
    <strong>Five bullets</strong>. It didn’t take more.</p><h2><strong>Building a
    mission-focused team</strong></h2><p>Having the mission in place meant that our
    team could see that what mattered wasn’t what was on their business card, but
    how much closer their work moved our department to completing the mission. Period.</p><p>It
    wasn’t an easy concept for everyone to understand.</p><p>My new Director of Marketing
    Communications turned the Marcom departments into a mission-focused organization.
    Her new tradeshow manager quickly came to understand that his job was not to set
    up booths — we hired union laborers to do that — a trade show was where our company
    went to create awareness and/or leads. And if you ran the tradeshow department,
    you owned the responsibility for awareness and leads. The booth was incidental.
    I couldn’t care less if we had a booth or not if we could generate the same amount
    of leads and awareness by skydiving naked into a coffee cup.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/1*2J_A2kPzkrHCGykzqNREAg.jpeg\"
    alt=\"\"></p><p>The same was true for PR. My new head of Public Relations quickly
    learned that my admin could answer calls from the press. The job of Public Relations
    wasn’t a passive “write a press release and wait for something to happen” activity.
    It wasn’t measured by how busy you were, it was measured by results. And the results
    weren’t the traditional PR metrics of number of articles or inches of ink. I couldn’t
    care less about those. I wanted our PR department to map the sales process, figure
    out where getting awareness and interest could be done with PR, then get close
    and personal with the press and use it to generate end-user demand and then drive
    that demand into our sales channel. We were constantly doing internal and external
    audits and creating metrics to see the effects of different PR messages, channels
    and audiences on customer awareness, purchase intent and end-user sales.</p><p>The
    same was true for the Product Marketing group. I hired a Director of Product Marketing
    who in his last company had ran its marketing and then went out into the field
    and became its national sales director. He got the job when I asked him how much
    of his own marketing material his sales team actually used in the field. When
    he said, “about ten percent,” I knew by the embarrassed look on his face I had
    found the right guy. And our Director of Technical Marketing was superb at understanding
    customer needs and communicating them to Engineering.</p><h2><strong>Mission intent:
    What’s really important</strong></h2><p>With a great team in place, the next step
    was recognizing that our Mission statement might change on the fly. “Hey, we just
    all bought into this Mission idea and now you’re telling us it can change?!” The
    mission might change if we pivot, competitors might announce new products, we
    might learn something new about our customers, etc.</p><p>So we introduced the
    notion of <em>Mission Intent</em>. Intent answered the question, <strong>“What
    is the company thinking and goal behind the mission?”</strong> In our case, the
    mission of the company was to sell $25 million of product with 45% gross margin.</p><blockquote><h1>The
    idea of teaching intention is that if employees understand what we intended behind
    the mission, they can work collaboratively to achieve it.</h1></blockquote><p>We
    recognized that there would be a time marketing would screw up or something out
    of our control would happen, making the marketing mission obsolete (i.e. we might
    fail to deliver 40,000 leads.). Think of intention as the answer to the adage,
    “When you are up to your neck in alligators it’s hard to remember you were supposed
    to drain the swamp.” For example, our mission intent said that the reason why
    marketing needed to deliver 40,000 leads and 35% market share, etc., was so that
    Sales could sell $25 million of products at 45% gross margin.</p><p>What we taught
    everyone is that <em>the intention is more enduring than the mission — *“Let’s
    see, the company is trying to sell $25 million in product with 45% gross margin.
    If marketing can’t deliver the 40,000 leads, what else can we do for sales to
    still achieve our revenue and profitability?” *</em>The mission was our goal,
    but based on circumstances, it might change. However, <em>the Intent was immovable</em>.**</p><p>When
    faced with the time pressures of a startup, too many demands and too few people,
    we began to teach our staff to refer back to the five Mission goals and the Intent
    of the department. When stuff started piling up on their desks, they learned to
    ask themselves, “Is what I’m working on furthering these goals? If so, which one?
    If not, why am I doing it?”</p><p>They understood the mission <em>intent</em>
    was our corporate revenue and profit goals.</p><h2><strong>Why do it</strong></h2><p>By
    the end of the first year, our team had jelled. (Over time, we added the <a href=\"https://thinkgrowth.org/the-no-excuses-culture-3cef650b1088\">No
    Excuses culture</a> to solve accountability.) It was a department willing to exercise
    initiative, with the judgment to act wisely and an eagerness to accept responsibility.</p><p>I
    remember at the end of a hard week my direct reports came into my office just
    to talk about the week’s little victories. And there was a moment as they shared
    their stories when they all began to realize that our company, one that had just
    come off of life support, was beginning to kick the rear of our better-funded
    and bigger competitors. We all marveled in the moment.</p><h2><strong>Lessons
    Learned</strong></h2><ul><li><p>Push independent execution of tasks down to the
    lowest possible level</p></li><li><p>Give everyone a shared Mission Statement:
    why they come to work, what they need to do, and how they will know they have
    succeeded.</p></li><li><p>Share Mission Intent for the big picture for the Mission
    Statement</p></li><li><p>Build a team comfortable with independent Mission execution</p></li><li><p>Add
    a <a href=\"https://thinkgrowth.org/the-no-excuses-culture-3cef650b1088\">No Excuses</a>
    Culture</p></li><li><p>Agree on Core Values to define your culture</p></li></ul><p><img

  :title: What Really Kills Most Startups
  :content: '<p>“Shyp wasted too much time building something people didn’t want”</p><ul><li><p>“Formspring
    lost touch with the product vision”</p></li><li><p>“KiOR made poor hiring decisions
    as it staffed up”</p></li></ul><p>True facts, all of them! But the technical cause
    of death is usually a veneer. Behavioral, cultural, and interpersonal issues are
    among the biggest killers of startups, but they are seldom discussed in public.
    These issues are very personal. They are sometimes scary for founders to confront
    within themselves, and even scarier to confess to the world. Yet they are the
    true gems we can take away from most failed startups.</p><p>The other day I started
    digging through startup post mortems, and I came across a few founders courageous
    enough to feel their own bruises:</p><ul><li><p>“Nathan and I had major communication
    problems … we weren’t intrinsically motivated by news and journalism” —<a href="undefined">Paul
    Biggar</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@paulbiggar/why-we-shut-newstilt-down-5aba6a11136f">NewsTilt</a></p></li><li><p>“I
    started to feel burned out. I was Blurtt’s fearless leader, but the problem with
    burnout is that you become hopeless and you lose every aspect of your creativity.”
    — <a href="undefined">Jeanette Cajide</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/16/shutting-down-blurtt/">Blurtt</a></p></li><li><p>“My
    enthusiasm and perceived confidence dwindled … I grew fearful that the facade
    I had created would disappear and fearful that those around me would notice this
    lack of confidence.” — <a href="undefined">Michael Thomas</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@curious_founder/a-startup-postmortem-4a51006f19a">SkyRocket</a></p></li></ul><p>These
    posts show a beautiful vulnerability at the end of a long road. And for me they
    illustrate how a startup can be a cauldron for self-purification.</p><p>Sadly,
    most founders avoid covering the sensitive human side of things when writing a
    post mortem, especially if the company took a lot of funding. They will generally
    save face with a story cast in business school jargon. But when we <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2017/11/03/the-top-reasons-startups-fail-infographic/">keep
    telling ourselves</a> that startups die because there was “no market need” or
    they “ran out of cash,” it fuels the belief that if you can technically out-execute
    your competition, your company will surely be the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/">one
    in ten</a> startups to make it. It also cheats would-be founders out of a deeper
    understanding of what can go wrong.</p><blockquote><h1>Behavioral, cultural, and
    interpersonal issues are among the biggest killers of startups, but they are seldom
    discussed in public.</h1></blockquote><p>When a company is laser-focused on execution
    and growth at any cost, it becomes easy to build a giant backlog of fear, doubt,
    mistrust, resentment, anxiety, and stress that can lead to breakups, burnout,
    and collapse.</p><p>What’s needed is actual, selfless, humble, clear-headed leadership.
    The kind that comes from knowing oneself. As <a href="undefined">Brett Martin</a>
    wrote in <a href="https://medium.com/@brett1211/postmortem-of-a-venture-backed-startup-72c6f8bec7df">a
    thorough post mortem</a> for his venture-backed company Sonar, “Since a startup’s
    culture ultimately mirrors that of its founder, maybe the best thing that you
    can do is work hard to get clear on who you are.”</p><p>I think many people are
    afraid of what they will find when they really start looking within themselves.
    Especially the kind of highly-driven, ambitious people who start startups—people
    who may have complex inner motivations. It’s so much easier to get distracted
    by the technical details, and to believe that moving to quarterly OKRs, or doing
    more pair programming, or drinking bulletproof coffee is somehow going to be the
    key to success<em>.</em></p><p>People think startups are strictly business, but
    in my experience they are also very personal. They are in fact so personal, so
    intimate, that we’ve had to invent the idea of “strictly business” in order to
    put a safe distance between us and all of the humanity we have to face every day.
    The mistaken belief is that we need to be suitably insensitive in order to run
    a startup at all. And while a good poker face is very helpful at times, the “strictly
    business” compartmentalization also obscures our humanity, numbing us to a wealth
    of feelings and experiences that are crucial to our own development, and scrambling
    the inner compass that is the source of our deepest intrinsic motivation.</p><p>Another
    fear is that real self-inquiry could jeopardize the ego mask we employ in order
    to face the world each day. As philosophers and spiritual leaders have told us
    for thousands of years, the ego is at the root of suffering. But taking off the
    mask and examining it can be very uncomfortable.</p><p>I know these fears and
    doubts well, because I am a human. I’m a founder. I even wrote <a href="https://nerdcoach.io/story/death-by-a-thousand-great-ideas/">a
    post mortem</a> for one of my startups in 2012.</p><p>Thankfully, the grind itself
    tends to wear down the ego. Through sweat and tears and late nights at the office,
    most people can’t keep the story going forever: Eventually, fortunately, blessedly,
    they get real. With reflection, they find out who they have become. They begin
    to peer around the ego mask, and they notice that everything is shockingly clear
    on the other side: purpose, vision, values, love, and the true meaning of the
    self. A leader emerges. Unfortunately, sometimes the company has to die along
    the way.</p><p>I’ve seen this happen before my eyes. The consequences of deep
    self-reflection can be far-reaching. By going through the fire we have the chance
    to let go of old stories about ourselves and connect with a deeper personal power
    that can be life changing. And in the most difficult moments, if we’re open to
    it, growth happens incredibly fast.</p>'

    is essentially a conversion rate optimization solution, helping businesses truly
    understand how web and mobile visitors are using a site. You can look at heatmaps
    (to see where visitors are clicking and scrolling), funnels (to understand the
    points at which people are leaving your site), forms (to gain insight on and optimize
    completion rates), and a lot more. Seriously, this is an invaluable tool for tracking
    and optimizing how your marketing efforts convert. There’s a free version, but
    you can also upgrade to “pro” or “business” if you want something more robust.</p><p><img

    bugs, whether there was enough fertilizer, and enough water. (When computers,
    GPS and measurement meet farming, the category is called “<a href=\"http://www.precisionag.com/\">precision
    agriculture</a>.” I see at least one or two startup teams a year in this space.)</p><blockquote><h1>At
    the time, I pointed out to Ashwin that his Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was <strong>actionable
    data to farmers</strong> and <strong>not the drone</strong>.</h1></blockquote><p>I
    suggested that to validate their minimum viable product it would be much cheaper
    to <em>rent</em> a camera, <em>rent</em> a plane or helicopter, and fly over the
    farmers field then hand process the data and see if that’s the information farmers
    would pay for. <strong>They could do an MVP like this in a day or two, for a tenth
    of the money they were looking for.</strong></p><p>Fast forward to 2014 when Ashwin
    and I had coffee to go over what his company <a href=\"http://www.ceresimaging.net/\">Ceres
    Imaging</a> had learned. I wondered if he was still in the drone business, and
    if not, what had become of the current MVP.</p><p>It was one of those great meetings
    where all I could do was smile:</p><ol><li><p>Ashwin and the Ceres team had learned
    something that was impossible to know from inside their building.</p></li><li><p>They
    got much smarter than me.</p></li></ol><h3><strong>What customer discovery revealed:
    crop dusters</strong></h3><p>Even though the <a href=\"https://angel.co/ceres-imaging\">Ceres
    Imaging</a> founders initially wanted to build drones, talking to potential customers
    convinced them that, as I predicted, the farmers couldn’t care less how the company
    acquired the data.</p><blockquote><h1>But the farmers told them something that
    they (nor I) had even considered — <em>crop dusters, *fancy word for them are
    “aerial applicators,” *fly over farm fields all the time</em> to spray pesticides.</h1></blockquote><p>Ashwin’s
    team found that there are <a href=\"http://www.agaviation.org/content/facts-about-aerial-application-industry\">~1,400
    of these aerial applicator businesses</a> in the U.S. with ~2,800 planes covering
    farms in 44 states. Ashwin said their big “<strong>aha moment</strong>” was when
    they realized that they could use these crop dusting planes to mount their hyper-spectral
    cameras.</p><p>This is a big idea.</p><p>They didn’t need drones at all.</p><blockquote><h1>Local
    crop dusters meant they could hire existing planes and simply attach their hyper-spectral
    camera to any crop dusting plane. Ceres didn’t need to build an aerial infrastructure
    — it already existed!</h1></blockquote><p>All of sudden what was an additional
    engineering and development effort now became a small, variable cost. As a bonus
    it meant the <strong>1,400 aerial applicator companies could be a potential distribution
    channel partner</strong>.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*NduFne0I1xMMWE_Ac2t5og.png\"
    alt=\"An updated slide in Ashwin’s deck reflecting this new finding.\"><em>An
    updated slide in Ashwin’s deck reflecting this new finding.</em></p><p>The Ceres
    Imaging MVP was now an imaging system on a cropdusting plane generating data for
    high value Tree Crops.</p><blockquote><h1>Their proprietary value proposition
    wasn’t the plane or camera, but the specialized algorithms to accurately monitor
    water and fertilizer. Brilliant.</h1></blockquote><p>I asked Ashwin how they figured
    all this out. His reply, “You taught us that there were no facts inside our building.
    So we’ve learned to live with our customers. We’re now piloting our application
    with Tree Farmers in California and working with crop specialists at U.C. Davis.
    We think we have a real business.”</p><p>Since Ceras’s founding in 2014, the team
    has raised $10.5 million dollars, with the latest round announced earlier this
    month led by <a href=\"undefined\">Romulus Capital</a>. <strong>Ashwin’s story
    is a perfect example of how every startup should approach customer discovery.</strong></p><h3><strong>Lessons
    Learned</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Build continuous customer discovery into your
    company DNA.</p></li><li><p>An MVP eliminates parts of your business model that
    create complexity.</p></li><li><p>Focus on what provides immediate value for Earlyvangelists.</p></li><li><p>Add

  :title: Sex & Startups
  :content: '<p>Sex &amp; Startups</p><p>Startups, like the male anatomy, are designed
    for liquidity events. Consider the metaphors: “seed” funding, “up and to the right”
    trajectories, “acceleration,” “exit.” Paul Graham’s seminal essay “<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html">Startup
    = Growth</a>” argues that explosive growth is the only measure of success. “Making
    it” means one of two things: go public or sell.</p><p>But a startup has about
    as much chance of making it as a single sperm has of fertilizing an egg.</p><p>Look
    no further than the numbers: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/#4f89e60a55e1">90%
    of startups fail</a>. The majority <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/startup-death-data/">die</a>
    within 20 months of their last round of funding. Success equals the amount of
    money raised, or the profits made upon exit — never mind whether any value is
    generated in the world beyond capital.</p><p>Much is made about Silicon Valley’s
    culture of “innovation.” But the model for startup venture financing, and the
    system of rewards driving this supposed innovation, isn’t creative — it’s masturbatory.
    It wastes potential. It’s uninspired. It leaves founders like us staring at the
    ceiling.</p><p>Yes, we want to build businesses that succeed financially. But
    we also want so much more than that, and we aren’t alone. Most of the founders
    we know, many of whom happen to be women, are driven to build companies that generate
    money <em>and</em> meaning. And they’re in it for the long haul — not just to
    get their jollies, make their names, and exit.</p><p>We’d be lying if we said
    size doesn’t matter. We’re as excited as anyone at the prospect of making money
    from the companies we’ve built — companies we hope will grow and flourish. But
    growth is more than numbers. Growth is impact. Growth means improving our local
    communities; promoting our employees’ happiness; acquiring paying, loyal customers;
    helping users succeed; making and measuring improvements in people’s lives; and
    spurring cultural change. This is a more nuanced view of growth, but one in which
    quantity is decidedly not king.</p><p>The author and commentator Rebecca Solnit,
    <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/woolfs-darkness-embracing-the-inexplicable">in
    an essay</a> from her collection “<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/woolfs-darkness-embracing-the-inexplicable">Men
    Explain Things to Me</a>,” refers to something a friend of hers calls “the tyranny
    of the quantifiable.” In such a system, Solnit writes, <strong>“what can be measured
    almost always takes precedence over what cannot: private profit over public good;
    speed and efficiency over enjoyment and quality.”</strong> This she attributes
    partly to the failure of language to communicate the value of “slipperier things,”
    things that “cannot be named or described.”</p><p>“The tyranny of the quantifiable”
    describes the current ethos of venture financing. Imagine us on Sand Hill Road,
    in a room full of investors, with a slide deck of slippery things. They would
    laugh us out of the room. Thus founders like us are coached to lead pitches with
    the “money shot” chart, the hockey-stick-shaped revenue graph that arouses venture
    capitalists.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ZfHrpjhmygU7-bOQeZHn1w.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>In private, we squirm over how raising money <em>requires</em> faking
    it. But we don’t get off on that, and that means we don’t get off the ground.</p><p>Outside
    of bootstrapping, or relying on wealthy friends or family, or having connections
    to the limited network of mission-driven angel investors, there’s a dearth of
    options for tech companies seeking financing: It’s venture capital or bust. So
    what are founders like us to do? Where do we go from here? We see two ways forward.</p><p>In
    one version of the future, we maintain the status quo of fast, hard, and disposable.
    We continue to reward only those founders who promise to build explosive-growth
    companies. We await the arrival of the next <a href="http://fortune.com/unicorns/">billion-dollar
    unicorn</a>, crossing our fingers that a woman might break into that kingdom.
    We put contenders on the <a href="https://wholefed.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/elizabeth-holmes.jpg?w=529">covers
    of magazines</a> and shake our heads when <a href="http://recode.net/2015/07/17/cleaning-services-startup-homejoy-shuts-down-after-battling-worker-classification-lawsuits/">things
    don’t work out</a>. We watch as worthwhile startups with satisfied customers and
    respectable revenue are pejoratively rechristened “<a href="https://soundcloud.com/hearstartup/01-dating-ring-of-fire-season-2-9">lifestyle
    companies</a>.” We stand by as women angel investors shoulder the initial risk
    to support <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/its-embarrassing-how-few-black-female-founders-get-funded/">non-traditional
    founders</a>. We celebrate brave <a href="http://bryce.vc/post/130071493425/my-xoxo-talk">VC
    experiments</a> that struggle for the support of investors. We pretend that “just
    add a few women” is the magic ingredient for a balanced startup ecosystem.</p><p>But
    we don’t need more players playing the same old game. We need new rules for winning.</p><p>In
    an alternative version of the future, we create a new model: We invent another
    style of investing, one that recognizes <a href="https://medium.com/@caterina/the-age-of-the-cockroach-5a720d917416">founders</a>
    with long-term, wide-ranging visions. We focus not only on how much money is raised,
    and on investor returns, but also on how we generate value for users, elevate
    communities, and build a more equitable and inclusive system. We applaud company
    founders as contributors, <a href="https://unicornfree.com/2013/lessons-learned-from-5-years-of-saas-and-1-million-in-revenue">not
    heroes</a>. And we return to “<a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mundane">mundane</a>”
    ideals born of this world, with an emphasis on repairing, cultivating, and connecting
    rather than “disrupting,” “crushing,” “owning,” or “killing” it.</p><h2>mundane
    (adj.) mid-15c., “of this world,” from Old French mondain “of this world, worldly,
    earthly, secular”; also “pure, clean; noble, generous” (12c.), from Late Latin
    mundanus “belonging to the world”</h2><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/1*oCRy0d0aN6Pk4Rh4p57fog.jpeg"
    alt=""></p><p>So what do these mundane businesses need, if not traditional venture
    capital?</p><p>To start, they need a 21st-century digital chamber of commerce
    *and *community, made up of businesses committed to working with one another and
    local citizens. In Portland, we have begun <a href="https://medium.com/@marazepeda/introducing-the-portland-independent-chamber-of-commerce-67e01a89a28a#.qf8xonffn">such
    an effort</a>, and our members are invested in both commercial and civic growth
    and sustainability.</p><p>Companies like ours are also looking to partner with
    visionary thinkers in the banking, foundation, government, and nonprofit sectors
    to create funding alternatives. We are calling on journalists to report on who
    is being left out of the current system and why. We are seeking supporters eager
    to promote another kind of growth: one with a broad foundation that satisfies
    profit and people, and leaves everyone happy to spend more than just the night.</p><p>We
    already know who benefits from the existing model. We’re curious to know who could
    benefit from a new one. We don’t have all the answers. But if enough of us are
    up for the challenge, we’ll find the answers together. If you want in, <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/VqDPc5MNXK">join
    us</a>, and let’s reimagine a different path to prosperity.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*D2z11HgwO46DnRJa8Umkww.jpeg"

  :title: The Best Free Stuff for Startups
  :content: '<p>When you’re starting a company, there often isn’t a lot of money to
    make your business grow. Especially at the early stage, free advice, tools, and
    resources matter more than ever. We all joke about subsisting off of ramen and
    coffee, but it’s only funny because it’s true. Whether you’re wondering how to
    build a social media following, attract press attention, build a great mobile
    app, or find non-cheesy stock photos for your investor deck, you’ll find a bunch
    of useful tools on this list of free (and cheap) stuff for startups. Enjoy!</p><iframe

    This is a fancy way of saying Batch will help you and your company be smarter
    mobile developers, designers, and marketers. There are paid versions of the tool,

    send canned responses, follow particular conversations, and more. The coolest
    feature of this product is arguably the shared inboxes, which the company hopes
    will promote radical transparency within organizations. Hey — if it helps people
    spend less time going back and forth on a long email chain, we think it’s a tool

    how you can use something. As the note on the site says, “Dribbble users are nice.
    If the license is unknown, it is usually because they forgot to mention it explicitly;
    not because they were being stingy. Ask nicely and they will probably allow you

  :title: Why Startups Are Going Remote In 2018
  :content: "<p>Today’s post is written by <a href=\"undefined\">John Cunningham,</a>
    co-founder of <a href=\"https://remoterise.com/\">**Remote Rise</a><strong>, which
    helps companies big and small go remote and enjoy the benefits of a distributed
    team. At Product Hunt, we’re big fans of going remote. With 2/3rds of our team
    outside of San Francisco and spread across 9 different time zones, we rely on
    tools like <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/slack\">**Slack</a></strong>
    and <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/zoom-4\">**Zoom</a>** for communication
    within our distributed team. Read on to the see the benefit of going remote in
    2018. \U0001F30D</p><p>We’ve seen big companies like Automattic, Toptal, and GitHub
    employ large remote workforces, but we’re starting to see smaller companies like
    GitLab and Zapier <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/247907\">start
    remote, and stay remote</a>.</p><p>But why are more startups choosing a distributed
    model <strong><em>now</em></strong> more than in years past? It comes down to
    this: <strong>more startup founders are going remote because it’s a necessity
    rather than a luxury.</strong></p><p>In an increasingly competitive landscape,
    both funded and bootstrapped startups are looking for ways to be more productive
    at lower cost. When growth and efficiency hacks are more highly sought after than
    ever, remote work presents some pretty enticing upside for startups.</p><p>Here
    are a few reasons why founders are going with a distributed work model:</p><h3><strong>1.
    It makes business sense to go remote</strong></h3><p>First off, founders are kissing
    the office overhead goodbye because almost every job at a company can be done
    remotely. For example:</p><p>Ask any developer that commutes to work each day,
    and they’ll tell you that they probably wouldn’t work from an office if it was
    not required.</p><p>When it comes to hiring salespeople, most <a href=\"https://blog.pipedrive.com/2016/07/manage-remote-sales-team/\">salespeople
    are considered to be “inside sales.”</a> As someone who has sold software (inside
    sales), from both a traditional and remote office, there’s almost no difference
    other than swapping out my loud coworkers for mostly quiet dogs.</p><p>Customer
    support? They’re monitoring a dashboard on a piece of cloud based software and
    responding to issues by chat or other cloud based meeting tools.</p><p>In general,
    companies are contributing to, selling, and servicing a product that’s not usually
    housed where it’s employees work anyway. The product is almost always cloud based,
    and the employees do most of their work on other 3rd party cloud based products.
    It isn’t hard to fathom why an office might not be needed to work effectively.</p><h3><strong>2.
    Advances in enterprise software</strong></h3><p>Knowing that everyone theoretically
    could work from home at a startup has always been intriguing, but arguable not
    possible in the past. Communication technology from even a few years ago was not
    good enough to support a fully distributed team. New technology and better iterations
    of old technology have made workflow and communication faster, and in general,
    much more feasible in a remote work environment.</p><p>Remote teams <a href=\"https://remoterise.com/blog/asynchronous-communication-remote-teams/\">communicate
    with each other asynchronously for the most part</a>, meaning the time gap between
    communications can be quite large at times. In the past, remote companies were
    maybe a bit <em>too</em> asynchronous…possibly to the point of inefficiency.</p><p>Today,
    tools like <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/slack\">Slack</a>, <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/zoom-4\">Zoom</a>,
    and <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/trello-66\">Trello</a> are bridging
    the gap between synchronous and asynchronous communication. They’re re-creating
    the office experience in a virtual environment. Slack, with all of its channels,
    GIFs, and sharing features <strong>is like a virtual office</strong>, and Zoom.us
    enables teams to meet face to face.</p><iframe src=\"https://medium.com/media/3ab978b79f91fec5fb304aefa432e649\"
    frameborder=0></iframe><p>The days of communication inefficiencies on remote teams
    are gone, and all of the “water cooler moments” at offices can be replicated virtually.
    In fact, according to <a href=\"https://www.owllabs.com/state-of-remote-work\">this
    report</a>, remote workers in 2018 perform the same if not better than their onsite
    counterparts.</p><h3><strong>3. Access to a global talent pool</strong></h3><p>The
    third, and maybe most important reason that startups are going remote is <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/how-to-work-from-home-6-steps-to-land-the-perfect-.html\">access
    the global talent pool</a>.</p><p>For software companies, the norm has been to
    put down roots near a local pool of tech talent. Niche skill-sets are highly sought
    after within local talent pools, so why limit the company to one local talent
    pool?</p><p>The market for highly skilled workers in San Francisco is so competitive
    that founders are looking for talent elsewhere. It’s hard to compete with what
    Facebook and Google are offering.</p><p>Now, if a small startup finds an incredible
    senior engineer in Fargo, North Dakota, then signing up and retaining that person
    becomes a whole new ballgame. The cost of employment is lower, and companies like
    Zapier have found that remote employees tend to stick around longer (less attrition).</p><p>The
    same concept goes for <a href=\"https://blog.angel.co/how-to-pick-a-co-founder-a984b704d0cb\">finding
    a cofounder</a>. Non-technical people with dreams of starting a software company
    are going to be hard pressed to find a CTO in saturated areas. Instead of going
    head to head with well known software companies, non-technical founders might
    seek a technical cofounder outside of big tech markets. There are many reasons
    (family, and others) why a highly skilled person may not be in a position to move
    to Silicon Valley to join a small team. Remote is a viable solution for many people.</p><h3><strong>Closing
    thoughts</strong></h3><p>I worked for a tech company in the bay area about 3 years
    ago, and one day I found myself having in depth conversations with my manager
    over Slack…while he stood across from me at our bank of standup desks.</p><p>I
    remember thinking… <em>Every person in this room could be doing these exact things
    from their house</em>. Turns out I wasn’t the only person thinking that <a href=\"http://onstartups.com/startups-are-winning-the-remote-work-game.-heres-the-data-that-proves-it\">offices
    are not completely necessary for startups</a>. People like working from home.
    According to <a href=\"https://www.flexjobs.com/2017-State-of-Telecommuting-US/\">this
    report</a>, remote work went up by 115% from 2005–2015 and continues to climb
    today.</p><p>Today, communication tools have gotten to a high enough level and
    the talent pool is so competitive in certain areas, that it doesn’t make sense
    to start a company with one physical location. From what I’ve learned working
    at a few remote software startups, if I were to start a company tomorrow, it would
    be a no-brainer to go remote.</p><iframe src=\"https://medium.com/media/9ba92ec90f7d6da8671c030dbb024ba8\"

  :title: Startups are Financial Suicide
  :content: '<p>Photo by Freddie Collins</p><p>In 2009 when I left Google, I had over
    $100,000 in my bank account. I don’t say that to boast. I worked hard to save
    that money, and did so because I wanted to create a startup.</p><p>Nine years
    later, my bank balance is a fraction of that. I also don’t expect to ever see
    a return from my startup.* It’s embarrassing to admit, but I’ve gone backwards.
    (No need to feel sorry for me — I’ll be fine! This article is actually about you.)</p><p>Today
    having a startup is all the rage. They’re basically fashion accessories. On one
    hand, that’s great! The world needs more innovation. There’s also a massive amount
    to learn when you run things yourself. But please, be smart. Don’t be like me.</p><p>The
    problem was my mentality. I felt certain, one way or another, the startup would
    succeed. That made me feel really safe! In fact I would often drift to sleep enjoying
    that beautiful (but irrational) thought. Consequently I didn’t take my immediate
    money situation seriously. It was temporary! Saving didn’t matter. 401K / superannuation
    didn’t matter. All I needed to focus on was “maximising shareholder value” and
    the rest would follow.</p><p>Over the next few months I want to publish more of
    what I’ve learned in the last 9 years. But, before I do, I wanted to make one
    thing clear: startups are extremely dangerous!</p><p>That should have been obvious
    to me, right? For some reason it wasn’t. I thought the rules didn’t apply.</p><p>Don’t
    get fooled thinking raising lots of money will save you, or having lots of customers
    will save you. We raised over $25m and sold millions of dollars of product to
    real customers. Over 90% of startups die. Statistically speaking, yours will too.</p><p>Things
    I wished I did:</p><ul><li><p>improve the financial fundamentals of our business
    sooner,</p></li><li><p>raise less money,</p></li><li><p>live even more frugally,
    saving at least 20% — ideally 40%,</p></li><li><p>cut up my credit card (even
    though I always paid it in full),</p></li><li><p>obtain a second or a third source
    of income — driving for Uber on Saturday night doesn’t sound so crazy now, and</p></li><li><p>take
    my 401K / superannuation seriously.</p></li></ul><p>A great book — particularly
    if you live in Australia — is <a href="https://amzn.to/2t0V02C">The Barefoot Investor</a>.
    You might think that advice only applies to people with real jobs. Ha. That’s
    what I thought! Turns out, I did have a “real” job — just a low paying one.</p><p>By
    all means, start a company. It’s one of the most rewarding things you can do — even
    if you fail. But if you’re a founder (or an early employee) please don’t rely
    on your shares to make you rich. That’s quite improbable. Instead, focus on getting
    rich today, slowly. One dollar at a time. Like everyone else.</p><p>If you’d like
    to read more of my articles, please subscribe.</p><p>(* To be clear, my startup
    is still very much alive and, apparently, well. I left the company over a year
    ago. Although I might get a return in the future, I have no way of knowing what
    the probability of that might be. I’ve now made peace with the fact it might be
    zero.)</p>'

  :title: We need to talk about startups…
  :content: "<p>We’re partying like it’s 1999 all over again.</p><p>“Man, Kevin Systrom
    really fucked up <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2012/04/09/facebook-buys-instagram-for-1-billion-wheres-the-revenue/\">selling
    Instagram for a billion</a>.” I was at SFO, about to fly home after a couple days
    in San Francisco, and couldn’t help but overhear the guy behind me talking loudly
    to his nodding friend. There’s a weird phenomenon happening right now in tech:
    a billion dollars just doesn’t seem like a lot of money anymore. A couple years
    ago, our collective jaws would drop when a startup got acquired for $25 million.
    Now, people don’t even bat an eye until well into the billions.</p><p>Maybe a
    billion really is the new million. After all, the world is changing at an accelerating
    pace. The internet and mobile computing have taken hold, and it seems like a new
    era of exponential growth has arrived. Every day, entrepreneurs are unseating
    taxi czars and hotel magnates using little more than smart phones and a healthy
    disregard for the rules. In this crazy new world, it seems like just about anyone
    can build the next billion-dollar startup, whether it’s Uber for dry cleaning,
    or AirBnB for dogs.</p><p>If this seems strangely familiar, that’s because it
    is. In 1999, at the height of the dot com bubble, there were billion dollar IPOs
    and acquisitions happening weekly, often of startup companies with non-existent
    business models based on “eyeballs” or “stickiness”. Who can forget Yahoo’s bonehead
    acquisitions of <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB917899592278264000\">Geocities
    for $3.57 billion</a>, and <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/1999/04/01/deals/yahoo/\">Broadcast.com
    for $5.7 billion</a>? Or food delivery startup WebVan, which with just $5 million
    in revenue and negative margins, went public and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webvan\">achieved
    a market cap of over $8 billion</a> before <a href=\"https://home.chicagobusiness.com/clickshare/authenticateUserSubscription.do?CSProduct=crainschicago-metered&CSAuthReq=1:1735662298050:AID:39C15DA94282E771F17046F5F85F9ADD&AID=/20010709/NEWS/20002787&title=Webvan%20closes%20online%20grocer&CSTargetURL=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20010709/NEWS/20002787/webvan-closes-online-grocer\">floundering
    and declaring bankruptcy</a> just two years later.</p><p>This time it’s a little
    different. Most of these companies have some revenue. Some even have a little
    profit. Fewer companies are rushing to IPO, and instead staying private for longer.
    But in many ways, it’s starting to feel like we’re partying like it’s 1999. We
    may not be there yet, and it may not take the same form, but something is most
    certainly brewing. As Mark Twain once said, “history doesn’t repeat itself, but
    it does rhyme”.</p><h3><strong>Here’s a couple fun facts:</strong></h3><p>• This
    year, The Super Bowl had the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/super-bowl-gets-a-spike-in-newbie-advertisers-1421876156\">most

    23 newly minted tech billionaires</a> to The Rich List.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/san-francisco-neighborhoods-where-one-bedrooms-are-expensive-2014-8\">San
    Francisco rental rates are through the roof</a>. The average 1-bedroom costs over
    $3,000/mo (and goes up from there), <a href=\"http://sf.curbed.com/archives/2014/09/09/yikes_bay_area_rents_are_up_almost_15_percent_since_last_year.php\">up
    15% in the past year</a>.</p><p>• The <em>average</em> programmer is <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/tech-salaries-have-hit-a-new-record-2014-10\">fetching
    upwards of $130,000/year</a> in San Francisco, before stock options and bonuses.
    But that’s small potatoes, some are so in demand that <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/programmers-price\">they
    have their own agents</a>.</p><p>• High profile investors like Bill Gurley and

    should be worried</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Silicon Valley as a whole or that the
    venture-capital community or startup community is taking on an excessive amount
    of risk right now. Unprecedented since \x91’99. In some ways less silly than ’99

    P/E of 27</a>, inline with 1929 and 2007 levels, and exceeded only by 1999. Once

    public at a breakneck pace</a> and <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/10/investing/ipo-price-warning-dot-com-era/\">without

    year, it was 71%, up from 46% in 2012, and that <a href=\"http://www.tableau.com/public/gallery/ipoprofitability\">doesn’t
    bode well for future investor returns</a>.</p><p>• Instead of going public — which
    is subject to rigorous auditing and regulation — many companies are <a href=\"http://abovethecrowd.com/2015/02/25/investors-beware/\">raising
    massive private rounds based on dubious math</a>. And many of the tech companies
    that have gone public are proudly trumpeting profitability but <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ycharts/2012/12/14/salesforce-com-22-billion-market-cap-no-profits-nice-place-to-work-especially-for-ceo-benioff/\">aren’t</a>

    trading at high P/E and sales multiples, driving up private valuations.</p><p>•
    There are hundreds of new startups launching daily, so many that there are popular
    startups dedicated to keeping track of them. One such startup, <a href=\"http://www.producthunt.com\">ProductHunt</a>,

    money at a $22 million valuation</a>. Many of these startups rely on other startups
    and startup founders for all of their revenue.</p><p>Don’t take this the wrong
    way. I love startups and technology, and regardless of all this, there are a lot
    of amazing things happening. Artificial intelligence is showing signs of life.
    Self-driving cars are on the way, and drones may soon be delivering our toothpaste.
    There’s no doubt that there is an incredible amount of innovation happening right
    now.</p><p>This isn’t to say that <em>what</em> all these startups are working
    on is necessarily bad, only that the underlying financials create a situation
    that will likely lead to a correction. The mean is up and to the right — innovation
    is alive and well — but I’m concerned that these valuations are completely unsustainable
    and a lot of investors, founders, and hundreds of thousands of employees, are
    going to get clobbered in the coming years.</p><p>But hey, who knows? Maybe history
    isn’t going to repeat itself and exponential technology growth has kicked in.
    Maybe Uber is worth $500 billion. Maybe I’ll look back at this post in five years
    and cringe. All I know, is that I’m putting my swim trunks on…</p><blockquote><p>“You

    have staying power.</p></li><li><p>*<em>GARP (Growth at A Reasonable Price)*</em>There
    are many business models where it’s a no brainer to continue to funnel cash back
    into customer acquisition and growth (if LTV&gt;CAC, for instance). By all means,
    keep drinking your competitor’s milkshake, but you want the ability to hit the
    brakes and skid to a stop instead of careening over the red line and off a cliff.
    Fred Wilson recently <a href=\"http://avc.com/2015/06/profits-vs-growth/\">wrote
    a great post</a> where he shared a formula for burn: your year over year growth
    rate plus your pre-tax operating margins need to be at least forty percent. It
    could mean the difference between some layoffs/budget cuts and liquidation.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Watch
    out for fixed costs*</em>Employees can be laid off, but your $100,000/mo office
    space that sports a games room and cafeteria with an executive chef is locked
    into a 5-year lease and isn’t going anywhere. Every dollar of fixed costs weighs
    you down from being able to take evasive action in the event of a crisis. There’s
    a balance to be made between space to grow and impress new recruits vs. what you
    actually need to run the business.</p></li><li><p>*<em>Cash is king*</em>If you’re
    operating on the idea that you’ll be able to raise another round whenever you
    want, you may want to consider drafting a backup plan. Run the model: if you could
    never raise another round of funding, what would happen to your company? A healthy
    balance sheet and low burn gives you the longevity to weather the storm as you
    watch your competitors run out of cash, and, if you so desire, buy their technology
    out of liquidation at pennies on the dollar. Think of your bank balance as the
    moat around your castle, protecting you from the mongol hordes coming over the
    hill.</p></li></ol><p>A lot of this is just common sense business fundamentals,
    but I’ve always been surprised by how few people in the tech world pay attention
    to this stuff. The past seven years have been good to startups — it’s been a non-stop
    feast. It’s easy to slip into thinking a huge round, lucrative acquisition, or
    IPO is just around the corner, but it’s a valuable exercise to think through what
    would happen if the music stopped.</p><p><em>You should <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/awilkinson\">follow

  :title: Consumer startups are dead. Long live consumer startups.
  :content: '<p>“It is a dark time for the Rebellion”</p><blockquote><h1>— The Empire
    Strikes Back</h1></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*ehAkpBA4keWeYS4P"
    alt=""></p><p>Ten years ago this month on July 10, 2008, Apple first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/07/10/app-store-launches-upgrade-itunes-now/">unveiled</a>
    the App Store and kicked off one of the greatest periods of product innovation,
    entrepreneurial achievement, and disruption of the establishment we’ve ever seen,
    namely the <strong>Consumer Rebellion</strong>. Like what the Internet Rebellion
    had done 10 years before, the Consumer Rebellion would spawn startups that evolved
    from tiny companies into titans of industry, all fueled by the introduction of
    a new computing platform: the smartphone. In <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/371889/smartphone-worldwide-installed-base/">2008</a>
    there were 237 million smartphone users. 5 years later that number would grow
    more than 6 times to 1.4 billion. And today there are almost 3 billion smartphone
    users. To provide some context as to how impressive that growth is, <strong>the
    smartphone is arguably the fastest spreading technology in the history of all
    technology</strong>.</p><p>Who was a member of the Rebellion? In 2009, Pinterest,
    WhatsApp, and Uber all launched. In 2010, Instagram and Xiaomi. In 2011, Snapchat.
    And in 2012, Toutiao. These are some of the most iconic consumer companies around,
    that touch more than a billion mobile users every day and have become fundamental
    parts of our society, all founded in consecutive years between 2009 and 2012.
    Truly once-in-a-generation, outsized consumer businesses, that made eleven figure
    valuations seem routine, were somehow being started <strong>every single year
    for four years straight</strong>. This was as hot of a streak as you can possibly
    have.</p><p>The Consumer Rebellion was in full force. It was unstoppable. Until
    2013 at least.</p><h2>The Golden Age</h2><p>To illustrate the timeline of the
    Consumer Rebellion, let’s look at data courtesy of the good people at <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com">Crunchbase</a>.
    I’ve queried all consumer unicorns (consumer startups that have achieved a lofty
    billion dollar valuation) since 2005 and plotted them by their founding date.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Z4Oh6o6Gk8bqeyTZ" alt=""></p><p>As
    expected, there’s a steep spike starting in 2009, exactly when the mobile app
    economy began with the App Store launch and subsequent founding of consumer giants
    like Airbnb and Instagram. But curiously, there’s a similar steep decline in 2013
    forming a nice bell curve. <strong>This golden age of consumer startups emerged
    from 2009 to 2012 and then declined afterwards.</strong></p><p>But maybe the picture
    is simply incomplete. Companies take time to develop right? For example, a great
    consumer startup founded in 2018 will take several years to mature and grow in
    value so obviously there will be fewer consumer unicorns this year simply because
    of the time horizon we’re looking at. Yes, there’s definite truth to that point.
    When evaluated in the fullness of time, there will absolutely be more than zero
    consumer unicorns from this current 2018 vintage.</p><p>But that doesn’t explain
    the decline in 2013 and 2014. Those companies have now had 4 or 5 years to develop,
    which is a long enough period to allow for the winners to have separated themselves
    by now. In other words, the unicorns of the 2013 and 2104 vintages of consumer
    companies should have matured already, and the number of consumer unicorns won’t
    change substantially even if we wait several more years.</p><p>To illustrate that
    point, let’s look at the same chart but add in enterprise unicorns.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*2L7_cjtf7XY74XSk" alt=""></p><p>The
    rate of hit enterprise startups has been quite consistent, which makes this Golden
    Age for consumer startups — the Consumer Rebellion — even more apparent. But the
    most interesting thing is what happened in 2013 and 2014. As the number of consumer
    unicorns declined steeply, the number of enterprise unicorns held up. In other
    words, enough time has passed for hit enterprise startups from 2013 and 2014 to
    break out, making those vintages mature. Yes, it’s probably too early to tell
    how companies founded between 2015 and 2018 will ultimately perform and we’ll
    see more unicorns emerge from those vintages in the fullness of time. But it’s
    not too early to draw conclusions for companies founded in 2013 and 2014, both
    enterprise and consumer.</p><p>And the conclusion I’m drawing is that the odds
    of success for the Rebellion got a lot worse starting in 2013.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*8vZUkwEcvpzpTNbW"
    alt=""></p><h2>The Empire Strikes Back</h2><p>Although the past 5 years has certainly
    produced some great consumer startups, it has not kept up with the record pace
    of the hot streak from 2009 to 2012 that was the Consumer Rebellion. Again, many
    of the best consumer startups in the history of consumer startups were founded
    in that remarkable four year span. Think Uber, Pinterest, and Snapchat and that
    leads to the question of where is the next Uber, the next Pinterest, and the next
    Snapchat?</p><p>What happened to the Consumer Rebellion? Did the underlying consumer
    behavior around the growth of smartphone usage change? The answer there is absolutely
    not. Mobile usage is stronger than ever with more than 1.5 billion new smartphone
    users added since 2013. But the primary beneficiary of that consumer demand in
    mobile has changed. The startups of the Rebellion benefited tremendously from
    2009 to 2012. But from 2013 on, the spoils of smartphone growth went to an entirely
    different group: <strong>the Empire</strong>.</p><p>The Empire are the market
    leaders of consumer tech, the establishment, the once underdog David’s who are
    now the dominant Goliath’s. This includes the original Rebellion pioneers like
    Uber, Pinterest, and Snapchat that have now graduated from promising startups
    to bonafide industry giants. But no one embodies the Empire more than the vaunted
    FAANG: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google.</p><p>In 2008 when the App
    Store first launched, not a single member of FAANG was among the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/18/biz_2000global08_The-Global-2000_MktVal.html">Top
    30</a> most valuable companies in the world by market capitalization. Fast forward
    ten years, that group of five has collectively increased in value by approximately
    3 trillion dollars such that all but one of those companies (Netflix) is now ranked
    among the <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/audit-services/assets/pdf/global-top-100-companies-2018-report.pdf">Top
    10</a> most valuable companies in the world. And that laggard (Netflix), happens
    to be the fastest growing amongst all of FAANG, having increased its market cap
    by 100 times since 2008.</p><p>But more interesting is when you look at when that
    rocket ship growth happened. <strong>80% of the value of FAANG was generated after
    2013</strong>. Here’s a chart that illustrates this:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*XRfW4jigW1Sfn8kH"
    alt=""></p><p>The growth before 2013 was impressive, but the growth after 2013
    has been absolutely explosive. And in the above chart, I had to even leave out
    Netflix because when you add in their growth since 2013, the slope is so steep
    that it makes the other companies look nearly flat!</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*BpSr0c6IPysrj0RR"
    alt=""></p><p>Also consider that in the past five years, Snapchat has grown 20,000%
    in value, Toutiao 10,000%, Uber 2,000%, and Pinterest and Xiaomi 600%. And Instagram’s
    <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-25/value-of-facebook-s-instagram-estimated-to-top-100-billion">estimated</a>
    $100 billion valuation estimate makes it one of the most successful corporate
    acquisitions ever with an astounding 10,000% valuation gain. So it’s not just
    FAANG. For the startups who were able to break out before 2013, the last five
    years has widened their lead. <strong>Whereas 2009 to 2012 created new market
    leaders, 2013 to 2018 reinforced established market leaders</strong>.</p><h2>Network
    effects, distribution, and talent oh my!</h2><p>The Rebellion has stalled and
    the Empire has absolutely dominated the post App Store world. Why? What contributing
    factors led to the Empire striking back so thunderously?</p><p>It starts first
    and foremost with the <strong>network effects</strong> that the Empire has that
    translated so well to the smartphone. The world has seen dominant consumer companies
    before — from Walmart to Disney to Nike to AOL — but never consumer companies
    that had this ability to connect all their mobile users together for the benefit
    of the entire ecosystem. More Snapchat users leads to better content shared and
    choices for people to instantly communicate with (direct network effect). More
    Apple iPhone users leads to better network infrastructure like 4G that improves
    the mobile experience (indirect network effect). More Uber drivers leads to cheaper
    and faster rides for passengers (two sided network effect). And so forth. The
    Empire grows stronger with every like, share, click, ride, pin, post, watch, buy,
    publish, and subscribe.</p><p>Next, every consumer company obviously needs consumers
    to be successful, and the Empire has <strong>unparalleled distribution advantages</strong>.
    Facebook and Google’s distribution power is obvious and it’s no coincidence that
    those two companies have <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/08/25/facebook-google-tech-companies-billion-users/">11
    products</a> between them that each have more than 1 billion monthly active users.
    But Netflix and Amazon also have tremendous distribution advantages. Netflix <a
    href="https://www.multichannel.com/news/netflix-has-lowest-churn-rate-among-ott-services-study-404142">retains</a>
    their subscribers better than anyone in the business — less than 1% cancel each
    month, which is about 5 times better than other video subscription services. That
    allows them to spend <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2018/01/23/netflixs-83-million-new-subscribers-didnt-come-che.aspx">more
    for each subscriber</a> (about $100) than other services because subscribers will
    stick around longer to payback that marketing expense. Amazon has launched 100
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/business/amazon-the-brand-buster.html?nytmobile=0">private
    label brands</a> and grown them quickly because they can redirect shopping traffic
    towards their own products. For example, Amazon’s private label isn’t just the
    preferred option when purchasing batteries through Alexa; it’s the only option.
    So perhaps not as obvious as Facebook and Google, Netflix and Amazon’s distribution
    powers are just as potent.</p><p>Finally, it takes world class product and engineering
    talent to build great consumer products and the Empire has amassed one of the
    <strong>largest and most talented army of builders in the world</strong>. Amazon
    is the single largest spender in the entire country on <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/4/9/17204004/amazon-research-development-rd">research
    and development</a> at $22.6 billion dollars last year. Apple, Google, and Facebook
    aren’t far behind as all three rank in the Top 10. And not only is the Empire
    army the biggest on the field, they are also given unique insights and capabilities
    that no one else has. For example, Apple iOS application engineers can utilize
    features of the platform (known as <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/06/13/apple_inches_toward_openness/">private
    APIs</a>) that other mobile developers are not allowed to use in their apps.</p><p>A
    network effect to engage your users, AND preferred distribution channels to grow,
    AND the best resources to build products? Oh my! It’s no wonder why the Empire
    has captured so much smartphone value and created a dark time for the Rebellion.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*fClIK4YmD-iyTysP" alt=""></p><h2>Consumer
    startups are dead. Long live consumer startups.</h2><p>As a consumer startup investor,
    it’s humbling how hard it is to determine what are the right consumer companies
    to invest in and then go earn the privilege of working with those talented entrepreneurs.
    Most of the investment decisions we make end up being <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/dissecting-startup-failure-by-stage-34bb70354a36">wrong</a>.
    But when the decision is right, that right can be a really big success. In fact,
    investors depend on that right decision being outsized to make up for all the
    wrong decisions we inevitably make along the way. That’s just the nature of our
    business — <strong>it’s hits driven</strong> — which is why I take particular
    interest in understanding if there’s something limiting the creation of hit consumer
    companies. Is the Consumer Rebellion over? Has the Empire put an end to the next
    wave of breakout consumer startups being founded?</p><p>One word: no.</p><p><img
    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*khWZhmrc1zWKehIp" alt=""></p><p>The
    Empire’s advantages — network effects, preferred distribution channels, and talent
    resources — are incredibly formidable, but not insurmountable. Let’s try and overcome
    them one at a time.</p><h3>Network Effects</h3><p>The network effects of the Empire
    are arguably their most frightening advantage. The value provided by network effects
    <a href="https://medium.com/evergreen-business-weekly/the-power-of-network-effects-why-they-make-such-valuable-companies-and-how-to-harness-them-5d3fbc3659f8">grows
    exponentially</a>. And at the scale of the Empire companies, the user benefits
    are so tremendous that it’s incredibly hard to build an alternative that delivers
    enough value to be competitive.</p><p>So what’s the solution? Simply avoid competing.</p><p><strong>Mobile
    users are so savvy and product fluent these days that they are comfortable using
    multiple services simultaneously</strong>. The average mobile user:</p><ul><li><p>Is
    active on nearly <a href="https://www.globalwebindex.net/blog/internet-users-have-average-of-5-social-media-accounts">3
    social networking services</a></p></li><li><p>Has over <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/data-gallery/detail/average-number-shopping-apps-installed/">4
    shopping apps</a> installed on their phone</p></li><li><p>Communicates on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activates-michael-wolf-predicts-whats-next-for-tech-and-media-in-2017-1477436031">2
    messaging apps</a></p></li><li><p>Subscribes to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activates-michael-wolf-predicts-whats-next-for-tech-and-media-in-2017-1477436031">2
    on demand video services</a></p></li></ul><p>Again, that’s the <strong>average
    user</strong> (not just the advanced users) who is regularly switching between
    multiple services instead of staying on a single service, even in the categories
    that the Empire dominates. So to gain traction in a consumer category, a disruptive
    startup does not have to defeat and displace an incumbent defended by a network
    effects moat. As Sun Tzu once <a href="http://www.military-quotes.com/Sun-Tzu.htm">said</a>,
    “On contentious ground, attack not”. <strong>A startup can avoid the direct battle
    and exist alongside the incumbent because users have proven capable and willing
    of adopting multiple services</strong>.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>The App Store
    <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/charts/free-apps/">Top Free Apps</a> list
    is a barometer for consumer startup success. Every great consumer company since
    2008 has appeared on this list so it is closely watched by investors, entrepreneurs,
    operators, the Rebellion, and the Empire alike. In the beginning, the Top Free
    Apps list was dynamic, constantly changing with promising contenders for the attention
    of users. But again, something changed in 2013.</p><p>Below, I’ve looked at one
    day (July 1st) for each year since 2013 and plotted how many new, non-gaming apps
    made it into the Top 100 and Top 500 apps in the United States. I defined “new”
    as being launched within the past 2 years, and I excluded gaming apps because
    rankings fluctuate so heavily for gaming apps that appearing on the list is not
    a consistent indicator of success.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*hS7HPAjOvk6hqOiw"
    alt=""></p><p>The trend is clear. On July 1, 2013, there were 171 promising new
    apps ranked on the Top 500 and 29 that broke through into the Top 100. So while
    the popular apps were mostly incumbents, new startups occupied 30% of the top
    spots so there was still competition to be an icon on a user’s phone. But on July
    1, 2018, those numbers had dwindled to 55 in the Top 500 and only 4 that cracked
    the Top 100 list. Now startups are fighting for only 5% of the top spots as the
    Top Free Apps list is dominated by incumbents. Facebook (4 apps), Google (6 apps),
    and Amazon (4 apps) <strong>EACH</strong> have as many apps in the Top 100 list
    as all the new startups combined.</p><p>While the percentage of new apps in the
    App Store most popular lists is low, the key is that it’s not zero. Every day,
    a small number of new apps still continue to fight the good fight for consumer
    attention, and even occasionally win. Here are a few apps that launched in the
    past 3 years that hit number one in the App Store for at least one day:</p><ul><li><p>Sarahah</p></li><li><p>TBH</p></li><li><p>FaceApp</p></li><li><p>Hooked</p></li><li><p>Face
    Swap Live</p></li><li><p>Live.ly</p></li></ul><p>These companies didn’t just reach
    number one in a specific category. <strong>They hit number one overall, the single
    most popular app in this entire country, more popular for that moment than the
    mighty Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube</strong>. Over that time frame,
    there were dozens more consumer apps that made it into the Top 10, capturing the
    attention of millions of people.</p><p>5% may be a small percentage, but again
    it’s not zero and even more important that 5% rate has held constant for apps
    in the Top 100 list over the past 4 years. While the door isn’t open as wide as
    it was before, it’s still open and holding open. Consumer startups still have
    a chance. For entrepreneurs, a chance is all that we ask for. And in a Rebellion,
    a chance is sometimes all that’s needed.</p><h3>Resources</h3><p>If you go to
    LinkedIn and search for people with “product” or “engineer” in their job title
    at any of the FAANG companies, you’ll get about 100,000 results back. That’s a
    very intimidating number. And the actual number is surely higher than that, and
    there far more companies in the Empire besides FAANG who all have armies of builders
    of their own.</p><p>Back when I worked at Microsoft, resourcing was both a sign
    of success and an indicator of success. Your project wasn’t important unless you
    had a hundred engineers working on it, and it wasn’t going well unless you were
    getting even more headcount each year. But a wonderful thing is happening with
    product development: technology is making creating technology easier and cheaper.
    The Internet got rid of long development, testing, and maintenance cycles that
    came with dealing in physical media. Cloud and virtualization got rid of having
    to purchase and operate server hardware. Service based architecture and open source
    got rid of having to build every part of your product from scratch because you
    could efficiently leverage the work of others.</p><p><strong>Because of the rapidly
    decreasing time, resources, and costs involved, everyone has a chance to build
    great products</strong>, both the Rebellion and the Empire alike. Technology is
    no longer a numbers game, and it’s more accessible than ever before, which blunts
    the resource advantage of the Empire. Take for example Intermedia Labs, the talented
    team behind the hit app HQ Trivia. In less than one year, they released 3 high
    quality apps (Hype, Bounce, and HQ Trivia) all funded by a single round of venture
    funding with an engineering team less than 10 people. Not to be outdone, the folks
    at Joya Communication released 6 different apps (Cleo Video, FlipLip, Any Video,
    Evercam, Joya Video, Video Gems) in 3 years before landing on their 7th, the hit
    app Marco Polo. And that was also on on a single round of funding with a similar
    small team.</p><p>To paraphrase the The Six Million Dollar Man, companies of all
    shapes and sizes, startups and incumbents alike, have access to the technology.
    We can rebuild the Consumer Rebellion.</p><h2>The Return of the Consumer Rebellion</h2><p>No
    one ever said entrepreneurship is easy. Startup success is hard to achieve, and
    consumer startup success is more challenging than ever given the dominant positions
    of the current crop of market leaders. The world of industry has never seen incumbents
    before with this much talent, scale, profitability, and ambition, driven to heights
    previously unimaginable by powerful network effects. What chance does any new
    company have against such a daunting opponent?</p><p>Yet looking back through
    history, IBM was the pinnacle of a technology success until Microsoft, which was
    the pinnacle of a technology success until Google, which was the pinnacle of technology
    success until Facebook, and so on. Less than a decade ago, we witnessed one of
    the greatest hot streaks ever for consumer startups, the Consumer Rebellion. An
    entire crop of amazing companies grew from humble beginnings to world changing
    forces not that long ago. Now there are reasons to believe it can happen again,
    from consumers adopting multiple services, to apps still becoming breakout hits
    overnight, to technology becoming more accessible to builders of all shapes and
    sizes.</p><p>So was the Consumer Rebellion from 2009 to 2012 the last hope for
    consumer startup success?</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*fwHjbgsM_JBjILYL"
