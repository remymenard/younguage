### **Tiered System and SuperFan Digital Stadium**

SportsFix employs the integration of blockchain and OTT creating a digital stadium ecosystem. The digital stadiums are tiered, based on an algorithmic formula, built to incentivize respective fan bases to watch livestream matches and spur community growth.

There are five different types of Digital Stadiums. The first four tiered Digital Stadium include Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. While SuperFan Digital Stadium is a unique independent stadium dedicated for our official sports clubs partners.

Our algorithmic formula calculates the projected content cost for the game, feature cost, and hosting cost. After dividing those costs with number in attendances, the formula optimizes which digital stadium will be released for the fan bases.

### **Digital Stadium Features**

The Digital Stadium features are divided into three categories of basic, custom, and marketplace.

Entering with Bronze Digital Stadium, fans will start with four different features including to watch live games and videos on demand, to pledge SFT for the desired content, use SFT to purchase game day passes or subscribe as a digital season pass holder, and share activities on their social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter). Our Silver, Gold, and Platinum will start with a complete set of basic features, with two extra features of wallet and leaderboard group.

The most exciting part is, as the community of fan bases grow, fans are collectively able to move up the digital stadium tiers to unlock various custom features to enhance their viewing experience! The custom features will include, but not limited to message, leaderboard, customized stickers, multistream, user generated content (UGC), bandwidth, DVR/time-shift, HD video, user generated commentary, cut/paste scenes to support UGC, Gifting, and prediction (see table below).
