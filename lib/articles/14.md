# Hi! We’re Changing the Way You Watch Sports.

Hi Everyone!

It’s the team here at SportsFix and we’re so excited to join the Medium community. This summer, we’ll be launching our ICO for our platform with the issuance of SportsFix Token (SFT) and we’d like to be part of the Steemit community to share our project, our perspective, excitement and insights to engage in an ongoing discussion around using Blockchain technology to disrupt the sports media industry as well as collaborate on ways to bring Blockchain to the mainstream.

Like most sports fans, if you ever want to watch your favorite sports teams play, you’ll have to watch it on TV since access to a physical stadium is limited and the time constraints of our daily schedules and distance to get to the stadium are big barriers to watching the game live and in-person. But even trying to catch your favorite team play live on TV can be really tricky for most people. If you’re lucky, you’ll be able to catch the game at home on live broadcast — but free viewing of live sports games is very limited. Think about it, there are only a few primetime games on TV at any given time. So for most at home viewers, watching the game usually entails signing up for a really expensive cable package which includes a ton of channels and games that you’ll never watch. This results in a large proportion of would be viewers missing the game and resorting to watching highlights.

We’ve realized that this is one of many problems for sports fans, so we launched our SportsFix platform last year — which was designed to bring the live sports game to displaced fans, no matter where they are. Our streaming OTT sports platform is now live in selected countries in ASEAN — Indonesia and Malaysia — and is powered by our content partnerships with content rights holders, leagues like CSL, BWF, Serie A and Liga 1. Our Telco partnerships in the region give us a wide reach — giving us access to over 300M+ people in the region.

With our upcoming ICO, our goal is to change the way fans access and watch streaming sports content — we’ve created a Digital Stadium and a fan driven token economy to allow fans to do benefit by:

* Accessing content you want to see.

* Pay only for the content you want to watch.

* Participate in the Digital Stadium — customize your viewing experience, watch and engage with other fans and have the in-stadium experience on your phone.

* Direct engagement with your favorite sports clubs.

* Earn tokens and get free Game Day Passes from your favorite clubs and sponsors.

We believe the blockchain will allow us executing our plans by creating a decentralized ecosystem for sports content and ultimately putting the control back in the hands of fans so they can watch what the games they want, pay for what they watch and customize their viewing experience.

We’ll be sharing more details with you about our upcoming ICO as well as more insights and our perspective in the coming weeks — so stay in the loop and stay IN THE GAME by subscribing or following us in the channels listed below.
