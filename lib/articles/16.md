We’re going to focus on new technology trends and platforms that is creating an opportunity to upgrade the fan to club relationship that will allow for higher engagement and personalization.

Two major challenges face sports fans and their favorite club. The first is accessibility to live game content outside the traditional broadcast network and the second is direct participation, recognition, and engagement with the club outside of limited digital platforms like youtube, twitter, and facebook. These legacy platforms do not allow clubs the ability to deeply access users information to create a better experience of direct communication.

Fans are craving and demanding a sports-focused all-in-one platform that integrates and enhances the Live game watching experience.

## **Displaced Fans**

So why are there millions displaced fans worldwide who cannot access and watch their favorite teams?

These groups and individuals are those who have a high identification with its origin but live in a different region or even separate country –for example, an English expat living in Malaysia that is a Liverpool fan.

Sounds like location is an issue –that they are not in close proximity to see live games in the ‘traditional’ stadium. But it is also a paradox in the digital era.

Normally, traditional national-based broadcast channels don’t show sports content from another nation. The geographical boundary limits them due to geo location content rights, subscriber, economic, and technology restrictions. And even if the displaced fan is watch live games, they will be charged for exorbitant content packages.

## **Lack of Direct Fan Engagement**

One way communication is obsolete and limiting. Yet, there is little to no two-way communication between clubs and fans happening in today’s typical fan experience.

Big clubs, such as Manchester United and Real Madrid, may now have digital platforms to directly engage with their fans across the globe. However for smaller leagues or clubs across the globe, financial constraints in developing a coherent digital strategy to reach displaced fans remain a challenge.

On the other side, traditional broadcasters do not have the capability in creating a better viewing measurement system, utilizing cross-platform measurement companies such as Nielsen or Comscore to help profiling audiences. This may not be in line with the digital media influence within the online sports fans engagement due to increasing restrictions and regulations in using users data. As a consequence, the traditional distribution system has put fans on a passive role.

Yes, fans have been at the passenger seat for more than three decades.

But SportsFix is here to change that! We are establishing a digital ecosystem where fans and clubs worldwide can take active roles, backed by blockchain technology and smart contracts.

We believe the SportsFix experience can combine the best of both worlds with a premium viewing experience and bringing camaraderie of fandom into the digital world allowing clubs to create a deeper and more enriching relationship to the fan.
