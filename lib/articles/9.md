# Prepare Yourself for SportsFix Telegram Referral Program!

Check out our Twitter here. And visit our site here.

Welcome game changers! We are thrilled to have close to **5,000 new members **in our Telegram community channel, [t.me/sfico](http://t.me/sfico). To celebrate this milestone, we are about to launch our Telegram Referral Program!

Having introduced our official SportsFix Bounty Campaign on Bitcointalk.org. in early July, we have gained good traction within the cryptocurrency community. As of today, SportsFix Bounty Campaign has gained more than **3,000 new members** in our social and community channels — an exciting phase in building our sports crypto community!

In the second phase of our bounty campaign, we are introducing **Telegram Referral Program**, dedicated to reward those who spread the news of our Telegram channel, the referrer, and to reward new members, the referrie!

For example, if you share our referral link to a friend you will receive **3,000 PTS **for every friend who joins our telegram channel. To make it even sweeter, the referrie –your friend who joins our Telegram through your referral link, will receive **2,000 PTS**!

At the end of the program convert ALL your points, from all the tasks, based on this tier system below:

![Higher PTS will get you more SFT!](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*bwf8dh64ehJZN8mQ7viR-A.png)*Higher PTS will get you more SFT!*

For example, if you have 30,000 points right now then you will get: **30,000 / 80 = 375 SFT**. But if you have 45,000 points then you will get: **45,000 / 50 = 900 SFT**. *So, higher points will get you more SFT!*

IT’S GAME TIME! We’re changing the way YOU watch sports!
