“To change the world in Sports TV is a long term battle,” Hung said in an interview. “I believe a good team is the key successful factor to a successful ICO project and a good leader like Carl Kirchhoff can bring the business to the next level.”

Our CEO, [**Carl Kirchhoff](https://twitter.com/CarlKir)** is a thought leader in sports and technology industry for more than 15 years, and is now leading SportsFix, the first over-the-top (OTT) platform for live streaming and video-on-demand (VOD) in ASEAN region.

Sitting on the sixth position on ICO Bench, helping raise US$200 million in the last few months, and advising more than 35 ICO projects, Hung is selective in advising ICO projects.

“I only advise an ICO project if it is serious –which means it has early capital investment, the core team is strong and the executive has a good track record and not just an idea.” Hung explained that he receives more than five project invitations daily, and rejects more than 95% of the ICO invitations.

Integrating the implementation of blockchain technology and smart contracts, SportsFix will enable fans to take part in the emergence of a revolutionary financial ecosystem for sports.
> # Hung agrees.“The sports ecosystem has gained more attention in the last ten years and there is so much potential for using blockchain in sports.”

Hung, who is familiar with more than 20 industries and previously involved in more than 250 global enterprise businesses while consulting at a cloud-based software application Oracle ERP, reveals the opportunities in blockchain technology.

“One the most promising about blockchain technology is its ability to monetize data and to build communities.”

And this is what SportsFix aims to achieve!

Our Digital Stadium is a seamless platform dedicated for sports communities worldwide to enjoy their favorite sports contents and to create an immersive engagement between fans, allowing more autonomy and transparency for sports communities to thrive.

Fuelled by our native cryptocurrency SportsFix token (SFT), the token economy around live game content will bring sports communities across the globe together where everyone can deeply engage with their favorite clubs, other fans, and earn rewards from sponsors.
