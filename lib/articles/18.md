> “There were many strong companies with amazing technologies out there and we are humbled to win this prize at the first ICO/ crypto event we’ve participated in. This is a testament for the clear need of decentralization of an ecosystem controlled by a few players and saturated with middlemen mark-ups and artificial packaging and pricing of content.”

The fancentric SportsFix Token (SFT) allows fans to participate and engage with their favourite leagues and clubs in a self-contained economy, placing power back in the hands of fan bases worldwide!
