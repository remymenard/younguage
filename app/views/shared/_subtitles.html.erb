<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="9.003" data-end="11.065">Hi everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="11.825" data-end="16.625">Two year ago, my life changed forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="16.625" data-end="19.261">My wife Kelsey and I</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="19.261" data-end="23.032">welcomed our daughter Lelainto the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="23.033" data-end="27.456">Now, becoming a parentis an amazing experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="27.456" data-end="30.704">Your whole world changes over night.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="30.704" data-end="33.285">And all of your prioritieschange immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="33.285" data-end="39.294">So fast that it makes it really difficultto process sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="39.294" data-end="43.547">Now, you also have to learna tremendous amount about being a parent</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="43.547" data-end="46.82">like, for example,how to dress your child.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="46.82" data-end="47.954">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="47.954" data-end="50.091">This was new to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="50.091" data-end="53.844">This is an actual outfit,I thought this was a good idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="53.844" data-end="59.558">And even Lela knowsthat it's not a good idea. (Laughter)</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="59.558" data-end="64.409">So there is so much to learn andso much craziness all at once.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="64.409" data-end="68.533">And to add to the craziness,Kelsey and I both work from home,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="68.533" data-end="71.223">we're entrepreneurs,we run our own businesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="71.223" data-end="76.992">So, Kelsey develops coursesonline for yoga teachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="76.992" data-end="78.333">I'm an author.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="78.333" data-end="80.782">And so, I'm working from home,Kelsey's working from home.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="80.782" data-end="83.901">We have an infantand we're trying to make sure</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="83.901" data-end="86.725">that everything gets donethat needs done.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="86.725" data-end="91.107">And life is really, really busy.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="92.357" data-end="96.718">And a couple of weeksinto this amazing experience,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="96.718" data-end="100.247">when the sleep deprivationreally kicked in,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="100.247" data-end="102.299">like around week eight,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="102.299" data-end="105.732">I had this thought,and it was the same thought</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="105.732" data-end="109.773">that parents across the ages,internationally,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="109.773" data-end="112.467">everybody has had this thought,which is:</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="112.467" data-end="118.054">I am never going to havefree time ever again.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="118.054" data-end="119.183">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="119.183" data-end="122.403">Somebody said it's true.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="122.403" data-end="125.214">It's not exactly true,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="125.214" data-end="129.865">but it feels really, really truein that moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="129.866" data-end="132.075">And this was reallydisconcerning to me,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="132.075" data-end="135.483">because one of the things that I enjoy</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="135.484" data-end="139.428">more than anything elseis learning new things.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="139.428" data-end="142.261">Getting curious about somethingand diving in</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="142.261" data-end="145.164">and fiddling around andlearning through trial and error.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="145.164" data-end="148.44">And eventually becoming pretty goodat something.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="148.44" data-end="152.335">And without this free time,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="152.336" data-end="156.405">I didn't know how I was evergoing to do that ever again.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="156.405" data-end="158.877">And so, I'm a big geek,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="158.877" data-end="162.07">I want to keep learning things,I want to keep growing.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="162.07" data-end="165.087">And so what I've decided to do was,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="165.087" data-end="167.784">go to the library,and go to the bookstore,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="167.784" data-end="169.922">and look at what research says about</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="169.922" data-end="173.523">how we learn and how we learn quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="173.523" data-end="176.834">And I read a bunch of books,I read a bunch of websites.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="176.834" data-end="179.091">And tried to answer this question,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="179.091" data-end="183.04">how long does it taketo acquire a new skill?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="183.04" data-end="185.117">You know what I found?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="185.117" data-end="189.438">10,000 hours!</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="189.438" data-end="191.2">Anybody ever heard this?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="191.2" data-end="194.134">It takes 10,000 hours.If you want to learn something new,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="194.134" data-end="195.573">if you want to be good at it,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="195.584" data-end="197.934">it's going to take 10,000 hoursto get there.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="197.934" data-end="201.454">And I read this in book after book,in website after website.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="201.455" data-end="208.421">And my mental experienceof reading all of this stuff was like:</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="208.421" data-end="210.798">No!!</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="210.799" data-end="214.539">I don't have time!I don't have 10,000 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="214.539" data-end="219.088">I am never going to be ableto learn anything new.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="219.088" data-end="222.421">Ever again.(Laughter)</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="222.421" data-end="223.478">But that's not true.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="223.479" data-end="226.559">So, 10,000 hours, just to give youa rough order of magnitude,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="226.559" data-end="232.422">10,000 hours is a full-time jobfor five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="232.422" data-end="234.008">That's a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="234.008" data-end="236.364">And we've all had the experienceof learning something new,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="236.364" data-end="240.439">and it didn't take us anywhereclose to that amount of time, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="240.439" data-end="243.505">So, what's up? There's somethingkinda funky going on here.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="243.505" data-end="247.078">What the research says and what we expect,and have experiences,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="247.078" data-end="249.416">they don't match up.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="249.416" data-end="252.993">And what I found, here's the wrinkle:</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="252.993" data-end="259.721">The 10,000 hour rule came out of studiesof expert-level performance.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="259.721" data-end="262.227">There's a professorat Florida State University,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="262.228" data-end="264.226">his name is K. Anders Ericsson.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="264.226" data-end="266.725">He is the originatorof the 10,00 hour rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="266.725" data-end="271.261">And where that came from is,he studied professional athletes,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="271.261" data-end="275.763">world class musicians,chess grand masters.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="275.763" data-end="280.775">All of this ultra competitive folksin ultra-high performing fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="280.775" data-end="283.751">And he tried to figure outhow long does it take</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="283.751" data-end="286.811">to get to the topof those kinds of fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="286.811" data-end="289.668">And what he found is,the more deliberate practice,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="289.668" data-end="292.194">the more timethat those individuals spend</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="292.194" data-end="295.304">practicing the elementsof whatever it is that they do,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="295.304" data-end="297.246">the more time you spend,the better you get.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="297.246" data-end="300.164">And the folks at the tippy topof their fields</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="300.165" data-end="305.101">put in around 10,000 hours of practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="305.101" data-end="309.442">Now, we were talking about the gameof telephone a little bit earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="309.442" data-end="311.236">Here's what happened:</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="311.236" data-end="313.457">an author by the nameof Malcolm Gladwell</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="313.458" data-end="317.901">wrote a book in 2007 called"Outliers: The Story of Success",</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="317.901" data-end="321.592">and the central piece of that bookwas the 10,000 hour rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="321.592" data-end="325.642">Practice a lot, practice well,and you will do extremely well,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="325.642" data-end="327.367">you will reach the top of your field.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="327.367" data-end="329.472">So, the message,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="329.472" data-end="332.455">what Dr. Ericsson was actually saying is,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="332.455" data-end="337.425">it takes 10,000 hours to getat the top of an ultra competitive field</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="337.425" data-end="341.857">in a very narrow subject,that's what that means.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="341.857" data-end="345.294">But here's what happened:ever since Outliers came out,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="345.294" data-end="347.448">immediately came out,reached the top of best seller lists,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="347.449" data-end="350.056">stayed there for three solid months.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="350.056" data-end="354.171">All of a sudden the 10,000 hour rulewas everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="354.171" data-end="360.022">And a society-wide game of telephonestarted to be played.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="360.022" data-end="364.955">So this message, it takes 10,000 hoursto reach the top of an ultra competitive field,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="364.955" data-end="369.926">became, it takes 10,000 hoursto become an expert at something,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="369.927" data-end="371.366">which became,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="371.366" data-end="375.667">it takes 10,000 hours to becomegood at something,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="375.667" data-end="377.191">which became,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="377.192" data-end="381.455">it takes 10,000 hoursto learn something.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="381.455" data-end="385.337">But that last statement,it takes 10,000 hours to learn something,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="385.337" data-end="388.599">is not true.It's not true.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="388.6" data-end="393.346">So, what the research actually says --</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="393.346" data-end="396.217">I spent a lot of time hereat the CSU library</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="396.217" data-end="399.522">in the cognitive psychology stacks'cause I'm a geek.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="399.523" data-end="404.216">And when you actually lookat the studies of skill acquisition,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="404.216" data-end="408.039">you see over and overa graph like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="408.039" data-end="411.693">Now, researchers,whether they're studying a motor skill,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="411.694" data-end="414.328">something you do physicallyor a mental skill,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="414.328" data-end="417.174">they like to study thingsthat they can time.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="417.174" data-end="419.185">'Cause you can quantify that, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="419.185" data-end="422.452">So, they'll give research participantsa little task,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="422.452" data-end="424.156">something that requiresphysical arrangement,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="424.156" data-end="428.925">or something that requireslearning a little mental trick,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="428.925" data-end="433.357">and they'll time how long a participanttakes to complete the skill.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="433.357" data-end="436.095">And here's what this graph says,when you start --</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="436.095" data-end="440.398">so when researchers gave participantsa task, it took them a really long time,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="440.398" data-end="443.053">'cause it was newand they were horrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="443.053" data-end="446.651">With a little bit of practice,they get better and better and better.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="446.651" data-end="450.632">And that early part of practiceis really, really efficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="450.632" data-end="456.021">People get good at thingswith just a little bit of practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="456.021" data-end="459.663">Now, what's interesting to note is that,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="459.663" data-end="462.869">for skills that we want to learnfor ourselves,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="462.869" data-end="465.736">we don't care so much about time,right?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="465.736" data-end="469.283">We just care about how good we are,whatever good happens to mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="469.283" data-end="474.943">So if we relabel performance timeto how good you are,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="474.943" data-end="479.346">the graph flips, and you gethis famous and widely known,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="479.346" data-end="481.274">this is the learning curve.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="481.274" data-end="483.852">And the story of the learning curveis when you start,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="483.852" data-end="486.566">you're grossly incompetentand you know it, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="486.567" data-end="488.635">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="488.635" data-end="491.997">With a little bit of practice,you get really good, really quick.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="491.997" data-end="495.715">So that early level of improvementis really fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="495.715" data-end="498.63">And then at a certain pointyou reach a plateau,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="498.63" data-end="501.96">and the subsequent gamesbecome much harder to get,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="501.96" data-end="504.659">they take more time to get.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="504.659" data-end="508.62">Now, my question is,I want that, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="508.62" data-end="511.605">How long does it takefrom starting something</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="511.605" data-end="515.265">and being grossly incompetentand knowing it</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="515.265" data-end="517.574">to being reasonably good?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="517.575" data-end="522.329">In hopefully, as short a period of timeas possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="522.328" data-end="524.539">So, how long does that take?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="524.539" data-end="529.518">Here's what my research says: 20 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="529.518" data-end="533.163">That's it.You can go from knowing nothing</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="533.163" data-end="535.739">about any skill that you can think of.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="535.739" data-end="539.175">Want to learn a language?Want to learn how to draw?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="539.175" data-end="542.294">Want to learn how to juggleflaming chainsaws?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="542.294" data-end="543.319">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="543.32" data-end="548.532">If you put 20 hours of focuseddeliberate practice into that thing,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="548.532" data-end="550.964">you will be astounded.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="550.964" data-end="554.135">Astounded at how good you are.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="554.135" data-end="555.645">20 hours is doable,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="555.645" data-end="559.956">that's about 45 minutes a dayfor about a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="559.956" data-end="562.066">Even skipping a couple days,here and there.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="562.066" data-end="565.221">20 hours isn't that hard to accumulate.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="565.221" data-end="568.1">Now, there's a method to doing this.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="568.1" data-end="571.097">Because it's not like you can just startfiddling around for about 20 hours</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="571.097" data-end="573.044">and expect these massive improvements.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="573.044" data-end="575.713">There's a way to practice intelligently.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="575.713" data-end="577.997">There's a way to practice efficiently,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="577.997" data-end="581.05">that will make sure that you investthose 20 hours</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="581.051" data-end="583.592">in the most effective waythat you possibly can.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="583.592" data-end="587.518">And here's the method,it applies to anything:</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="587.518" data-end="591.363">The first is to deconstruct the skill.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="591.363" data-end="596.262">Decide exactly what you wantto be able to do when you're done,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="596.262" data-end="602.071">and then look into the skilland break it down into smaller pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="602.072" data-end="606.042">Most of the thingsthat we think of as skills</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="606.042" data-end="610.639">are actually big bundles of skillsthat require all sorts of different things.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="610.639" data-end="614.211">The more you can break apart the skill,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="614.211" data-end="616.583">the more you're able to decide,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="616.583" data-end="618.973">what are the parts of this skillthat would actually help me</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="618.974" data-end="621.365">get to what I want?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="621.365" data-end="623.758">And then you can practice those first.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="623.758" data-end="625.96">And if you practicethe most important things first,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="625.96" data-end="628.731">you'll be able to improveyour performance</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="628.731" data-end="631.502">in the least amount of time possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="631.502" data-end="634.272">The second is, learn enoughto self correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="634.273" data-end="638.467">So, get three to five resourcesabout what it is you're trying to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="638.467" data-end="643.718">Could be book, could be DVDs,could be courses, could be anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="643.719" data-end="648.95">But don't use those as a wayto procrastinate on practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="648.95" data-end="650.585">I know I do this, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="650.585" data-end="652.661">Get like 20 books about the topic,like,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="652.661" data-end="655.137">"I'm going to start learninghow to program a computer</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="655.138" data-end="657.615">when I complete these 20 books".</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="657.615" data-end="660.094">No. That's procrastination.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="660.094" data-end="664.141">What you want to dois learn just enough</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="664.141" data-end="665.849">that you can actually practice</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="665.85" data-end="670.914">and self correct or self editas you practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="670.914" data-end="673.819">So the learning becomesa way of getting better</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="673.819" data-end="676.723">at noticingwhen you're making a mistake</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="676.724" data-end="679.63">and then doing somethinga little different.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="679.63" data-end="684.106">The third is to remove barriersto practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="684.106" data-end="686.55">Distractions, television, internet.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="686.55" data-end="689.929">All of these thingsthat get in the way</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="689.929" data-end="693.308">of you actually sitting downand doing the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="693.308" data-end="696.689">And the more you're able to usejust a little bit of willpower</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="696.689" data-end="699.887">to remove the distractions thatare keeping you from practicing,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="699.887" data-end="706.27">the more likely you are to actuallysit down and practice, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="706.27" data-end="711.473">And the fourth is to practicefor at least 20 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="711.473" data-end="714.77">Now, most skills have what I calla frustration barrier.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="714.77" data-end="718.078">You know, the grossly-incompetent-and-knowing-it part?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="718.078" data-end="722.374">That's really, really frustrating.We don't like to feel stupid.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="722.374" data-end="727.314">And feeling stupid is a barrier to usactually sitting down and doing the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="727.314" data-end="731.762">So, by pre-committing to practicingwhatever it is that you want to do</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="731.762" data-end="734.377">for at least 20 hours,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="734.378" data-end="738.918">you will be able to overcomethat initial frustration barrier</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="738.918" data-end="743.029">and stick with the practice long enoughto actually reap the rewards.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="743.029" data-end="745.368">That's it! It's not rocket science.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="745.368" data-end="750.479">Four very simple steps thatyou can use to learn anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="751.466" data-end="755.302">Now, this is easy to talkabout in theory,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="755.302" data-end="757.703">but it's more fun to talk aboutin practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="757.703" data-end="761.964">So one of the things that I've wantedto learn how to do for a long time</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="761.964" data-end="764.163">is play the ukulele.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="764.163" data-end="767.787">Has anybody seenJake Shimabukuro's TEDTalk</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="767.787" data-end="770.901">where he plays the ukuleleand makes it sound like --</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="770.901" data-end="772.26">he's like a ukulele god.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="772.26" data-end="774.026">It's amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="774.026" data-end="777.205">I saw it, I was like,"That is so cool!"</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="777.206" data-end="781.373">It's such a neat instrument.I would really like to learn how to play.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="781.373" data-end="783.96">And so I decidedthat to test this theory</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="783.96" data-end="787.636">I wanted to put 20 hoursinto practicing ukulele</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="787.636" data-end="789.819">and see where it got.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="789.819" data-end="793.635">And so the first thingabout playing the ukulele is,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="793.635" data-end="797.701">in order to practice,you have to have one, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="797.701" data-end="801.791">So, I got an ukulele and-- My lovely assistant?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="801.791" data-end="804.526">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="804.526" data-end="809.973">Thank you sir.I think I need the chord here.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="811.58" data-end="815.569">It's not just an ukulele,it's an electric ukulele. (Laughter)</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="815.569" data-end="817.204">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="820.635" data-end="825.194">So, the first couple hours are justlike the first couple hours of anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="825.195" data-end="828.554">You have to get the toolsthat you are using to practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="828.554" data-end="830.616">You have to make surethey're available.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="830.616" data-end="832.582">My ukulele didn't comewith strings attached.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="832.582" data-end="834.548">I had to figure outhow to put those on.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="834.548" data-end="836.515">Like, that's kind of important, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="836.515" data-end="838.468">And learning how to tune,learning how to make sure</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="838.468" data-end="840.32">that all of the thingsthat need to be done</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="840.321" data-end="844.515">in order to start practicingget done, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="844.515" data-end="851.187">Now, one of the things when I wasready to actually start practicing</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="851.187" data-end="855.996">was I looked in online databasesand songbooks for how to play songs.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="855.996" data-end="859.088">And they say, okay, ukuleles, you canplay more than one string at a time,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="859.088" data-end="860.968">so you can play chords, that's cool,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="860.969" data-end="864.242">you are accompanying yourself,yay you. (Laughter)</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="864.242" data-end="868.356">And when I started looking at songs,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="868.356" data-end="872.471">I had an ukulele chord bookthat had like hundreds of chords.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="872.471" data-end="875.534">Looking at this and"Wow, that's intimidating".</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="875.534" data-end="877.859">But when you look at the actual songs,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="877.859" data-end="882.71">you see the same chordsover and over, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="882.71" data-end="886.299">As it turns out, playing the ukuleleis kind of like doing anything,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="886.299" data-end="889.552">There's a very small set of thingsthat are really important</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="889.552" data-end="892.422">and techniques that you'll useall the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="892.422" data-end="898.42">And in most songsyou'll use four, maybe five chords,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="898.42" data-end="900.228">and that's it, that's the song.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="900.229" data-end="904.993">You don't have to know hundreds,as long as you know the four or the five.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="904.993" data-end="906.813">So, while I was doing my research,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="906.813" data-end="911.264">I found a wonderful little medleyof pop songs</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="911.264" data-end="916.178">by a band called Axis of Awesome.(Whistles)</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="916.178" data-end="919.199">-- Somebody knows it. --</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="919.199" data-end="923.418">And what Axis of Awesome saysis that you can learn,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="923.418" data-end="927.017">or you can play pretty muchany pop song of the past five decades,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="927.017" data-end="928.685">if you know four chords,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="928.685" data-end="933.061">and those chords are G, D, Em and C.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="933.062" data-end="937.931">Four chords pump outevery pop song ever, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="937.931" data-end="939.401">So I thought, this is cool!</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="939.401" data-end="942.584">I would like to playevery pop song ever. (Laughter)</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="942.584" data-end="945.627">So, that was the first songI decided to learn,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="945.627" data-end="949.444">and I would like to actuallyshare it with you. Ready?</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="949.445" data-end="951.423">(Applause)Alright.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="951.423" data-end="954.733">(Music)</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="963.6" data-end="966.104">(Singing)Just a small town girl,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="966.104" data-end="968.878">living in a lonely world,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="968.878" data-end="974.652">she took the midnight traingoing anywhere.</span></p>

<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="1110.752" data-end="1115.317">The major barrier to learnsomething new is not intellectual,</span> <span class="youtube-marker" data-start="1115.317" data-end="1120.998">it's not the process of you learninga bunch of little tips or tricks or things.</span></p>

<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="1131.537" data-end="1135.633">So the major barrier's not intellectual,it's emotional.</span></p>
<p><span class="youtube-marker" data-start="1135.633" data-end="1138.971">But put 20 hours into anything.</span></p>
